>>SEAN MCNAMARA: What the
out-of-body experience, as well

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
as clairvoyance and telepathy,
show us is that some part of us

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
does extend in a non-physical
manner beyond the body

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and beyond space and time.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The physical brain,
these three pounds

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of wet matter inside our
skulls-- that's the veil.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And its job is to
keep us grounded

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
in this temporary existence, so
it blocks a lot of information

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
out, including that
part of our self

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that is more than physical.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How do you teach
other people to be psychic?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It's really about
relaxation and just repetition.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And when people are open to
it and don't overthink it,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:90%
they'll succeed.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And they still don't understand,
like, how did I do that?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tricky part is
we don't know exactly how it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:90%
happens, just that it does.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:90%

to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:10%
Sean McNamara, with us, began
to experience psychic abilities

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:10%
in his 30s--

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:10%
he's not that old now.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And after becoming
frustrated with the direction

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
his spiritual life
had taken, he decided

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Sean, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
happen to you, though?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, there
was a personal crisis

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:10%
is the best way to put it.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:10%
I grew up as a religious
person, and as a younger adult,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:10%
I pursued other formal
religions to find some answers

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:10%
for myself.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:10%
And it was all based
on my fear of death.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.108 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: When I was a
kid, I had an appendectomy.

00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I had appendicitis,
and I didn't know

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.667 align:middle line:84%
what it was when the
pain started coming on.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So there were a few
days where I was--

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not good.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --in
excruciating pain,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and then my parents
took me to the hospital.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
encounter, basically,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:90%
with my own mortality.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
When the surgery was over,
and I came out of it,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
they said my
appendix had ruptured

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
while they were taking it out.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And they told me if I
hadn't been in the hospital,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:90%
things could have gone--

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would have died.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: I would have died.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would have died.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And so as a child,
to start thinking about that,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it just became a formative
force in my life.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I was always haunted
by this idea of death

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:90%
and what happens afterward.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised Catholic, and
so there's that belief system

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As I was.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.158 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're like
me-- this way, too.

00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a stubborn
person, and I want

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to find answers for myself, so
I wasn't really satisfied just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:90%
being told what to believe.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in my young
adulthood, I started

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
practicing Buddhism to see if
maybe meditating would give me

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
a way to find answers about
the afterlife for myself.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that I
just did a good job of being

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
a good Buddhist, following the
tradition, and along the way,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I forgot my real
mission, which was

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to find real answers
about life and death.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And I also was just a
little bit disappointed

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.573 align:middle line:84%
by what I saw from
different teachers

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and how they treated
other people.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I just became frustrated,
and I realized

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I need to find my own way and
stop looking to other people

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.565 align:middle line:90%
to offer me answers.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can give you a
little idea once in a while,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:90%
but that's about it.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.187 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: That's about it.

00:03:09.187 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
religions or traditions

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of information
that's passed on

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and the people passing them
on, it's their job, in a sense,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:90%
to preserve the information.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your
own information that's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
different than
what's being taught,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
then that's a threat
to the tradition

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.755 align:middle line:90%
because it's different.

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And they
don't like that.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I really wasn't
satisfied just resembling

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.057 align:middle line:84%
what they were
teaching or following

00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that fixed path anymore because
it wasn't going where I really

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:90%
needed to go with my life.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So I needed to find my own
way and create my own path.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
reading more books about how

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to have an out of
body experience

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.495 align:middle line:84%
because I figured if
I could find a way

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to leave my body before I
die, that would really give me

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
a direct answer about, is
any part of me not physical?

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.077 align:middle line:84%
Will any part of me
exist after my body dies?

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, Sean,
the older one gets,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the closer one thinks
about the dying process.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But I'm at a point in
my life right now where

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in a rush to get there,
but I'm not afraid anymore.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
I used to be.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I used to be concerned
like you did.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But after interviewing so
many people about what it is,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced we don't die.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:90%
We just move on.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not ready to move on,
but when that time comes,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll be ready.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: When I imagine
the advantage you have

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
is that you've heard so
many stories from people,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that they're touching on
that truth in different ways,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
but they're authentic.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.612 align:middle line:90%
They're experience-based.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's so many
of them saying the same thing.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dannion Brinkley--
dead three times.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But you talked about your
out-of-body experiences.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to do
that at will now?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Not exactly.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those people that
with any psychic ability that I

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
do, I have to work
really, really

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
diligently at it for a period
of time before it happens.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So I know some
people can probably

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.233 align:middle line:84%
lay down on any
night of the week

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and have an out-of-body
experience that night.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
For me, I have to do the
training for several weeks,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had one
when I was 11--

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
haven't done it since.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Can't do it.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll do it at my
dream state maybe.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, sometimes it'll
happen spontaneously,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
or if life arranges
it that way for it

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to happen for you for
a reason, perhaps.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
For me, I need to do certain
techniques over and over again

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
until it happens,
and that might be

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:90%
that way for other people too.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They receive the instructions,
but it's up to them

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to put in the work, and
then find their own answers

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
or interpret their own
experience afterwards.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I think keeps
it an authentic experience

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that no two out-of-body
experiences are alike.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.922 align:middle line:84%
Some are similar, but I've never
had two that are exactly alike.

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talking about
out-of-body experiences,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia's "Open
Minds," they talked

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
about that and the merging
of out-of-body experiences

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
with meeting a
perceptive person.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're out of
body, they're in-body,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:90%
and they can see you.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's what
I'm referring to.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That has happened.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a little
bit more difficult--

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.668 align:middle line:84%
>> --because, really, that
person needs to have a lot

00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of intuition or clairvoyance
or clear audience.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:90%
They might be able to hear you.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it really boils down
to whether the person

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
at that moment can
perceive something

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that the physical
person, I mean,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:90%
when you are outside the body.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, many
people are psychic.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Many people have abilities
that go beyond the five senses.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
What happens many times-- and
I many times mention this--

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
what happens many times is that
the physical reality attracts

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
our attention to the
physical reality,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and normally, most people don't
go around with their antennas

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
on trying to see who is around
there or who is around them.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Even the people who
are listening to us

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, they
could ask themselves,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
during this 20 minutes that
we've been in this chat here,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:90%
who has been standing around me?

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably this is an idea or
a question that we hadn't asked

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.385 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, but it doesn't mean
that there was somebody there.

00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put
anybody-- you know,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to scare anybody.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
But there could have been.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.277 align:middle line:84%
>> And we could
have perceived it.

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply that we don't
go around with our antennas on.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I envy people, Sean,
who can do OBEs at will.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:90%
They just, poof.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.697 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Wouldn't
that be nice?

00:07:36.697 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert Monroe, the late
Robert Monroe was one of them.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah, I think
as a modern society,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
we owe a debt of
gratitude to Robert Monroe

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
because not only did he come to
understand his own experiences,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and at first, he
thought he was crazy.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:90%
He went to see his--

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he
thought there was

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with himself.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.833 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --I think
it was a psychologist.

00:07:53.833 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he figured it
out and wrote about it,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and then a lot more people
started to learn about it.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Luis Minero, who we just saw--

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I relied on his book when
I was training myself--

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --along
with other books.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small world.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It was
a wonderful treat

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to see him just now
because these people who

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
spread the information,
and thank you

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to the internet and the
availability of books, people

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
are getting educated faster
and more efficiently than ever

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
before in these abilities where
before, if you were a witch,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%
you would be burned.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely right.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.947 align:middle line:84%
Now, you continue to teach
people psychically, don't you?

00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I do, but
I have online courses.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have a small group
of friends in Denver,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and we get together every few
months and do some experiments.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've been doing
that for a few years

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.818 align:middle line:90%
with different sets of people.

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But we've done some very
interesting work, particularly

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:90%
with remote viewing.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you touch
on all this, don't you?

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: For me, they're
all the same thing at the core,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.187 align:middle line:84%
and that's about
information transfer.

00:08:51.187 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We might think of the
out-of-body experience

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
as some part of me is
leaving my physical body,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and clairvoyance is that the
information is coming to me

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:90%
while I'm awake, let's say.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it's really
about the information

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that is me perceiving
the information

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of another world or a picture
that I'll be shown tomorrow.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, the future
and past don't really matter.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Time doesn't work the same
way in the psychic space.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's information
influencing or perceiving

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:90%
other objects of information.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The more you got into
this, Sean, the better you get.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:90%
What areas did you enhance--

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities,
remote viewing,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned, how
about clairvoyance?

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Did all those get
better for you?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: They get better
when I practice consistently.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The challenge for me
is my own belief system

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
because I'm really
hard on myself.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Actually, that's one component.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The other component is the
amount of stress in my life.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
good for people who

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
want to learn these abilities
to understand that, in a sense,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
the last few years, when
I was really developing

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
these abilities, it's as if
the waters of the Dead Sea

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
had parted open.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.658 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: And I saw a path.

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:90%
But after that--

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt that.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --everything
closed down again.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And some part of
me doesn't believe

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
everything I've experienced.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I let that part
of me get too strong,

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
it's as if I shut
everything down.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.447 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a defense
mechanism of some type.

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you afraid of?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.155 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well,
some part of me

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't want
to fool myself.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's the danger of
writing about my experiences,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
sharing it with other people,
or if I teach a class,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.653 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I would teach
classes on telekinesis,

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
moving objects with
your mind, and there

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
would be people present
who thought I was crazy.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.253 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to--

00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
what if they're right?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:90%
What if I'm crazy?

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.545 align:middle line:84%
So that's a
psychological factor.

00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:43.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but if you're
crazy, we're all crazy.

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I do think it's
crazier to think that all

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%
we are are blood and bones.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the out-of-body
experience as well as

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance and telepathy
show us is that some part of us

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
does extend, in a nonphysical
manner, beyond the body

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and beyond space
and time and can

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
communicate with other beings
too, human or otherwise.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So all these
experiences are evidence

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are so much more, as
Robert Monroe used to say,

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.105 align:middle line:84%
we are more than
our physical body.

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of the
work of Theresa Bullard?

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: No.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
well, you're going

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to see what she
has to say, and I

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
want to get your reaction
right after that, Sean.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But to begin with, this
physical body is not who we

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%
The body is a vehicle.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Who we are, our true
life, is eternal spirit

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:90%
or intelligent mind.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
If we widen our view of
life beyond the physical,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
if we take into account
the progression of spirit

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, we must
look at a bigger picture.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We've explored elsewhere how our
universe is composed of 144,000

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:90%
rays or density levels.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
This physical realm exists
at the 144,000th ray,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the densest and
lowest vibration.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistic and Mystery
School teachings

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
describe how light forms
the material world.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
As the vibration slows down from
the highest spiritual source,

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
it passes through the full
electromagnetic spectrum

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
of light, and then it moves
through the octaves of sound.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It continues down through
the various density

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
levels, including
ether, and finally,

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:90%
materializes in the physical.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything vibrates at
specific frequency levels.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Here on Earth, we humans
are attuned to perceive

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and experience a relatively
narrow range of frequencies

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:90%
through our senses.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientifically, she's
pretty spot on, isn't she?

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well I think
she's got something there.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And my experiences in
the out-of-body state

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
connect with what she said
about different frequencies

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
or different levels because,
in my experience, when

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I seem to travel
to different areas

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
or have different
experiences, they

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
are different in
fundamental ways,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
as if I'm going from one
frequency to another.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So she's really on
to something there.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has a lot
to say about phenomena

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that we could relate psychic
abilities to, particularly

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
with mind over matter,
where your expectation

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and when you observe an
event can actually influence

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:90%
the outcome of an event.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe these things

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about
today, Sean, are physical

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:23.135 align:middle line:84%
and tied to the body, or
is it outside of that?

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: The
subjective experience--

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
perplexing question.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It is,
and it's complex.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But on one hand, we
are a combination

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of a physical body and a
brain and that part of us

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
that is more than that.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And the brain serves as a filter
and as a communication device,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
such as an antenna
on a television.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.063 align:middle line:84%
We are temporarily the
television set and the antenna.

00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're the receiver.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.522 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: We're the receiver.

00:13:48.522 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But we are also the signal,
and when the receiver dies,

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the signal continues on
through space and time.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
talk about crossing

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the veil in terms of life
and death or perceiving.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
My notion is that the
physical brain, these three

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:84%
pounds of wet matter inside
our skulls, that's the veil.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And its job is to
keep us grounded

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
in this temporary existence
to be human beings

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So it blocks a lot of
information out, including

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that part of our self that
is more than physical.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
If we knew the answers
at the back of the book,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
if we could see into
the future and learn

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the lessons ahead of time,
what would be the point?

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, our
brain, as the veil,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
serves a purpose to keep
us in this limited form

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
so that we make all those
dumb mistakes we make in life

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and learn from--

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over and over.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Over and
over and over again,

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.962 align:middle line:84%
because if we already
knew everything, then

00:14:42.962 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:90%
there would be no journey.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does prayer work?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I
believe it's not very

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
different from psychokinesis.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:90%
It's about intention.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.025 align:middle line:90%
It's about emotion, energy--

00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Affirmation.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --the direction
of the mind, affirmation,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's a--

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
prayer puts someone in a
place, in a state of mind

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
where they're open to larger
possibilities, where they're

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to
communicate with--

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
we could use the word
"God" or whatever language

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:90%
works for people.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever works.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It's a way of
turning on the antenna,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
making requests, looking at
the possibilities of life.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also a way of reflecting
on how one's life is going up

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to date, looking and
seeing, what could I change?

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:84%
What I wish would be different,
how could I be a better person,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and how can I connect to source
or God or to my higher self?

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of reaching
out, and, in a way,

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
just the act of reaching
out opens the door.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's remembering
who we really are.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't make sense
to pray if we really

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:90%
were just bones and blood.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't make sense.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:90%
So true.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Can we get better with
prayer to do things and make

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.552 align:middle line:90%
things happen?

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a practical
question about improving

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
our ability to pray
or meditate or do

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
any contemplative activity.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:10%
And today's challenge
in this century

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:10%
is, how much time can
we dedicate every day

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:10%
to connecting with
that part of ourself,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:10%
doing those types of
activities, versus feeding

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.103 align:middle line:10%
an addiction to social media or
watching too much television?

00:16:23.103 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or your smartphone.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Smartphone.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.848 align:middle line:84%
There are two very different
types of mental states.

00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say, by the
way, the average person

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:84%
looks at his smartphone
87 times a day.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.375 align:middle line:90%
I think that's low.

00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: [LAUGHS] I
might be with you there.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying--
lately, I've been

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to reduce that for
myself because I realize

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
brain can actually

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:84%
do an even stronger job than
it's intended to in keeping us

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies because of
the dopamine response,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
the addictive nature
of social media,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and it makes our brain
really fix us even more

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
in this physical,
limited way of being.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And so our access to that
larger part of ourselves

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
is minimized because of what's
happening just from looking

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:90%
at these devices all the time.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you brought up
something interesting though.

00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You bring up the brain, which
is tied into the physical body.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
What about outside of the brain?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Does it function?

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Does something function
outside of the brain?

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, for
example-- where

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:84%
does that originate--
in the brain or outside?

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I think the most
intriguing answer I can come up

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
with, which may be
wrong, is that it's

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:90%
beyond time and space.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's everywhere and
nowhere at the same time,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that it communicates--
while we're alive,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a junction between
that part of us, the larger

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:90%
part, and the physical brain.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:10%
Somehow, they have to interact.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
ask, are you-- are we

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:90%
just that big aspect?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Is that who we really are?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We are that, but we
also have to acknowledge

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that our brain and
our physical being

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
is a storehouse for our
temporary experiences.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So trauma, memories,
patterns, skills

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that we learn with this
body-- all that does

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
occur and depend on
the physical brain.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And stress.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: And stress.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just ignore
that human part of us.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It's an important part, at
least while we're alive.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when we pass
over, all that information

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we accrued in this
body gets passed on

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
or reabsorbed into that
larger part of our self,

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
into our soul or
spirit, for lack of--

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astral bodies.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Astral bodies.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, there might
be a record-keeping process

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
or a growth process.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the task of
consciousness in general

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is to learn and
expand continually.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So when consciousness
occupies a life form,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
whether it's human
or animal or other,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that's the opportunity
for consciousness

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to experience in a very
solid way, in a definite way,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and then take those experiences
with it when the body passes on

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and, perhaps, reincarnate
in another form

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
or some other form of existence.
we don't even know about.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
stress or trauma, Sean,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:90%
block our abilities to move on?

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well,
on a physical level,

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
traumas have a way of
interrupting the brain

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
processes of
communication, so to speak.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
someone is attacked,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and then they're asked
to give a police report,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
they might not even
be able to speak

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
because the center of
speech in the brain

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
has been separated
from the memory

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
section or some other
part of the brain.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so on a basic level,
trauma limits communication,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.522 align:middle line:84%
and communication is so
important to understand--

00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's critical.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --and connect
with even that spiritual part

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:90%
of ourself.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
We might be able to
receive information

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual realms
or the non-physical realms,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
but for us to understand
it with the brain process,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and then communicate
it with others,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the brain has to be
in a healthy state,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:90%
an open state, a relaxed state.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the best way,
perhaps, to shut a person's

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities down is to
continually stress them out

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
or keep them addicted to
technology, sadly to say.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia has
a program called

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
"Microdose," which
looks into astral travel

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and why it benefits us.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides having an experience
where you can fly anywhere

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or any time you want, what are
some of the other benefits you

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:90%
can get from this practice?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
According to a survey, 86% of
399 out-of-body participants

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
had a greater
awareness of reality.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Your whole reality changes.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Your perception of
reality changes.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Your-- what's important
to you changes.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:10%
And your emphasis in
through life changes.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:10%
Your trajectory in life
changes because you're

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:10%
no longer obsessed with
acquisition of things.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Another claimed benefit by
astral travelers is a decreased

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
fear of death due to the
realization of our immortality.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My fear of death
is completely gone.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I know, because you
know from experience.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:90%
We're immortal.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:90%
We create our own realities.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Other claims from OBEs
include increased psychic

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
abilities, the ability to
time travel and visit other

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, spontaneous
healing, meeting dead relatives

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and spirit guides, and
increased spirituality.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.977 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All of those are
possible, all of them.

00:21:23.977 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.018 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there's a whole part
of ourselves that is available,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
if we're willing to take
a chance, make the effort,

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
do the exploration, do
the studying involved.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
If anyone wants to
have the experience,

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and if their life allows
them to, because sometimes

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
life makes us have to
focus on other things, more

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
earthly things,
but it's available

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:90%
because it is part of ourselves.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.317 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- there's
no gatekeeping here.

00:21:52.317 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:90%
No one's in control.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we born with it?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Are we?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Born with
these abilities,

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or do we train them
and enhance them?

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Some
children report having

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
these abilities
naturally, and then they

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.390 align:middle line:84%
stop as the brain develops
and the child grows up.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think because
we are-- some part

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
of us is beyond space
and time, it was there

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
before we were born
from our mothers,

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be there after we
die and the body decomposes.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, yeah,
we are born with it

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's what
we have always been.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's important for me
to remember that who I am

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is still also largely,
right now for me,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
what I've experienced
in my, up to now,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
47 years on this
planet in this body.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So some part of me
existed before that,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
but who I identify with
now in my limited way,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
because I have this
brain, it's really

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I have to acknowledge the
relationships, the friendships,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the challenges, the
experiences in this life.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.667 align:middle line:90%
That's who I am, too.

00:22:52.667 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've done some work
with our friend, Paola Harris--

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Yes.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and Ricardo Gonzalez.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:90%
What did you do with them?

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well,
Ricardo is from Peru.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:90%
He's an experiencer.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:84%
He has been for many
years, and his ability

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
non-human entities who

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:90%
show up in the sky, so UFOs.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And he sometimes comes
to Crestone, Colorado,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
where Paola Harris
has some land.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And so over a weekend,
they host a group,

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
where we do meditations
and discussion,

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and then go out skywatching
for a couple nights

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and have experiences.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was really a
gift the first time

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.065 align:middle line:84%
I went with them because I'd
had some contact with non-human

00:23:34.065 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrials.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who drew them
in-- you or Ricardo?

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: No, Ricardo.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.985 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I was just there as
a visitor, as an observer.

00:23:40.985 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A witness.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: As a witness.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was there to verify--

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I had had experiences
in the liminal state,

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't see things
while I was awake,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
but I was in the out-of-body
state, let's say.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't sure, is this real?

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to go to
this real experience

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people,
with Ricardo and Paola.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when things showed
up in the sky, then I knew,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm not just
fooling myself.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else is seeing
the same thing I'm seeing.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And the first time
I went, Ricardo

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:84%
used a verification process
because sometimes something

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
can appear in the
sky, and it might

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
be a rocket returning through
the atmosphere and burning up.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.082 align:middle line:84%
But he had us do this technique
of asking for verification

00:24:22.082 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's a sense that
they're communicating with us.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So we saw this flashbulb--
it's just one example--

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.727 align:middle line:90%
a flashbulb in the sky.

00:24:29.727 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
now you have to ask,

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
please verify so
that I know it's you,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and that's something else.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.665 align:middle line:90%
We all ask, please verify--

00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:38.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
picked up on it.

00:24:38.082 --> 00:24:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And
they do another one.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And then
I saw one privately,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and I asked for verification,
and it did it just for me.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's the idea that
there's telepathic communication

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
happening, that we are connected
to them, they can communicate,

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and they'll do it through
telepathic thought or just

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.003 align:middle line:90%
a light in the sky.

00:24:58.003 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
there's always room

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
for doubt, which I think keeps
us sane, because the last thing

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to do is
believe in something

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.285 align:middle line:84%
and realize it was just
a balloon or something.

00:25:07.285 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How
psychically inclined

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:90%
do you say you would be, Sean?

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.122 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Because it's always
on my mind and I'm open to it,

00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
maybe more than
the average person.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little bit above average.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a superstar,
but for me, it's

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
just important to know that
I've had so much validation.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So much evidence has
been shown to me.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I have produced so much evidence
over and over and over again

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that I don't need to be
extremely psychic for the value

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:90%
to be there.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
know it's there.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: I know it's there.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It has served me
spontaneously several times.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Spontaneous things happen.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
unquestionable for me,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
except for those times
when I really doubt myself,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and my biggest joy, though, is
teaching it to other people.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you teach
other people to be psychic?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I take the
assumption that everybody

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is already psychic,
and then it's

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
a matter of taking them from
that everyday beta wavelength

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
state of mind to a more
alpha or theta stage,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.945 align:middle line:84%
just more relaxed and open,
and then setting intention,

00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
so depending on
if they're trying

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to perceive a picture they'll
see two hours in the future

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
or move an object
with their mind

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
or preparing them
to leave their body,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
it's really about relaxation,
about confidence, about

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:90%
comfort, and just repetition.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And when people are open to
it and don't overthink it,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:90%
they'll succeed.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it
happen so many times.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I can tell the people
who will struggle

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
the most in my classes.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.787 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right away?

00:26:38.787 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: They're
the smartest ones.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:84%
They're the physicists,
the mathematicians,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the engineers
because while they're

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
trying to do the
technique, they're

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
thinking way too hard about
it, and they're not entering

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:90%
that appropriate state of mind.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So I remind them,
just let it go.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked
about the blinking UFO

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and how you were
able to use your mind

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.340 align:middle line:84%
power to kind of summit it
up to communicate with you.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Recently, Nick
Pope, on Gaia News,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
talked about UFOs
and disclosure.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And he's on to something.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The big story, of course,
was the preliminary assessment

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
of unidentified aerial
phenomena produced by the Office

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Director of
National Intelligence.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It said that a lot
of these sightings

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:84%
could not be explained, even
after rigorous investigation

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
by the military.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:10%
It said that some of
these cases appeared

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:10%
to display the hallmarks
of advanced technology.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Two examples of that
are signature management

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and a degree of
radiofrequency energy.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So it was big.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
work is continuing,

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:90%
the all sorts of follow-up.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:10%
>> This year saw a number of
senior government officials

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:10%
speak out on the issue of UFOs
and potential extraterrestrial

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:10%
life.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> 2021 absolutely saw an uptick
in the number of senior people

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:90%
speaking out on this.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
We had former Director of
National Intelligence John

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Ratcliffe.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We had former CIA
Director James Woolsey,

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:84%
D&I Avril Haines, head of
NASA, spoke, Jeff Bezos spoke,

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and a number of others.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's
unprecedented, I think.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
One has had people,
like Luis Elizondo,

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of course, speaking out
on this for some time now.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
now is almost a sort

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
of validation of a lot of that,
when the senior folks pile in

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, there is
something to all this.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And who am I to rule out
even the extraterrestrial

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.123 align:middle line:90%
hypothesis?

00:28:51.123 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think the
world of Nick Pope.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
He's a great
investigator and has

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:90%
done some remarkable things.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.232 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're on to
something with this, aren't we?

00:29:00.232 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
What's surprising to me, though,
is that as these sightings

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
have shown up in the news
in the last few years,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that it's often not the headline
banner on any news website.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.910 align:middle line:90%
It's item number 4 or 5.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
it would be number one.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my friends
about it or the public, hey,

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.217 align:middle line:84%
do you remember the Tic Tac
UFO incident, for example?

00:29:22.217 --> 00:29:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And they haven't heard about it.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's as if some part
of the human mind

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
has a hard time taking
in this new information.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And it might just be
a process of time.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And as people get
accustomed to it,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
they'll start to respond
more strongly when

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.303 align:middle line:90%
these events occur on the news.

00:29:39.303 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
wave a magic wand,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Sean, over any psychic
student, what would you

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:90%
want them to accomplish?

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Oh, the
ability to express love.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: For
me, the biggest joy

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
of teaching psychic
abilities to people

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
has been watching
the students open up,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's an exchange
of friendship,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of trust and openness,
and the best experiences

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:84%
happen when there's the presence
of love in a person's heart.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Love fuels so many
of these experiences.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
reminder that we

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
are more than just physical
beings, some part of us

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
is deeply, deeply connected
to universal love.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so when a person can
feel that for him or herself

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and share it with someone
else and remind them,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
your limited self,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but there's something
so much more to you,

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that is the biggest gift
related to psychic abilities

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual phenomena.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does positive
thinking enhance this?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely,
because it requires

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:84%
trust, trust in
oneself, trust in life,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:84%
trust in something
bigger than ourselves,

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and you can't be
a positive thinker

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and be fearful or
angry at the same time.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.898 align:middle line:84%
They just don't work
at the same time.

00:30:59.898 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing when
some of these psychic events

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.045 align:middle line:90%
happen to us.

00:31:03.045 --> 00:31:05.977 align:middle line:84%
You almost sit back
and giggle because you

00:31:05.977 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And you go, I knew it.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It happens, doesn't it?

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: It does.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes my jaw
still lands on the floor

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:10%
when I see it happen, and I
love watching the surprise

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:10%
on my friends' faces
when they still

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.300 align:middle line:10%
have doubts about themselves,
and I show them the picture

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.490 align:middle line:10%
that they were trying
to perceive psychically.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a great match
for what they were drawing.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And they still don't understand,
like, how did I do that?

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tricky part is
we don't know exactly how it

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:90%
happens, just that it does.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's fun.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:90%
It's entertaining.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.010 align:middle line:10%
There's an almost permanent
sense of mystery to it

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.885 align:middle line:10%
because that part we can't know,
but we can experience it still.

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sean, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of the
wonders of being

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief"
and Gaia, of course,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:10%
is that we explore different
avenues of psychic ability.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:90%
People like Sean McNamara--

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that is somebody
who can help teach

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
us to get to the other side
in a very, very upbeat way.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
