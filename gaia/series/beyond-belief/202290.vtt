00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:25.025 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Simeon Hind with
us, the director

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
of the not-for-profit
Institute for Resonance

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
right here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The Institute is devoted to
the study of subtle energy,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
including remote
viewing, crop formations

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:90%
and related subjects.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Simeon, welcome to the program.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.203 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMEON HEIN: George,
thanks for having me today.

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is subtle energy?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.008 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, you know,
about 100 years ago, we

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
had this new scientific paradigm
called quantum mechanics.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And this subtle energy is how
quantum mechanics interacts

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
with us with biological systems,
living things, awareness,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who discovered this?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: Well, it was the work
of a lot of physicists back,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:10%
it was really
Albert Einstein that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:10%
discovered quantum mechanics.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But people began to wonder, how
do we interact with reality.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And are there very
sort of low level

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.068 align:middle line:84%
so-called ultra weak
energy sources that

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
are very difficult
to measure, but we

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
can tell that they're there.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.827 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: And that
we interact with,

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and it actually imbues us with
abilities that science really

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
hasn't recognized.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you say
we interact with them,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:90%
we tap into it?

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Or how is that relationship?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, we tap into it.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes get precognitive
sort of experiences.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you get gut
feelings about things.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole realm of
research about distant healing,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
how we can actually have
action, what Einstein called

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:90%
spooky action at a distance.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It's real.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
the wireless internet

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
where we're connected
to this energy force

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.115 align:middle line:84%
and it allows us to do
these amazing things?

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, I think that's
a really good analogy.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like an internet that
the universe already created,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
and it's there.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
just tap into it.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, we
tap, we're actually

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
all tapped into it all the
time, but nobody told us, right?

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In my case, it
says ethernet not connected.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, sometimes
it feels that way.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can some people do
it at ease, other people can't?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It really seems to do
with our social programming.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
From the moment we show
up here as little babies,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
we get a lot of programming
about what reality it.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: What's real,
what's not real.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're pushed in
certain directions to say,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
don't do this, this is sort of
weird, this is not ordinary,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're pushed in kind of
this ordinary normal direction.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I think as we get
older, become adults,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.763 align:middle line:84%
we push back some of these
sensory abilities we have

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and become less aware of it.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:90%
But it always pops through.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.345 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally pops
through, people

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
have experiences
they can't explain.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're right,
because as a child,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of different.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I loved sports and I
played all these things,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
but I was also obsessed with
psychic phenomena, UFOs,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
after life experiences
and all that.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 10
or 11 years old,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how could
that be, right?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.755 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good point.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Because as children, we
often have these experiences,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.035 align:middle line:84%
but we're told by
adults, that's not real.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
That's some sort of--

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My mom encouraged it.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Oh, good, you're lucky.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what happened.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, she
probably magnified it.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I had a
mom like that too.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're both
fortunate in that way.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She, I'm sure
she magnified my abilities

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:90%
by supporting what I was doing.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.778 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
she would bring me

00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
books on UFOs and consciousness
and stuff like that.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I'm a kid, and
she said, read this, Georgie,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
or read this.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: And you had a relative
too, didn't you, I remember.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, Dr.
Shafica Karagulla

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
was a psychiatrist who
changed her entire practice

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
from being a psychiatrist
to studying telepathy.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
She was obsessed with that.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
She wrote in a couple of
books, one being "Breakthrough

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to Creativity," and she just
changed her entire practice

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to devote herself to telepathy.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Sadly died in the tub when
a radio fell in her tub.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank God she wasn't
listening to my show.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:90%
That would been way too much.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, no, I mean,
we have these experiences.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
getting involved

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
with this area for
many of us, we're

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
so curious, we want to know how
does the universe really work,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.158 align:middle line:84%
what's our place in it,
we can't stop studying

00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
this and researching it, right?

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Because
there's so much there.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows
there's so much there.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia show,
"Buzzsaw," remote viewing

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
teacher, Ed Dames, who was
one of the government's

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
initial program
persons, tells us

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
what he's learned
about the agenda

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:90%
from ETs and remote viewing.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN STONE: What did you
learn about the ET phenomenon

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.992 align:middle line:10%
through your work
and psychic research?

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ED DAMES: Oh, that
would take weeks and weeks

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:10%
and weeks as a data dump.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:10%
I think the best thing
that, they, there

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:10%
is a federation out there
and we're not in it,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:10%
as George Carlin, late
George Carlin would say.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:10%
And the way to get in it is
not to try to second guess

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:10%
the lower levels
of the federation,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:10%
but to look to see if they would
allow Homo sapiens to become

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:10%
a member.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMES: But what
are their protocols?

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Not what do we think we
should do to gain members.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:10%
Shoot down with a
50 cal or whatever.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:10%
What should we do?

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:10%
How should we meet?

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:10%
And look at their protocols.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.295 align:middle line:10%
And because consciousness, I
believe, is the lingua franca.

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:10%
There's so many different
species and types

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:10%
of life form, the commonality
is not math or gravity,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:10%
it's consciousness.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:10%
So these consciousness
tools really

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:10%
become the foundation
for contact

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:10%
and looking into the various
different entities that

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:10%
are out there observing us.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:10%
What are their
protocols for contact?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out
that we're not mature

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.815 align:middle line:10%
enough generally
speaking, to have contact.

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:10%
They don't want
anything to do with us.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:10%
Want to observe this
madness down here.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:10%
But if you do display
an element of maturity

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:10%
in terms of their standards,
there will be contact.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:10%
So I'm looking forward
to doing that again.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed Dames'
nickname is, Simeon, is

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Doom, because he is kind of
negative about certain things.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's negative
about the ET approach

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
with good old planet Earth.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't think you are.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: No, you know, there's
so many different angles

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:90%
on this topic.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge topic.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
We're having a lot
of information coming

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
forth now more than ever.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's taken a while, but we're
getting around to disclosure,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
learning more about
who these visitors are.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
convinced there are visitors?

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Oh, there's no doubt.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.728 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen these
craft from time to time.

00:06:57.728 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was 10, just like when
you had your experiences,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I had my first experience
with my mom bird

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
watching in the Everglades.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.905 align:middle line:84%
And this huge thing came
over that was as bright as--

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wasn't
a bird, right?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.738 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: No, I thought it was
the moon until she pointed out

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that the moon was over there.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So no, there's no doubt that
these are real phenomena.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just, what is it.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tendency for us
to project our stories onto it,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
so it could be negative
or very positive.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But we have to realize a lot
of that's our own projection.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
We really don't know exactly
what we're dealing with.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.662 align:middle line:84%
But it's real, there's
no doubt about that.

00:07:28.662 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And beyond
that episode at 10,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
what was it that got you
into the field you're in now?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It really had
to do with hearing

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
people talk about
remote viewing when

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.436 align:middle line:90%
I got here to Boulder in 1996.

00:07:40.436 --> 00:07:41.236 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah And I initially
thought, this can't be real.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
telepathic abilities.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone would've told me
in all those years I spent

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.023 align:middle line:90%
in school and graduate school.

00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you came
late in this field.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Very late.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually after that sighting at
10, I read a couple of books.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, Timothy Good's
book "Above Top Secret,"

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
things like, a couple as a
teenager and kind of let it go.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.175 align:middle line:84%
And then got here to Boulder
and heard someone talk

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:90%
about remote viewing.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought, come on,
that can't be real.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.185 align:middle line:84%
But I went and took
a course in it,

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and I was really surprised
at my own results,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
thinking I'm just
an ordinary person

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
without any special
ability, and here, you

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
have almost a near
perfect description

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of a picture, a
target, we call it,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that you won't see
until after you're done.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was just kind
of hooked after that.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you never
stopped after that.

00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No, I never stopped.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
got into every area

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.242 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of phenomena.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Got into every area,
because all these paths

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
connect in some way.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not separate topics.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Our minds sometimes think
there's this and there's that.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But crop circles,
remote viewing,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:90%
somehow they all go together.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.143 align:middle line:84%
And you end up, if
you're a curious person,

00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
you really want
to know the facts,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you start investigating
these things, right?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.932 align:middle line:84%
And you see there's
really evidence for this.

00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, no one's
telling you about it.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.473 align:middle line:84%
And that was true
with remote viewing.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how
could this be real

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.863 align:middle line:84%
that you could take
an average person,

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
put them in a class
for a few days

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and they can start getting good
results describing target sites

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that they haven't seen
yet, and yet no one's

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
told me about this in
27 years of education?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Right.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of the government's program

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:90%
investigating remote viewing?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Ed Dames was
one of those members.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.927 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, he was,
he was part of it.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Russell Targ, Ingo
Swann and all those people.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.445 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of that program?

00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They, George,
they started doing this

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.008 align:middle line:90%
because they were afraid.

00:09:29.008 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the Russians.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Exactly right.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Soviets.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Exactly right.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:10%
They did it out of fear that
the other, our adversaries

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.835 align:middle line:10%
were going to gain on
us in this area of.

00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we don't do
it, they will, right?

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yes.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Psychotronic weapons,
as they called it.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot
of documents that

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
have come forth recently
showing that our intelligence

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
agencies were initially
saw this as a threat, not

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:90%
an opportunity.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's a threat,
the Russians, the Chinese.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:10%
And those countries had very
advanced programs in this.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%
They took it seriously.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
skepticism that we

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
do in the United States.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they eventually,
our government said, well,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
if they have it, we
have to investigate.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And they took people like Ingo
Swann, Pat Price and others.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The best of the best.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's really real,
and what can we do with it?

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did they stop it?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.863 align:middle line:90%
Or did they?

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Good question.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I ask that to
people like Ed Dames,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:90%
and he said it stopped.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
do you know that?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, because they're
not using us anymore,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and we were the
best of the best.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, that makes a little
sense, but why did they stop?

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Allegedly,
they stopped because it

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
needed funding that you
have to go to Congress.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.177 align:middle line:90%
There was the giggle factor.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a time when they
were doing a lot of budget

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
cutting in the mid '90s.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know if
it really stopped.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.253 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
passed to other programs,

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
just like we've heard the
AATIP program that studied UFOs

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon, it could be
shifted to another program,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
changed the name, no
one hears about it.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're also an
expert in crop circles, crop

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:90%
formations.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:90%
What on Earth are these things?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
How do we explain these?

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, if you have one
done by a group of people

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and it takes them 20 hours to
make, I can understand that.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But if there's just one
that you can't explain,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that's the story of the century.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, George,
I got into crop circles

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.732 align:middle line:90%
from remote viewing.

00:11:16.732 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I call it
actually, resonant viewing.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
really remote.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
tuning into a frequency.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Well.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always out there.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, it's
out there, and you're

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
deciding instead of
tuning into this room,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.225 align:middle line:84%
you're just tuning
into another signal.

00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's a type of resonance.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.212 align:middle line:84%
But the crop circles
kind of fit into that.

00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I did a few targets
on crop circles

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.927 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing my initial
training back in the '90s,

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even
know what they were.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I got out of graduate school,
crop circle, never heard

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
of that word.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to go
over there with a guy

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
from around here who was giving
tours there, Ron Russell.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over there
being Britain?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, go over to the UK.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.665 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
going to finally get

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:90%
some feedback on my target.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I was really shocked to see
these huge massive designs.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you in the
middle of these fields?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
The first one I ever went into
was by Silbury Hill in 1997.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was a fractal so-called
Coke snowflake, six-sided.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That is what I had
studied in my dissertation

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to look at fractal geometry .

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, that
can't be a coincidence.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.292 align:middle line:90%
I studied fractal geometry.

00:12:18.292 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm walking
around in one, but it's

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
the size of a football field.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
When I studied them
in books, George,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:84%
they would save ink by
leaving the center blank.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: And here it
was, 300 feet across.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Really incredible.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
is, people were

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:90%
experiencing really strange.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Feelings.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Energetic feelings.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Feelings.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Energetic feelings.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin
to run into people

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that have had their batteries
and cameras and other.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drained, right?

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Drained, destroyed,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.862 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Burnt out in
seconds of going into these.

00:12:49.862 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to wonder what
in the world is going on here.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:84%
How these huge objects,
they have some sort

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:90%
of energetic signature.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't they also
investigate the crops?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it was a wheat field.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at the
chaff and the wheat

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and there was something
genetically altered about it

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.738 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, I have to say,
a lot of the early science

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in crop circles,
it's not entirely

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
clear what's causing some of
those effects that people saw.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they were effects.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, there definitely
there are some effects.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:90%
You had changes in the plant.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, based on our research,
it's not clear to me

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
whether that is a
result of the energy

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:90%
once the crop circle is there.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.337 align:middle line:84%
Because we did run into
people after a few years,

00:13:31.337 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think people,
initially people could do it.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I did run into people that
could actually make these,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
not in 20 years' time, but
in maybe four or five hours

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.272 align:middle line:84%
with a group of
five, six people.

00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could make it
the same as what you saw?

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, they could.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:90%
They really could.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And these were not hoaxers.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
They were actually really
interested in the phenomena,

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted to
interact with it.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But somebody would
have seen them in the field.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.377 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: No, they
got good, George,

00:13:54.377 --> 00:13:57.692 align:middle line:84%
they got good doing
it in a very hidden.

00:13:57.692 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do it at night?

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yes, they
do it at night.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flashlights?

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.898 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No flashlights.

00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:03.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding me!

00:14:03.023 --> 00:14:05.487 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I went out with them
a couple times just to prove,

00:14:05.487 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think they could do it.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said, do you
want to see us make one?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And these were believers
that the crop circles

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
themselves have weird effects.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
these people believe?

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They believe that
there was some other original

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, like
we're talking about,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that made ones that cannot
be easily explained.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They started
out by making,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:90%
to see, very small ones.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.842 align:middle line:90%
And they got bigger and bigger.

00:14:27.842 --> 00:14:29.383 align:middle line:84%
I said actually we
can make something

00:14:29.383 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:90%
that looks half decent.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.375 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting these
weird effects ourselves

00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
that people have
reported around,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: These strange
electromagnetic effects.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can
change the pattern.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They became like
artists, science artists.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Changing the pattern,
seeing the effects,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:90%
seeing how people react.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So people did come
onto the scene

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and end up making these
really large ones.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But, George, the main point is,
these large ones that they made

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:90%
are also real.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, at least electronically.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.593 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: And energetically.

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really see it
anymore as real versus man-made.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.435 align:middle line:84%
To me, they're all real, because
energetically, they have--.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you mentioned some

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of the technical
failures of people who

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:90%
are in these crop formations.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:90%
You take people on tours.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yes.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around the planet.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: One of the
main things that people

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
have seen over the years
in and around crop circles

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen with our group
almost every year that we've

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
been there since the mid 1990s,
are weird and unexplained

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:90%
camera and battery failures.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
We saw it last year,
we saw the year before,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and we've just seen
it almost every time.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
experience this for yourself,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
because it really shows you
the power and the mystery

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.783 align:middle line:84%
and the magic of
the crop circles.

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe what
other people tell you

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
about the crop circles,
go see it for yourself.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen to be
one of the people who

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.408 align:middle line:84%
has this experience
with the cameras

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and the batteries like so many
other people have experienced,

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
including professional
film crews and so forth,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
it'll be a story, an
experience that you

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
can talk about and tell people
about for a long, long time.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it will be your personal
experience that shows you

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
that this is a real phenomena.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to listen
to anyone else's opinions

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.515 align:middle line:90%
about it after that.

00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If these
are being done,

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Simeon, by outside sources,
and outside sources to me

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
would be extraterrestrial,
or I have

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
another theory I'll
mention in a second, what

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
do you think the message is?

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It's, um--

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
strange designs.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's got
to be a purpose here.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It seems to
me, my idea about it,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:84%
after having been involved
with this for over 20 years,

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're dealing with
intelligence and energy that

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:84%
comes through from other
dimensions of parallel reality,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
one way that that energy
could come through

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.397 align:middle line:84%
would be through
shapes and designs.

00:16:49.397 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And this has been part of
physics for a long time.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You're familiar with the
area called cymatics.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: You know how
sound creates shapes.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: And so forth.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.767 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
probably how they're using

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:90%
these to make what they make.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So these patterns have a
deeper sort of significance

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond the
appearance of it.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we see
these electronic effects.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.645 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like juncturing two
parallel realities together.

00:17:13.645 --> 00:17:14.445 align:middle line:90%
It's like a bridge.

00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: And that bridge occurs
through frequencies and shape.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.358 align:middle line:84%
Because shapes and frequencies
are the language of nature.

00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have another theory.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, of course, we
have heard of the Gaia theory.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Interesting here, we're
working with Gaia.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
That the planet is alive.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's an organism to itself.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
What if the planet
has intelligence

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's trying to communicate
with us via any way it can,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and that would be
crop formations?

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's sending
us these messages

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
from within the planet.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.027 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Oh, yea.

00:17:47.027 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that possible?

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I wouldn't
rule that out either.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, intelligence
can manifest itself

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.947 align:middle line:90%
in so many unexpected ways.

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it's saying,
stop killing me or something

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, nature
has its own language.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And why wouldn't it
eventually use very precise

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:90%
geometric shapes too?

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the
path of least effort.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It doesn't
always just turn

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
into entropy and randomness like
we've been taught from science.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It actually comes highly
ordered structured systems,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.527 align:middle line:90%
and that's one of the messages.

00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
By the way, George,
I have to mention,

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I have talked to witnesses
that have seen UFOs,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:90%
flying disks leave.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.632 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or orbs or
things like that.

00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Leave these patterns.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
The orbs are
associated with it too.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
interesting subject.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's balls of light.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
But I've talked to witnesses.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:90%
It was in "Black Swan Ghost."

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This woman that was
picking huckleberries

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
with her brother and this disk
comes over the forest area

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
up in Usk, Washington
in the '70s.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said when that disk
left, it flattened the plants.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: And I said, did
it just bend them over?

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.925 align:middle line:84%
It kind of went
very low and swoosh.

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:47.725 align:middle line:90%
She said no.

00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:49.017 align:middle line:90%
Flat as a pancake.

00:18:49.017 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:90%
What does that sound like?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
like the formations?

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.833 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, it
wasn't a crop circle,

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
but it left flat as a pancake
wildflowers as it left,

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and then of course,
a couple hours,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the military comes up from
Spokane, wants to interview,

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
what did they see,
did you see anyone.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Takes measurements.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember initial UFO
sightings were landing spots .

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And you would see
the indentation

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of what could be the
tripod or the burn

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:90%
from whatever the source was.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, we got
into the crop formations.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they wanted to
direct us over a period of time

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.328 align:middle line:90%
to tell us they were here.

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That's an
interesting idea, George,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
because how often is it
that people around UFO,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
UFO landing sites also
experience that strange sort

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
of effects on cars, radios.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Same thing
around the crop circles.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely a
type of connection there.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of has that feeling,
right, of a UFO landing site.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: So I would
say that there's

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
some kind of, there's
a connection there,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
there's a connection.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the show,
"Crop Circles, Embrace the

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Mystery" on Gaia,
of course, we talk

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
about the balls of
light people have

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
been reported seeing all
over, as you just mentioned.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:10%
>>COLIN ANDREWS: Many people
have seen, I've seen many times

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:10%
over the years myself,
sometimes on camera,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:10%
we see balls of
light in the sky.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Totally inexplicable movements.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:10%
Nothing that we can rationalize.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:10%
I've been with
government scientists,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:10%
I've been with many
scientists, and we

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:10%
have film from all kinds
of people over the years

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:10%
that clearly demonstrates
one, these things exist.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:10%
They're clearly, there they are.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:10%
So that's what they
can expect to see.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:10%
They can expect to see
very unusual things

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:10%
taking place they will
not be able to explain.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:10%
So the mystique
that brought them

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:10%
is probably how they will leave.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anything unusual
ever happened to you, Simeon,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
investigating this
crop formations?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Sightings yourself?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Anything strange?

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: My main experience
there started out

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
kind of non ordinary
experiences started out

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
with initially just seeing
the cameras lose their ability

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:90%
to focus.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saw that.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I have
with my own camera.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: At a distance.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking, we're talking
maybe a distance of a quarter

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
mile, you're up looking over
one of these crop circles

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and your camera stops focusing.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a quarter
mile away from the formation.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.755 align:middle line:84%
It's happened to people flying
over these and microlights

00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:90%
camera stops working.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I started to
see some crop circle weirdness.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
progressed from there.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.768 align:middle line:84%
Even Colin was with us
once, Colin Andrews,

00:21:30.768 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:90%
as you just showed him talking.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.227 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great investigator.

00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:35.583 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, he was one of
the original investigators.

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:90%
We were with him once.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
He was one of our guests and
his camera stopped working.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it started with
the cameras, batteries.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I was with someone,
they put their camera,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Sony camcorder down in
the middle of the circle.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.228 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:21:48.228 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Melted the soldered
joints on the inside.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's nearly
impossible, right?

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:90%
They said--

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Under any condition.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.267 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's very
hard to explain.

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like all of
the energy in the camcorder

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
discharged at the same
time and melted the,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and Sony sent it back
and said the whole power

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
supply had melted.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.293 align:middle line:90%
They had to replace it.

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't being used,
it was just sitting there.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So we stopped putting
our cameras down

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:90%
on top of crops circles.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the balls of
light too occasionally.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Those, as you mentioned here,
are very interesting phenomena.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.812 align:middle line:84%
That has actually been
studied for a long time.

00:22:18.812 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
the balls of light

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
come in, and then later
when you go to investigate,

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.102 align:middle line:90%
there's a crop formation there.

00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:25.902 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:22:25.902 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Or another scenario
is, that they're

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
attracted to these
areas or something's

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
going out in the physics
of the area that's

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
creating both phenomena
at the same time.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, once
the shape is there,

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
the energetics allow
these balls of light.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
This is ball lightning.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.497 align:middle line:84%
What people don't realize
about ball lightning,

00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
a quantum object.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
junctures directly

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:90%
with the quantum field.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It pulls energy.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fascinating thing.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.442 align:middle line:84%
People have studied
this in the past,

00:22:52.442 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
they call it exotic
vacuum objects, EVOs.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it appear to
be under intelligent control?

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, that's
the thing about it.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:84%
These balls of light,
I'm told by people who've

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
been out there, could
start moving towards you,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:84%
almost have a sense that they
can feel that you're there.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:90%
They seem sort of intelligent.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:10%
It's really interesting.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
What's behind it and how
does it sort of pick up

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
this intentionality?

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are the balls?

00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: The one I saw was
the size of a grapefruit,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:90%
but they can be--

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're very small.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No, they can be bigger.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:90%
They can be a few feet across.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%
And these are the--

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
still small to me.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.852 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, they're
bright though.

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
They may be small, but they
generate a lot of energy.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're round?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, generally.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
People have been seeing
these for a long time.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm convinced that
these balls of light people

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:10%
see around crop circles
are the same thing

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:10%
that people have been seeing
that we called ball lightning.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they disappear?

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
When they're gone,
what did they do?

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Just vanish?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Or do they take off?

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Either.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be either situation.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:90%
They can just kind of blink out.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The one I saw was there
and then it just vanished.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:10%
They can move at
really rapid speeds

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.812 align:middle line:10%
and they can be a
really small object,

00:24:04.812 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:10%
they can be a larger
object, but it still

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:10%
seems to be the same phenomena.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:10%
It's some sort of electrized
charge cluster, it's a charge,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:10%
it's kind of, it's a
concentrated area of energy.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does this
affect you personally knowing

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:84%
what you know about some of
these very unusual things?

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: Well, you
know, you learn

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.090 align:middle line:10%
that there is a lot of
really important information

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:10%
that we're really not
talking about in science.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: That have
evidence for them,

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:10%
and that the skepticism
that we all naturally have,

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:10%
it's gone too far in the
direction of not even looking

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.590 align:middle line:10%
at these phenomena,
taking them seriously.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But we've had 100
years of getting

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to the edge of these
sort of subject matter.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
But we always pull back.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you realize, is when
you get a hunch and intuition,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
you see something
that doesn't fit

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
in the description of reality
that we've been taught

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is ordinary by our society,
you should pursue it.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
You should be looking
at that and wondering,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.223 align:middle line:84%
is there some sort
of opportunity

00:25:09.223 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
there, something
important, right?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead of worrying
about what other people

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
think about you, worrying about
the giggle factor and so forth.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:10%
Whatever your experience
is, you should

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:10%
be looking at this,
because it might

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:10%
be the tip of a very
important iceberg that

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:10%
could have very important
consequences for everyone.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During
World War II, we had

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:90%
people who decoded messages.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
That was their job,
that's what they did.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody trying to decode
these crop formations

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.078 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure out
what the heck they mean?

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, there
have been people.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:84%
People have discovered all sorts
of interesting information.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:90%
There are the mathematics of it.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, because they're very
symmetrical and precise shapes,

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.622 align:middle line:84%
a lot like crystalline
shapes often.

00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:50.422 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:50.422 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: You can look at the
fractal dimension of them.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the sort
of winding spiral patterns

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
within them and kind of,
people have looked at them

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
in a variety of ways
and there's always

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.863 align:middle line:84%
a lot of math at the basis
of it at the end of the day.

00:26:05.863 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But the important
thing is, people

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
seem to discover new
mathematical ideas that

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:90%
are very surprising.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But it just shows us, at
the basis of our reality,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.608 align:middle line:84%
there's often a lot of
mathematical precision to it.

00:26:18.608 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see that in
the crop circles.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
You see it in a
lot of phenomena.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
your gut tell you?

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think's happening?

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:29.152 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: My gut tells me
that the conversations

00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that we should have been having
in physics for the last 100

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:84%
years, we're going to have
those conversations now.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Because.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By necessity.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Science, formal
science, and I've

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:90%
been reading "Science" magazine.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.258 align:middle line:84%
Every issue for 30 years
since my graduate advisor

00:26:42.258 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:84%
told me to get a
subscription to "Science."

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't see a lot of discussion
about these phenomena

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.903 align:middle line:90%
in "Science" magazine.

00:26:47.903 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It always concerns me.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Occasionally,
once a decade, you'll

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:90%
have a letter about UFOs.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think it
would be a front cover story.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: You would think.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
different topics,

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:84%
including things
like cold fusion,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:84%
exotic energy sources, which
we should be looking at.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.052 align:middle line:84%
But there's such a
huge institutional bias

00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
against studying things that
are out of the ordinary,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
right, that discourages new
researchers from going off

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:84%
into areas that are
not considered safe.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.832 align:middle line:84%
It could be a threat
to your career.

00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So people are always playing
it safe and we're not looking.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't
had the discussion

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:84%
in physics about
what even quantum

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, what is going
on with quantum mechanics.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
How can things be described
both as particles and waves?

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And we've been told
that it only describes

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:90%
really small particles, right?

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't it describe
larger objects like us?

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.142 align:middle line:84%
Why do we say that this kind
of magical and strange thing

00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that we call quantum
mechanics only

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%
applies to subatomic matter?

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We're made of subatomic
matter, George.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.678 align:middle line:84%
My gut feeling is, we should
be looking at these topics

00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:90%
and we should be studying them.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like the government
funded remote viewing,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
it should be funding
research into these areas,

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's important.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're 13 and 1/2
billion years old here,

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
We're made up of, as people
said, we're made of star stuff.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.582 align:middle line:84%
We're made of the
same quantum elements

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that make the universe.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
What's the connection?

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And why do we see some of
this really exotic phenomena,

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, teleportation kind of
this interaction at a distance,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:84%
why don't we see that at a
larger macroscopic scale too?

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And we haven't actually
talked about that very much.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:84%
People who have investigated
this within physics

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.937 align:middle line:84%
have always been really
reprimanded for it.

00:28:30.937 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:10%
They've had their careers
really hurt by it.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, they have.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, George,
that these phenomena

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about here, these

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:84%
are actually examples of how
quantum phenomena manifest

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:90%
themselves at our scale.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Privately, what are
scientists saying about crop

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:90%
formations, privately?

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: So scientists,
I talk to them,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me things
privately , like you're saying,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.150 align:middle line:84%
which they don't want
me to ever repeat.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
For either it's classified.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of what
people are going to.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Career.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Career.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
people don't have

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
to worry about their
careers anymore, George.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for a long time.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They're tops in their
field and they tell,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
they know about these
exotic phenomena.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:90%
They know about this stuff.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have even
handled pieces of crashed UFOs.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And, George--

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: They've handled it.

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
When I tell them some of these
crop circles could be man-made,

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.970 align:middle line:84%
they come back at me about the
reality of the UFO phenomena,

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.445 align:middle line:84%
because they told me they've
handled the stuff themselves.

00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And everyone would know
who these people are.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But publicly.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.663 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No, exactly.

00:29:35.663 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't say it.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Nope.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.435 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
me to mention it.

00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:40.405 align:middle line:90%
No YouTube videos.

00:29:40.405 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So how many people
are out there,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.690 align:middle line:84%
George, that know exactly what
you and I are talking about

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and the audience
knows about this too,

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't
come forward to lend

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
their support behind it
because they're concerned

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:90%
about the consequences?

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
When those people
start to come forward,

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
some real changes.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: I'm telling you.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
possibility, Simeon,

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that whatever
happened is happening

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:90%
through a parallel universe?

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
That we're having
an overlap somehow.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.123 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:30:04.123 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, George, I
think that's the most likely

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
explanation at this
point, of what.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: All of
these phenomena are.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:84%
This has been proposed since
Paul Dirac proposed the idea

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.435 align:middle line:90%
of antimatter back in 1927.

00:30:16.435 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
we have a guest,

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
by the way, David Paulides,
who talks about missing people.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And he can't explain
what's going on.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:90%
These kids aren't being taken.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
These people aren't just
disappearing by some animal

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:90%
coming down and grabbing them.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think they're stumbling into
some portal of another universe

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and they can't find
their way back.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, that
definitely could be the case.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
that's what's happening

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
with these formations.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: People, yes.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
People have proposed
since the '20s

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a mirror
universe, mirror particles,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:90%
ghost universes.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And every time they do
it, the physics community

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.572 align:middle line:84%
has this big backlash and
tells them to get lost.

00:30:55.572 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the phrase,
shut up and calculate.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: You can't talk about
what's really going on here.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think the most likely
explanation for these phenomena

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is certain things that you
do, lead you get bleed-through

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:90%
from other parallel realities.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:10%
The parallel reality idea is
being taken very seriously

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:10%
by some scientists.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:10%
There are experiments going
on at Oak Ridge National Labs

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:10%
in Tennessee.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we speak.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Looking at mirror
neutrons, a mirror universe.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard about this
experiment in Antarctica,

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:84%
the ANITA experiment,
where they detected

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
what seemed to be a neutrino
going backwards in time.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.398 align:middle line:84%
The main point is,
we don't know what

00:31:30.398 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the final results of
these studies will be,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but at least scientists,
serious scientists

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.022 align:middle line:84%
are looking at the possibility
of parallel realities.

00:31:37.022 --> 00:31:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So when you and I
experience things

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
every day or occasionally
that we can't quite explain,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.633 align:middle line:84%
you have to wonder whether
it's sort of popping in

00:31:42.633 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:90%
from another reality.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We can't physically
see dark matter.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.795 align:middle line:84%
We can't actually see
it, we can't feel it,

00:31:48.795 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
but it has a gravitational
influence, and a lot of people

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
speculate that that's
another parallel reality.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physicist
Dr. Theresa Bullard

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:84%
on our program, "Mystery
Teachings," talked exactly

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD: We've learned
that string theory provides

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:10%
some exciting and beautiful
possibilities for discovering

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:10%
a unified theory of everything.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.940 align:middle line:10%
And string theory is
what has opened the door

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:10%
to the multiverse
idea in science.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.050 align:middle line:10%
How did it do that?

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, it goes back to the
issue that string theorists are

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:10%
grappling with, the challenge of
identifying the exact geometry

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:10%
of the super strings
and extra dimensions

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:10%
hidden within our universe.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:10%
They have many candidate
shapes allowed by the math.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Over 10 to the power
500 possibilities,

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:10%
which is a massive number.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:10%
Each geometry
theoretically corresponding

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:10%
to its own universe
with a different set

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:10%
of physical laws and tuning.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:10%
But rather than saying there
can be only one right answer,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:10%
resulting in only one
universe, namely ours,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:10%
string theorists
have instead proposed

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:10%
that all of these possibilities
are equally probable

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and likely exist somewhere
within a multiverse.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:10%
Meaning there are at least 10 to
the power 500 differently tuned

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:10%
universes out there in
the multiverse, maybe even

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:10%
infinite numbers.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.570 align:middle line:10%
But this part where they say
they're all equally probable

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:19.710 align:middle line:10%
and all exist, this is the
part where some scientists then

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:10%
claim that this
means that there is

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.290 align:middle line:10%
nothing special about the
fine tuning of our universe.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:10%
We simply find these sets of
parameters in our universe

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:10%
because we can only
exist in a universe that

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:10%
is fine tuned for life.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:10%
But there are many other types
of universes in the multiverse.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:10%
We are just one possibility
in an infinite sea, nothing

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:10%
special.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, mystery solved.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:10%
Or not.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Really, all of this
is speculation based

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:10%
on assumptions, not evidence.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You agree
with that, Simeon?

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.037 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, overall.

00:33:52.037 --> 00:33:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What she says?

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: The science suggests,
at least just coming from it

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.500 align:middle line:10%
mathematically, like
string theory does,

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:10%
that there are lots
of parallel realities.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And whether you get from string
theory or from cosmology,

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.538 align:middle line:84%
they all point in this
direction of there

00:34:06.538 --> 00:34:07.580 align:middle line:90%
being parallel realities.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's so much
we haven't discovered yet,

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:90%
isn't there?

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at, there is
so much we haven't uncovered.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.297 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the history
of where we've been

00:34:15.297 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and where we are
now, we've always

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
found the idea of a larger
universe a little bit

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:90%
frightening, hard to believe.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.110 align:middle line:84%
People dealt with
this 500 years ago.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:84%
You think of Copernicus,
Galileo just even suggesting

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.373 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth wasn't
the center, right,

00:34:31.373 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
as your guest is
pointing out here

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.260 align:middle line:90%
that maybe we're not special.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:90%
That was like heresy back then.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:90%
People were burned at the stake.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:10%
And now every day they
discover new exoplanets, right?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:84%
So would it really
be surprising we're

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
finding our universe
is infinitely large,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:90%
there's also other universes?

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will technology help
us find these other universes?

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.872 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: I think it will.

00:34:52.872 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:84%
These particle
experiments that are

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:84%
being done right now that we
talked about a second ago,

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.725 align:middle line:84%
you could find evidence
from particle physics.

00:34:59.725 --> 00:35:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Something, that
something doesn't quite

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:84%
fit from our conventional
model of physics,

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and that the only
way to explain it

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
would be that there's
some other reality

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see that's sort
of interacting with our own.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:10%
In fact, physicists
right now are

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:10%
proposing something called, the
Many Interacting Worlds model.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Howard Wiseman from Australia,
serious mainstream physicists

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
have said, you know, you
can take quantum mechanics,

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:84%
flip it around and look
at quantum mechanics

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:84%
as an effect of
multiverses interacting.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That's it's a huge
number, near infinite number of

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.122 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Multi, they
interact slightly

00:35:34.122 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
with us, which creates what
we call quantum mechanics.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So physicists are
really starting

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
to look at this flip it around.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.768 align:middle line:84%
And so you could end
up at multiverses

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:90%
from many different ways.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.143 align:middle line:90%
And it wouldn't seem so strange.

00:35:44.143 --> 00:35:47.078 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, 500 years ago
we would have really thought

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was weird that we
weren't the center, you know.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.912 align:middle line:84%
That it's a couple
of planets and us.

00:35:50.912 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:90%
And now how big is it?

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is antimatter?

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Antimatter is
something that Paul Dirac,

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:84%
the British physicist,
proposed back in 1927.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't believe it.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '27?

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.623 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: '27.

00:36:05.623 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.207 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: He was going through the
equations of quantum mechanics,

00:36:09.207 --> 00:36:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and he found that there was a
parallel set of explanations

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that suggested particles
that we hadn't detected yet,

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that fit Einstein's equations.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.178 align:middle line:10%
And he called it, I don't know
if he called it antimatter back

00:36:23.178 --> 00:36:25.470 align:middle line:10%
then, but he suggested that
there were other particles.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And it took three years
to work the math out.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.265 align:middle line:84%
And then someone named
Carl Anderson actually

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:84%
detected one of these particles
like we're talking about,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:90%
science comes along, in 1932.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at
particle, particle tracks.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 88 years ago.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 88 years ago!

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: 88 years.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.452 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that the math
had suggested ant-particles.

00:36:47.452 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something was there.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: They were.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:90%
They detected them.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And now antimatter, something
that would have seemed

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
like something out
of "Star Trek."

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
George, you realize
that thunderstorms

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:90%
produce antimatter?

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.393 align:middle line:84%
From what I read,
500 times a day.

00:37:00.393 --> 00:37:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: 500 times a day
on the planet antimatter's

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.670 align:middle line:10%
produced by thunderstorms.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where does it go?

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: That's the
thing about antimatter.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
When it encounters matter,
becomes a lot of energy.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Other people
have proposed this.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize winners,
Yang and Lee,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that were looking at something
called symmetries and parity

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.470 align:middle line:84%
violation physics,
particles, they

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:84%
called this a hidden
sector, because we

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find any right-handed
neutrinos in our world.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think will
be the most amazing discovery

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in the next five to 10 years?

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: I think
it's likely to be

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:10%
that there is intelligent life
within the space we're already

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:10%
in now.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Not even extraterrestrial.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:10%
That the space that we're in now
that we think of as being very

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:10%
physical, easy to describe,
is going to be seen as more

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:10%
complex, and that there's other
things going on in these spaces

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:10%
that we've taken for granted .

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The other intelligence,
other life,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.965 align:middle line:84%
other activity that in the past,
we wouldn't have even imagined,

00:38:11.965 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:90%
that it's right here.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.423 align:middle line:84%
It's been here the
whole time, we just

00:38:14.423 --> 00:38:15.882 align:middle line:90%
weren't paying attention.

00:38:15.882 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Simeon, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Thanks a lot, George.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe one day we'll get
the answers to crop formations,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:10%
parallel universes.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we
merely can just explore.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:90%
