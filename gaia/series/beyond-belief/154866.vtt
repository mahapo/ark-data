00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Over the years, we have talked
about one world government,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:10%
the new world order,
globalization.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
And that is our subject tonight
with Patrick Wood, author

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
of "Technocracy Rising,"
an incredible story

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:10%
about what they want
to do with us, Patrick.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:10%
>>PATRICK WOOD: More likely what
they are doing to us right now.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
begin studying this?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well I got
associated with a man

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Antony C.
Sutton back in 1977, late 1977.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:10%
And he had just been released
from the Hoover Institution

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:10%
at Stanford University.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
He was a scholar, a writer,
a very well-known person

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had been tracking the
Trilateral Commission, as I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:90%
had, from a different angle.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But we met kind of by chance
in New Orleans one time

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
on a conference we
were speaking at.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that
we had a huge story

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that we were sitting on, the
formation of this organization

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
called the Trilateral
Commission and what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
they had done to capture
the Carter administration.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Carter,
Walter Mondale, they

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
were both members of the
Trilateral Commission

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and then they proceeded
to stuff the cabinet

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:90%
with members of the commission.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We were very concerned,
like what is this?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And so Sutton and
I began to write

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
a newsletter called
Trilateral Observer

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and that became the
basis for our books,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
"Trilaterals Over Washington."

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And so over the years, our
research matured, I guess.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And Sutton passed in
2002, unfortunately.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to pick up
the research trail again,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.819 align:middle line:84%
I ran across historic
technocracy from the 1930s.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard of it before.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And explain
what technocracy means.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well,
technocracy in the 1930s

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
was a movement that
started in earnest

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
at Columbia University, of
all places, in New York City.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And Columbia brought these
engineers and scientists

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
in to discuss creating a
new economic model that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 align:middle line:84%
would replace capitalism
and free enterprise.

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
This was during the
Great Depression.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.545 align:middle line:90%
It was a depressing time, right?

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And they needed change.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they figured
they needed change.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of rose
up and said, well, it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
going to be we and
only we who can

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
create this economic system.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So they called it
technocracy and it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
was to be based on
scientists and engineers

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:90%
running everything directly.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
No political process,
no Congress--

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dangerous.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --just basically
them doing everything

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
according to their
scientific model, right?

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I equated pretty quickly
this technocracy movement

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
with what the Trilateral
Commission wanted to do.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see this in
the '70s, but I saw it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
once I discovered
historic technocracy.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:10%
The connection between
the two is first

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:10%
that the Trilateral
Commission initially

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:10%
said all over its
literature that they

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.019 align:middle line:10%
wanted to create a new
international economic order.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:10%
That was their statement.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.185 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That was the goal.

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: That was the goal.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1974, the United
Nations passed a resolution

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
at their General
Assembly that called

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of a new
international economic order.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Now you question,
OK, what does new mean?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of back to
the old Clinton days,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
what does "is" mean--

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%
what does "new" mean?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know in the '70s
what that really meant.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:90%
But now I look back--

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
my background is economics, of
course, and so is Sutton's--

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I look back across
the economic history

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:84%
going back even
thousands of years.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
There has never once been an
alternative economic system

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
devised that would replace
the system of free barter.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Only technocracy is the only
one that you see looking back

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
in history that
specifically said

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to create
a new economic system

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and it was going to be based
on resources instead of supply

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and demand and free trade
between people and so on.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be a
resource-based system where

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
they would control
both the resources

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and the products that
would be produced from it.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
became ultimately

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
we see this in expression
today in programs

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
like sustainable development
that the United Nations has.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:10%
They also call it a
new economic system.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so is it workable?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: In my opinion, no.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It will never work.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
This is my opinion after
having looked at it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
traditional economics.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It will not work in the
end, but they think it will.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have the United
Nations pushing it now

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%
to 193 nations around the world.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:90%
They've all signed onto it.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks about
sustainable development today.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The key here that's
really hard to understand

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is sustainable
development, which

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is technocracy warmed
over from the '30s,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
technocracy is an economic
system, not a political system.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
These people hate politicians.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
They have no use for
politicians whatsoever.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, not
many people do.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, we have these
complaints today, too,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.421 align:middle line:84%
that our politicians
start listening to us.

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter whether
you're Republican or Democrat,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:90%
everybody says the same thing.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We've lost control,
we're out of control.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth column
that's marching right now

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
are these scientists
and engineers

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
who have quietly
crept in and said,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
look, you need to
let us run society;

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
you need to let us do
what is just right;

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the science is
settled, after all.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We've figured it out,
we've got the PhDs.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What form of
government, Patrick,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
would that be if they had to
change into their own belief

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It would be a direct
autocracy where things would

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
be controlled directly
by the scientists

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and engineers with
no interference

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:90%
from the people whatsoever.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that dangerous?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It is dangerous.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.057 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thinking of this
group of actors, if you will.

00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not political
actors because you typically

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
don't find them in politics.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they think
life would be better for us

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:90%
under this kind of rule?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is still a
little bit of a mystery on how

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
a fellow human being who has
to take a shower in the morning

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
just like you and I do
and put his pants on--

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.359 align:middle line:84%
well, there's women, too,
involved but it was probably

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:90%
more kind of a male-dominated--

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wear
pants now, too.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of odd
that fellow human beings

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:84%
would rise to a point where
they say that they can instruct

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
all the rest of the
human beings on Earth

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%
to do what they think is right.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.366 align:middle line:84%
But to a technocrat
mind, apparently they

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have any
problem with this.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
They figure, well, it's
a cut and dried solution.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Science is what science is.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And if the scientific
consensus is

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
that we should all march
left or right or whatever,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
then that's just the
way it needs to be.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:90%
So what's to discuss?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it communist?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not communist.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.986 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: This is interesting.

00:07:22.986 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
This is difficult to
wrap one's head around.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of similarities.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.327 align:middle line:84%
Communism is
autocratic, it's very

00:07:29.327 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
dictatorial in that sense--
somebody's going to tell you

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
what to do, micromanagement.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But technocracy back in the
'30s and the communist movement

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
back then, which was
pretty prominent too,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:90%
they hated each other's guts.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They absolutely had no
toleration for each other.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The communists wrote
against the technocrats

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
as just being all screwed
up and the technocrats said,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
don't ever call us a communist.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And some people did.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Back then they said,
don't call us communists.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:90%
We're nothing like communism.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason is simple
and is kind of basic.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Communism is a political
system based on Marxism.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Technocracy is not a
political system at all;

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:90%
it's an economic system.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So they felt like, we have
nothing to do with communism.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not a political system,
we don't use the politicians,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Politicians are not to
represent the people.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The people don't basically
need representation.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
We have figured out what
will make them happy

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and what they should
do and we will simply

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:90%
tell everybody what to do.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
just going to do it.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:90%
They never explained how.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They never explained why
people would go along

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:90%
with the program.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, it
was really kind of nutsy

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and you wonder how did it--

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:84%
it was rejected in
America, by the way,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the 1930s pretty
much, but it's coming back.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that these
glaring deficiencies have never

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
been explained.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the North American
technate that they predicted--

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that's what they modeled their
whole thing after in the 1930s.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They had this map of the United
States, Canada, Mexico, Central

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
America, the top part
of South America.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.144 align:middle line:84%
All that was going to be
the giant technate that

00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
was going to be managed by
scientists and engineers.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They never said how
are they going to get

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.855 align:middle line:90%
Canada to go along with this?

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
How are they going
to get Mexico?

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't just draw
a map and say, do it.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.219 align:middle line:84%
But they had no
problem with that.

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
They figured, well,
of course they're

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:90%
going to go along with it.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:90%
We have devised it.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Like why wouldn't--

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the
world be like, Patrick,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.127 align:middle line:90%
under technocracy?

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Muslim world,
power is held by politicians

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and business people who work
together to maintain the status

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
quo so that politicians retain
power and plutocrats retain

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:90%
wealth.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:84%
They do this in plain sight, but
it doesn't have to be this way.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of different
power structures, many of which

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
are proven to work
throughout its history,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
although one of the most
interesting alternatives

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:90%
is entirely theoretical.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
In a technocracy, power is
still held by an elite--

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
not an elite of plutocrats,
not an elite of aristocrats,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
but an elite of
technocrats, experts

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:90%
in science and technology.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The government would be run by
engineers and scientists who

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
can apply the scientific method
to solve real world issues.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead of electing
career politicians,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
a small group of intellectuals
would be chosen to lead us.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They would focus on efficiency,
what practically works,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and the concept of morality
may become obsolete.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's that detail
which has people worried.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The claim that technocracy
can replace morality,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
it makes technocracy sound
more like Orwell's nightmare

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:90%
of a-realistic system.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't know for sure because
no such system has ever

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
been established,
but there have been

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
attempts to establish
a technocracy and many

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
still advocate for it today.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure
I'd like that, Patrick.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: A lot of
people don't like it.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days,
you could go to any car

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
dealer in the country and order
a technocracy gray automobile

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
like they were
driving in that video.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
They had over 500,000
card-carrying, dues-paying

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
members back in those days.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.559 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of people.

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.391 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so and
the fact that you

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
could buy a technocracy gray
car if you were technocrat,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
it would come with the logo on
the side and the orange steel

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:90%
wheels.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It was crazy back then and
it's just as crazy today.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what bothers
me about this system

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
is they said no elected
officials anymore.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.019 align:middle line:84%
Who would appoint them
to be judge and jury?

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They would be
self-appointed, ostensibly.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's dangerous.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Of course
it's dangerous.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very dangerous.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They envision
a continental board

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that would itself elect a
supreme director, if you will,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But they would all be comprised
of engineers and scientists.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It would look like an org
chart of a modern corporation,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But they had a board of
directors over the whole thing

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.619 align:middle line:90%
and then they had various--

00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
what did they call them--

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
social functions like military
and manufacturing and so on.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
They had a hierarchy that didn't
include any representation

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:90%
of the people at all.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was just going
to be basic dictation.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
this be implemented?

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's
being implemented by--

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say
back in the 1930s,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:90%
they wrote down requirements.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.283 align:middle line:84%
Engineers are good at that,
you have to hand it to them.

00:12:23.283 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They wrote down requirements
for us to look at today.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Part of the requirements
involved controlling energy,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to control the
production and consumption

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So today we see smart grid being
implemented around the world,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
we see--

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Smart meters.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We see smart meters,
we see cap and trade schemes

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm convinced, Patrick,
with that kind of a system

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
they would say, let's say
it's 100 degrees in St. Louis

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and you want to run your
air conditioner at 72,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
they would bop it back up to
80 and say, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We're running your air
conditioner at 80 degrees.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And they would control
it in every house.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's exactly
what they're pushing for.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but they can
extract data from your house

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
as to your habits, as
to what you are doing

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:90%
in any given part of the day.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Every electronic
device in your home

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
has an electronic
signature, whether it's

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
a motor or a wi-fi
router, whatever.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It has an electronic
signature that

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.089 align:middle line:84%
can be identified what
these smart meters so they

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what's
going on in your house.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.463 align:middle line:84%
They know when you're
taking a shower,

00:13:30.463 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
they know when
you're watching TV,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
they know when you're
computing because they

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:90%
can see the traffic--

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They know what
you're watching on television.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.948 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They know what you're
watching on television.

00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:42.805 align:middle line:84%
This is collecting data that
can be used to manipulate

00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:44.034 align:middle line:90%
and control people.

00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know if
you built a factory

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that you'd have to
build in a monitoring

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:90%
system for the factory.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.392 align:middle line:84%
Because how would you know
what to do if something broke?

00:13:52.392 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
You just don't wait for the
whole factory to blow up,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:90%
you put a monitoring system in.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, the technocrat fifth
column, as I call it,

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:10%
has been busy creating this
monitoring/infrastructure

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:10%
system that can extract
data from all of society

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:10%
in order to manage the system.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
This is why we see the smart
grid movement, for instance.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.939 align:middle line:84%
This only started back
in 2009, by the way.

00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
fact that we would

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
lose as people the ability
to try to somewhat control

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:90%
our destiny.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But is that a bad thing
if they step in and make

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
things functional and
smooth and they work?

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We have always
needed experts in government,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:90%
let's face it.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:84%
We like to know when we flush
the toilet that the sewer

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
system is going to work
in our town, right?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want it to back up.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So you don't appoint
the dog catcher

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to be the in charge
of the sewage system.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
people that understand

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
how to make things
function, but you always

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
want to have that under the
control of representatives

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what a constitutional
republic is all about,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
is representation and
having the people involved

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and the political process
decide what you want to do.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you want a sewer system?

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, yes we do.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, we want one.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll authorize
one and we'll

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%
find somebody good to run it.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to wipe
away the political system

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and just let the
experts run everything.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because what happens
if that expert decides they want

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:90%
something for personal gain?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or something, and
they control it that way.

00:15:34.627 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If I said this
is a brave new world,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.793 align:middle line:90%
I know you would probably agree.

00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We hear that phrase
all the time.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
When something spooky happens
like the NSA gets caught

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
spying on 50 million
Americans, ooh, it's

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
a brave new world, right?

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, "Brave New World" was
written by Aldous Huxley,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%
He was a Brit.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.801 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago.

00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: A long
time ago, in 1932,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
the same year that technocracy
was at Columbia University.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
He looked across the pond,
saw a social movement

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that was going on here
called technocracy,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and used that as the inspiration
to write his book, "Brave New

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:90%
World."

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this for control,
is that what it's all about?

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Absolutely.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely it is for control.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
United Nations today,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.582 align:middle line:84%
I'm making the connection
between technocracy

00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and the United Nations.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.722 align:middle line:84%
It got fed to the
UN by the members

00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:90%
of the Trilateral Commission.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they fell for it.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: A long time ago.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They fell for it hook,
line, and sinker.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the United Nations

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
today about things they're doing
with agenda 21, agenda 2030,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.904 align:middle line:84%
with the biodiversity treaty
that was signed back in '92,

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you look at these things
and say, what do they

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:90%
expect of humanity?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's all this list of
things that humanity should do.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The biodiversity
treaty, for instance,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
said things like golf
courses are not sustainable.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So they consume
too many resources

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're not worth
the pleasure value.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
cattle are not sustainable

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:90%
because they fart too much--

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:90%
too much methane.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And UCLA just recently
said that your pets--

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:90%
your dog and your cat--

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.297 align:middle line:84%
they're not sustainable either
because they produce too much--

00:17:19.297 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too much methane.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.254 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:17:21.254 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so we've got to
cut down on that.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do away with
Fido and your kitty.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So you look at all these
dictates and you say,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:90%
are these people mad?

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has been just
fine for thousands of years

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and we've gotten along and
things haven't fallen apart.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But now this superclass of
engineers and scientists have

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
risen up to tell us what
we can or cannot do.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I want to
have a pet and I

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
want to have a 50-pound
or a 100-pound dog,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:90%
that's my business.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your business.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's not
their business.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the technocrats
behind the Paris Climate

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Control Accord?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.202 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Absolutely.

00:17:59.202 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
big scheme of things--

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm admittedly
big picture person,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I always try and look at
the biggest picture I can--

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
climate change was created
as the scare tactic

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.449 align:middle line:84%
to scare people into
sustainable development.

00:18:16.449 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It was done by the same people.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It was done back in the
'90s and the roots of it

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:90%
is traced very easily.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And climate change
is nothing in itself,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:90%
but it creates the fear.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And the only solution
that's being offered

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
by the people saying
climate change,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that's the United
Nations mostly,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
is sustainable development.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They say in order to
solve climate change,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
you must accept
sustainable development.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't say, well,
you have choice A

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.522 align:middle line:90%
and choice B. It's just no.

00:18:46.522 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
give you that choice.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.896 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They don't
give you that choice.

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Only choice A. This is the
famous old good cop, bad cop

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
routine, right, where one
guy comes in and beats you up

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and in the interview
room and the other guy--

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scares the
heck out of you.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --says oh, we
can make you a deal.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it
for a long enough time,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:90%
this becomes so thin.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
People like Al Gore
running around saying

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that climate change is
going to kill us all

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and that the ice caps
are going to melt

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and the oceans are
going to rise--

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The shorelines
will be gone.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He's been
saying this for so

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
long and every
prediction he's missed.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And people around the world
now are looking at Al Gore

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying,
are you kidding me?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.065 align:middle line:84%
That old geezer's still around
and the same old stuff he

00:19:34.065 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
was saying 15 or 20 years ago?

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like, give me a break.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.435 align:middle line:84%
This just isn't going
to wash anymore.

00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So the paradigm is wearing thin
with global warming right now.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do the technocrats,
Patrick, feel about new energy

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:90%
sources and things?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a believer
that oil is not a fossil fuel

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
but that it's part
of this planet.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So I just believe it.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in the
Peak oil theory at all.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
it's fossil fuels.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not plants and dinosaurs.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
We'd be out of it by now.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
How do the technocrats feel
about those kinds of resources?

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Interesting
you mentioned peak oil,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because the co-founder
of technocracy

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
incorporated originally was M.
King Hubbert, the later founder

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.905 align:middle line:90%
in 1954 of Peak oil theory.

00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So he was in on it from
the beginning, right.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:84%
He actually wrote the
technocracy study course

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
in 1934, which is
still available.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:90%
You can scan--

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I knew they
didn't like technocracy.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: There's a reason.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But this idea of
energy control runs

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
very deep within
the technocrat mind.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The reason is,
among other things,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
energy is at the root

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of all economic activity.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And it really is, even if it--

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It literally
fuels economic activity.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't do anything
without energy.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.898 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, if I
don't have electricity,

00:20:57.898 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I still have my body.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm one manpower.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm a farmer and I have
a horse, I have a horsepower.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:90%
One horsepower.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One horsepower.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So energy
truly is at the root

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
of all economic activity.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But they believed that they had
to control the output of energy

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to control
economic output.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
That makes logical sense if you
just think about it a minute.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Somebody could have a lever to
control the amount of energy

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:90%
that's in the economic system.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
You would control the
economic output precisely

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and exactly every time
you moved the lever.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at the
search for more and more oil

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.864 align:middle line:90%
and more sophisticated systems.

00:21:40.864 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:10%
>>PARAG KHANNA:
Here are just some

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:10%
of the pipeline projections
and possibilities and scenarios

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:10%
and routes that are
being mapped out

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.284 align:middle line:10%
for the next several decades,
a great deal of them.

00:21:50.284 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:10%
For a number of countries
in this part of the world,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:10%
having pipelines is
the ticket to becoming

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:10%
part of the global
economy and for having

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:10%
some meaning besides the
borders that they are not

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:10%
loyal to themselves.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:10%
Just take Azerbaijan.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Azerbaijan was a forgotten
corner of the Caucasus,

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but now with the Baku
Tblisi pipeline into Turkey,

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
it has rebranded itself as
the frontier of the West.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Then there's Turkmenistan,
which most people think

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:90%
of as a frozen basketcase.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But now it's contributing
gas across the Caspian Sea

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to provide for Europe
and even potentially

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
a Turkmen, Afghan, Pakistan,
India pipeline as well.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:10%
Then there's Kazakhstan,
which didn't even

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:10%
have a name before, it was
more considered South Siberia

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:10%
during the Soviet Union.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, most people recognize
Kazakhstan as an emerging

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:90%
geopolitical player.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's shrewdly
designed pipelines

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
to flow across the Caspian
north through Russia

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:90%
and even east to China.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
More pipelines means
more Silk Roads

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
instead of the great game.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
The great game connotes
dominance of one

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.905 align:middle line:90%
over the other.

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
The Silk Road connotes
independence and mutual trust.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The more pipelines we have,
the more Silk Roads we'll have,

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and the less of a dominant
great game competition

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:90%
will have in the 21st century.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that was,
Patrick, from a Ted talk.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:84%
The more pipelines,
the more control.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The control over energy
has been a policy

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen since
the early 1970s,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
by the way, when the Trilateral
Commission kind of rose

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in power and influence.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:84%
We saw the energy crisis
back in 1973, you remember,

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
where there were lines
around blocks waiting

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:90%
to get gasoline and so on.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:90%
It was a horrible time.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: From that day
forward, the existing energy,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:84%
we have been told, is vastly
limited and that it needs to be

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
controlled and metered and
allocated fairly to the world

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the prices, of
course, kept at a nice level.

00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: With the prices
kept up at a nice high level

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
so that they can manipulate
behavior and make

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:90%
nice profits, too.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have all the
alternative energy sources

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:84%
today like wind power
and solar power.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not categorically
against those things,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
If you've got the money and you
want to buy them and do them,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%
fine.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a free country--

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
well, it should be.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of controlling
energy and saying

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:84%
that while energy
is scarce, we just

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough to go around
and we have to really monitor

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
it, we have to monitor every
little thing that you do.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
We need to know those things.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Are you using too much
according to our scale

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:90%
or too little or whatever?

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Controlling energy is the
reason that fossil fuels,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:90%
if you'd call them that--

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:84%
oil and gas and
natural gas and so on--

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
why they have been declared
an evil, evil, evil source

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't use those
even though we have enough

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.495 align:middle line:84%
to last for at least
200 years with current--

00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe longer.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --with just current
known reserves, right?

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
So they say, oh, that's evil.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to kill that,
we have to kill coal,

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
we have to cut down
on these things.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we need to use all these
other alternative energy

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a scheme to
control economic activity--

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And profit.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And profit.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Parag Khanna, who

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
was just on this video, Dr.
Parag Khanna from Singapore,

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
actually, he's a
professor at the Yew

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:90%
School for Public Policy.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of the leading
technocrats in the world today.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's really
pushing it, isn't he?

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: He is.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book in January
of this year, 2017,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:90%
called "Technocracy in America."

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a little yellow book.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it was
produced very well,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
but he's a global scholar
and they love him.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
He's on a "Fortune"
list of like the 70 most

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:90%
powerful people in the world.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.666 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Influential
people in the world.

00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The guy is a rising
star in every way.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"Technocracy in America."

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
This confirmed and validated
my research in spades.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you
were years ahead.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, I saw it coming.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And he just merely put the stamp
on it, right, the rubber stamp.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But in his book, he said
democracy is broken.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
He called for direct
technocracy in America.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Other recommendations
he makes in his book,

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.933 align:middle line:90%
dismiss the Senate--

00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Gone.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Senate gone.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.971 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Congress, Senate gone.

00:26:23.971 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Replace the
Senate with a council

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of governors from the states.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.447 align:middle line:90%
And turn--

00:26:30.447 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they
would pick, not us.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Turn the Constitution
over to the Supreme Court,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:90%
let them update it as they see--

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like China.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No kidding.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said do away with the
Office of the Presidency.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to have
not a presidency,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:84%
but we need to have a
committee of presidents.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it does sound like
China-- exactly like China.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
that that's the reason

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that China is the most
esteemed model of technocracy

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 75 people
control China.

00:27:03.636 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they make a
lot of money controlling

00:27:07.931 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
everything that comes in and
everything that goes out.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They call all the shots,
basically-- all the shots.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is technocracy.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Technocracy in China was
identified as early as 2001,

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
by the way, that China had been
converted to a technocracy.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer appropriate
to look at China

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and say it's communist Chinese.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
There's trappings that make
it look kind of similar--

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
they still have the
red flag and the red

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
means oh, it's communist,
and the hammer and sickle.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But those things are not
really appropriate to describe

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:90%
where China is today.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.539 align:middle line:90%
It is a technocracy.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're right,
there's a very few people

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and they all have advanced
engineering degrees.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:90%
They're geniuses.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:90%
They're smart people.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.233 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They are
geniuses, but they're

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
engineering the country.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the key here.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They're using their
so-called scientific method

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to engineer the entire society.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And they'd love to see
it for the entire planet.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And this is
highly esteemed even

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in our country and
the United Nations.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:84%
They love China and what
China is doing over there

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.720 align:middle line:84%
with how they're managing
things, whatever.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
This is not the model
that we want in America.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.516 align:middle line:90%
This is completely antithetic.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you had
mentioned the United Nations

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.084 align:middle line:84%
and how it is pushing
technocracy as well.

00:28:25.084 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE BUSH: Before
us the opportunity

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to forge for ourselves
and for future generations

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
a new world order, a world
where the rule of law,

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
not the law of the jungle,
governs the conduct of nations.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
When we are successful,
and we will be,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
we have a real chance
at this new world

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
order, an order in which a
credible United Nations can

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
use its peacekeeping role to
fulfill the promise and vision

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.816 align:middle line:90%
of the UN's founders.

00:28:56.816 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, President Bush, Sr.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: What disturbs me most
about that whole thing is he

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
talks about if we can
create a new world order.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he says-- you just
have to watch his inflection--

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and we will.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we will.

00:29:10.465 --> 00:29:11.725 align:middle line:90%
Is he a technocrat?

00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He's not
only technocrat,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
but he's one of the founding
members of the Trilateral

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: There you go.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yet an elected official.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.225 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So under
the new program,

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't be
elected, but he still

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
would want to run everything.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
If I could dare give
me the big picture

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
again about what this
whole thing is about.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.415 align:middle line:84%
When David Rockefeller met
Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1969--

00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Both are gone now.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They're both gone now.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.887 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski was a professor
of political science

00:29:40.887 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
at Columbia University, the
same place where technocracy

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:10%
He wrote a book called
"Between Two Ages:

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:10%
America's Role in the
Technetronic Era."

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered early
technocracy, I went back

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.675 align:middle line:84%
and I reread his
book to see well,

00:29:56.675 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
could he have been
talking about technocracy?

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
He said technetronic, but
could he have met technocracy?

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I read his book again and lo
and behold, I was shocked.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The themes and the
patterns in his book

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
mirrored early technocracy.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:10%
Rockefeller, the money guy--
this is a beauty/beast type

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:10%
of thing, right--

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Rockefeller had the money.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:84%
He loved this idea
because it was

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:84%
a resource-based
economic system.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
He saw a way to
grab the resources

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:90%
of the world in total--

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And control it.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And control it.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So was Rockefeller a technocrat
and was he a scientist?

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
No, but he saw the possibilities
of global domination,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.800 align:middle line:84%
economic domination
by throwing out

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the entire capitalist system,
replacing it with technocracy

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
where all of the resources
are locked up under let's call

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
it a global common trust, where
there's just a few trustees--

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would control it.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Who would control it.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.816 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Divvy it out.

00:30:54.816 --> 00:30:56.807 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And would divvy
out licenses to use it.

00:30:56.807 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To their friends.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: To their friends.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And people like you and I would
not be owning property at all.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We would simply
just be the renters.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd be the sheeple.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: We'd be the sheeple.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:90%
God term.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patrick, when you
look at technocracy, what's

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the most concerning aspect
of it and why as people do

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.060 align:middle line:90%
we even give a darn about it?

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The famous
Chinese general--

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here you go.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --General Sun
Tzu, right, from, what,

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:30.057 align:middle line:84%
the sixth century, said that if
you do not recognize an enemy--

00:31:30.057 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:84%
in "The Art of War"-- if you
do not recognize the enemy,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:90%
you cannot defeat him.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
problem right now.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We do not recognize the enemy
that our country is really

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:90%
facing.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, it's not what
we see in the news every day.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not white nationalism,
it's not the Black Lives Matter,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
it's not the political
skirmishes we have,

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not the political arguments
we have in Washington, DC.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:84%
All those things end up being so
much of a smokescreen, really,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.810 align:middle line:84%
for what's going on
behind the scenes.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to see the
enemy for who he really

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is and expend our energies--
and our anger, I might add.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If we're disturbed
by it, we need

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to expend our energies
fighting the right battle.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's the enemy?

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it us?

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Collectively, no.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.362 align:middle line:84%
I remember Pogo once said, we
found the enemy and he are us.

00:32:20.362 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he are us.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I don't believe that the
enemy is the American people.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
patsies, I think they're

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated and controlled
into the situation where

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:90%
they are today.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
enemy collectively

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to be seen
as the scientists

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and engineers behind the scenes
who were imposing technocracy

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
on the world.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoever they may be.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.083 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, they're
not difficult to find,

00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:43.745 align:middle line:90%
but whoever they may be.

00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people
we need to focus on.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
The bigger problem, of
course, is how do you

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:90%
get your hands on these people?

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't throw
them out of office

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:90%
because they're not in office.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: People
like Eric Schmidt,

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the
head of Google,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
he's a member of the
Trilateral Commission.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.033 align:middle line:90%
How do you get rid Eric Schmidt?

00:32:57.033 --> 00:32:57.925 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can't.

00:32:57.925 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
too wealthy to.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You can't fire him and
he's got billions of dollars.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a very difficult--

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
you can't get them
directly like we

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:84%
used to be able to get
our political people.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:10%
You look at Silicon
Valley, across the board

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:10%
you've got several
people who stand out

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.050 align:middle line:10%
like an Elon Musk
and a Peter Thiel

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:10%
and others like Eric
Schmidt and other people

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:10%
like that who are
incredibly powerful,

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
powerful individuals

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.706 align:middle line:84%
who, other than being
script kiddy coders--

00:33:29.706 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
smart at what they do.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're smart at
what they did, but does

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that give them any
brainiac insights

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.790 align:middle line:90%
into how to manage society?

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably not.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It really doesn't.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who benefits
under all this?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, they
do, certainly.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They certainly benefit
from the culture

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're
creating this stuff.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.156 align:middle line:84%
But in the end of it, and I have
to say, go back to this again.

00:33:50.156 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
In the end of it,
the big picture

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is to strip private
property away from people

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and basically to take what
little we have even now,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
what little we have,
take it away where

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
we end up being a nation of
renters and in some cases

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:90%
a nation of hobos.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why will government
allow this to happen?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.739 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Government,
for the most part,

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.219 align:middle line:84%
are the useful idiots
of the technocrats.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the old days, when
the Soviet Revolution was going

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:84%
on, they had the intelligentsia
of being the useful idiots that

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:90%
supported them.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
In the end of it when the
revolution got its way,

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
they went back and they threw
all those people under the bus.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:84%
Our politicians are going to be
thrown under the bus one day.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they realize
this, but they will

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:90%
be expendable at some point.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Parag Khanna
pretty much said that

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.520 align:middle line:84%
in his book,
"Technocracy in America."

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They are expendable and
they're useless, no good

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:90%
for any good thing.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people would agree
with that right now

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.480 align:middle line:90%
because it's pretty pathetic.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to be thrown
under the bus at some point.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent
of our lifestyle

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.139 align:middle line:90%
do you think is technocratic?

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I would say
probably at this point,

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.209 align:middle line:90%
we're approaching 80%.

00:35:04.209 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you kidding?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I'm not kidding you.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
don't even realize it.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They don't realize it.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many people-- have
you ever walked down the street

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and watched people looking
at their cell phones?

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They ram into a
pole or something.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.219 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they run
into poles and stuff.

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:90%
These people are plugged in.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.261 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
it, for the most part.

00:35:20.261 --> 00:35:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They're plugged into
this technocratic system.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
All of the data that gets
collected on your cell phone--

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
the music you listen
to, the things

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.775 align:middle line:84%
that you read, all
the apps that you

00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:84%
use-- it's sucking a
constant stream of data

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.219 align:middle line:84%
and feeding it into
the global big data.

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The global
brain, I call it.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.634 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:35:41.634 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The global brain is
sucking data out from you.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.769 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got smart grid,
you've got your e-mails,

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:48.560 align:middle line:84%
you've got phone calls
and everything else.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
All this data is being
extracted from you

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and used for either
commercial endeavor--

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:84%
selling it they make
big money, and that

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is for the purpose of
manipulating you, by the way,

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.192 align:middle line:84%
because it's hugely
manipulative.

00:36:02.192 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
data on somebody,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:84%
you can manipulate their
behavior significantly.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're already in
that system, you see.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Smart grid has been implemented
all around the world.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got the spy agencies
around the world that

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
are collecting data on
citizens willy nilly

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're rogue at this
point, completely rogue.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:90%
They won't stop.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Even though Congress tells
the NSA and CIA to stop,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:90%
they won't stop.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They won't stop.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're found
out six months later.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.265 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're doing the same--

00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're doing more than
what you did back when

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.376 align:middle line:90%
we slapped you the last time.

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're collecting
this stuff.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
We're already enmeshed in this.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I
don't think there's

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of time left just on
a linear calendar for somebody

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a
creative idea on how

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to throw a monkey wrench.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think it's too late?

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.514 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I don't know.

00:36:52.514 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
what will it take

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to implement the remaining
20%, and do they even

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:90%
need to do that now?

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: For them, just time.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just time.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be, to me,
throwing out elected officials

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and people like that
still remaining 20%.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We already know our
elected officials are impotent.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:84%
They've been marginalized now
for, what, at least 40 years.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But now, everybody distrusts the
political body in our country.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the approval
rate is down to like 10%.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That means all Democrats
and all Republicans essentially

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:90%
look at Congress and spit.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.480 align:middle line:84%
They're just like,
this ain't working.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And so there's already
a huge groundswell

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
of angst against the political
structure as it sits today,

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
where if somebody
comes along and says,

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.619 align:middle line:84%
you know, why don't we
just get rid of the bums,

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:49.203 align:middle line:84%
like Parag Khanna
for instance, right?

00:37:49.203 --> 00:37:50.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:50.002 --> 00:37:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Let's just
get rid of the bums

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.755 align:middle line:90%
and do something differently.

00:37:52.755 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
people may agree to that.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.201 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: What can it hurt?

00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:57.059 align:middle line:90%
The people might say, hey man--

00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go for it.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Let's go for it.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's a trap.

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And it would be a trap.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell
you another trap

00:38:02.548 --> 00:38:04.510 align:middle line:90%
is if we do away with cash.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I like cash.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind
of neat to have.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But this world is
moving digitally.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this Bitcoin
phenomenon to me

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is moving faster
than we can handle.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The Legal Tender Act and
legal tender laws generally

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.490 align:middle line:84%
around the world act as a
kind of monopoly advantage

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:90%
to central bank currency.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The downside of competition
is, from the government's

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:84%
perspective, they're no
longer able to affect

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
monetary policy in the way
that they would like to.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, many would say that the
legal tender laws are necessary

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and allow the government
to conduct monetary policy.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, having
a monopoly power

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.420 align:middle line:90%
is good for the government.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether you think this
is a good thing or a bad thing

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to depend on
your view of government.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Some would have the view that,
because the government is

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:10%
all of us, we want to confer
a sort of monopoly privilege

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.050 align:middle line:10%
on the government.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.508 align:middle line:10%
And some have the view that a
federal government, at least,

00:39:00.508 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:10%
is an entity separate
from us and is

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.530 align:middle line:10%
beholden to all sorts
of special interests

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:10%
and it's subject to all
sorts of political pressures

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that don't necessarily lever
down to the good of all

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:10%
of society and so giving
them this monopoly

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:10%
is really not great
for society writ large.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Many think that the
real benefit of Bitcoin

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to be in
settlement across borders

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and going to be in places
in the developing world

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.146 align:middle line:84%
where they don't have the
kind of monetary stability

00:39:25.146 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:90%
that we have in the US.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
No one has any
doubts that something

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that costs $1 yesterday
is going to cost $1 today.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:10%
But this is not true
in developing countries

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:10%
like Zimbabwe or in
places like Argentina,

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:10%
for instance, where they have
a major currency problem.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So these countries are using
Bitcoin as a store of value

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.592 align:middle line:84%
and they know that it's
going to fluctuate less--

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the price of Bitcoin is
going to fluctuate less

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps it might
even appreciate more

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:90%
than their own currency.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So in the developed
world, many think

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that Bitcoin plays a tangential
role, which is one reason why

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.640 align:middle line:84%
some people say, if you would
were to repeal legal tender

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
laws with respect to
digital currencies,

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be
that big of a deal.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's really in
the developing world

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and in places that don't
have stable political regimes

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and stable monetary situations
that something like Bitcoin,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:84%
which isn't susceptible
to political pressures,

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:90%
is going to be able to thrive.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't put my
money into Bitcoin, would you?

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.806 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I wouldn't
either at this point,

00:40:20.806 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
certainly not as
a store of value.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to make an
anonymous transaction somewhere,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I might use Bitcoin just to
flip some money back and forth

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
between two people where
it can't be tracked.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But the idea behind
the cashless society

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.909 align:middle line:84%
today-- this is
a global program,

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:90%
it's not just in America.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They
started out in India

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:84%
extracting the larger bills
in India from circulation.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:84%
They also put limits
on gold ownership.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like the old
days, when they took our gold.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I know.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, wealth is
on the chopping block here.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the message, first off.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The big goal in technocracy
is to get wealth away

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.220 align:middle line:90%
from the people in general.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:84%
One way to do it now
is to remove cash

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:84%
from society and force everybody
into the digital system.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's about 20%,
25% of the world that is not

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:90%
anywhere close to the digital--

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they can
control your digital--

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.554 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They want
them in the system.

00:41:22.554 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to do that,
take cash out; give them

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:84%
a plastic card; and say,
you're now in the system

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to be
in the system or not.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And get a chip,
too, implanted in your body.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You might, but
the chip in my eye--

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I use to get all
excited about the chip.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't anymore because
they know 50 other ways

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.820 align:middle line:90%
to identify you at a distance.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They can look at your
face with a camera,

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.015 align:middle line:84%
they have algorithms that
are how you walk; your gait,

00:41:48.015 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:90%
because it's all different.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They've figured out now they can
look at your iris in your eye.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:84%
They can look at DNA stuff
now, which you've got--

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all kinds
of ways to identify you.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.499 align:middle line:84%
A chip is almost
an afterthought.

00:42:00.499 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is
it headed, Patrick?

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.754 align:middle line:84%
What's your prediction of
what's going to happen?

00:42:04.754 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's headed
towards more control

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and is headed towards
scientific dictatorship.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Wealth is on the chopping
block, private property

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is being wiped out
all around the world.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:20.912 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, economic freedom
depends on private property.

00:42:20.912 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this will
be done worldwide?

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It is being
done worldwide.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:10%
Agenda 21 and 2030 agenda,
which I should specify.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Agenda 21 started in 1992
by the United Nations.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:84%
2030 agenda was the
recent update to Agenda 21

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:90%
by the United Nations.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.777 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
anti-private property program

00:42:44.777 --> 00:42:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever seen in
the history of the planet.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.025 align:middle line:84%
And it's being done where
people don't even feel it.

00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just chip it away
a little bit at a time.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't come in with a gun
and say, give me your property.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd fight back.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.414 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We'd fight
back for that.

00:43:00.414 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is they
degrade your property rights

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.540 align:middle line:84%
little by little through
zoning and things.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the value.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And the value.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But your property
tax keeps going up.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And all of
a sudden, you've

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:84%
got this property but you
can't do what you want.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't develop it the way
you want because they say,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.879 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no, no.

00:43:15.879 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it that way.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:84%
That's not sustainable
or that doesn't

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:84%
take care of two-toed
frog or whatever

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and you have to do it our way.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And you say, wait,
that's my property.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I bought this 15 years
ago, I can do what I want.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not anymore.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eminent
domain they call it.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Now, is it
your property still?

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going
to pay the tax bill.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When it all
happens, will we fight back?

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think there's a
growing number of people that

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.100 align:middle line:90%
are waking up to this, George.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think programs
like this I think just

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
do immense good to raise
people's sensitivity to what's

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.330 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because many
people don't even

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:90%
know what's going on.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They need to
see the big picture.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, a lot of
people are disturbed

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:90%
about elements of this.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They're disturbed about
cash being removed,

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.342 align:middle line:84%
they're disturbed about
EMF and smart grid.

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
don't see that picture.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.716 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They need to
see the big picture

00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and see that these things
are related to each other

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a fifth
column of actors behind it

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.200 align:middle line:84%
who could probably be dealt
with if enough people would

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:90%
recognize who they are.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's stopped
before it happens.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's stopped.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.106 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
this ability to talk

00:44:24.106 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to everybody watching "Beyond
Belief" right now, Patrick.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:84%
What is your major
message to them?

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Lay down your arms.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Quit fighting each other.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It is so critical that we
bring some healing to America.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.836 align:middle line:10%
We all live in this
country, we are Americans.

00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:10%
I don't care about your
political persuasion.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.251 align:middle line:10%
During World War
II, it didn't matter

00:44:46.251 --> 00:44:49.080 align:middle line:10%
if you were in a foxhole with a
Democrat, Republican, liberal,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.230 align:middle line:10%
whatever.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What mattered was can
you trust each other

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and you were fighting
for the same cause.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:54.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:44:54.266 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We need to lay
down arms in this country.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
just baseball bats

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.447 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, but we need
to quit fighting each other

00:45:01.447 --> 00:45:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know what,
maybe we should just

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:84%
sit back, take a deep breath,
and take stock of where

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:90%
we are in this whole process.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And be thankful.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patrick, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

>>WOOD: My pleasure, George.

00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:14.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's called
"Technocracy Rising,"

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:10%
an incredible book with an
incredible story about what

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:10%
they want to do to us.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it happen.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
