>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:10%
Matt Richtel is with us, a
Pulitzer Prize-winning "New

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:10%
York Times" reporter,
best-selling author.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Always great to have you
on the program, Matt.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MATT RICHTEL: George, it is
so nice to see you in person.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes, we're--

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the phone,
doing radio shows.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: In the
middle of the night.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, tell us about your
new work on creativity.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHTEL: Well, it
is related in a way--

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:10%
we're at a juncture because
things have exploded.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:10%
Lots of traditional
ways of doing things--

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:10%
and you can name
almost any medium--

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:10%
have been changed by technology.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:10%
It is an inflection point.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:10%
And it is, in particular,
an inflection point

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
for creativity.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So I stepped back
and spent a couple

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
of years looking at the
science of creativity,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of creativity, to
try to understand how it works.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in addition, why it's
so significant in this moment

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it is
important, isn't it?

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: I'll make
the case, George,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that creativity
is the most vital,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
or one of the most vital,
of all human traits.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And give us
your definition, Matt,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.828 align:middle line:90%
of creativity.

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: OK, fair
enough, because I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
was going to say it's applicable
to the creation of civilization

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
from Shakespeare to every
medical innovation we've got.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But your point's
actually well taken.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Creativity, in my definition,
need not be nearly that grand.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, creativity is
highly applicable to almost all

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's how I define it.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I define creativity
as something new

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that makes some contribution.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you how
modest that could be.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever walked into the
kitchen, opened the fridge,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and discovered three
ingredients are left?

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And you've somehow
made something of that.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Or do you just order out?

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You made your
peanut butter sandwich.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.025 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: You
made your peanut--

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and somewhere along the
line, some mom or dad

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
walked into the kitchen and
there were three ingredients,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and he or she put that thing
together and created a dinner

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:90%
for the kids.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That is a very modest
form of creativity.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I bring
it up is that creativity

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.733 align:middle line:84%
can span from the modest all
the way to the extraordinary--

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: --those things
that change our world.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a particularly
creative moment in time.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
May I just touch on the
science of why that is?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHTEL: So this
book, "Inspired,"

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:10%
starts in Jerusalem.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And I started in Jerusalem
because I thought to myself,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:10%
well, so much of our
understanding of creation

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:10%
itself comes from the stories
here, whether you believe them

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:10%
or not--

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:10%
the mythologies, the tales.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.238 align:middle line:90%
So much of it's rooted there.

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:14.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: It's amazing.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But I learned
something incredible

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
about Jerusalem that
was not the reason I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
went there to begin with.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem had a population in
the year zero of about 500,000.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.852 align:middle line:84%
Does that sound big
or small to you?

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In those days?

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yeah.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Huge.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge number, George.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot of it
being a huge number

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
is there are lots of people
talking to each other,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:90%
communicating.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
In a way, it's an industry town.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the
industry is religion

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of ideas
and a lot of competition.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's fast--

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And no social media.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: True.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No radio.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Right.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No television.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.053 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
communicate is one on one.

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: One on one.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Or standing on a stump, like
the prophets may have done,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and speaking to a
bunch of people,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
who, in turn, build on those
ideas, share those ideas.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
You can think of a rock as
the original social media.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Not one you threw,
but one you stood on.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why Jesus
might have been so popular--

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.165 align:middle line:90%
the way he spoke to a crowd.

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: That's it.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So in that respect, of course,
there was no social media.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
socializing of media

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
at that time in a
very busy place.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we've learned since.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
The research and science will
bear out that over the years,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
there have been these enclaves
of extraordinary creativity.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Paris, parts of Russia,
parts of Italy, Harlem, Los

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Angeles with Hollywood--
you can go down the list.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But think of this moment in
time where anybody anywhere

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
can connect.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
To your mind, how would
you rank that in terms

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:90%
of its creative potential?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very high.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Maybe the
highest it's ever been.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
The-- I don't want
to start boring--

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm passing your
quiz no matter what, right?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yeah, you are.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm troubled because
I came to stump you.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not yet.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:90%
But you might.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.723 align:middle line:90%
It's not over yet.

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Well, I don't
know any good trivia.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a problem.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
But this is interesting.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.125 align:middle line:84%
This is actually some really
not so interesting trivia,

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
but I'll throw it in.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The number of
international patents,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
meaning patents applied for
by people across borders,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:90%
has exploded.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, how the heck are
those people communicating?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: The internet, the
phone, email, various apps.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Social.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: All social.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly explosively
creative period.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never seen kids
pick up on technology so fast.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yeah.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At a young age.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yeah.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One year
old, two years old,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
they know how to
play a smartphone.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have done
that in those days.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
What are they going
to be like when they

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:90%
get into the creative state?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Well,
first of all, they're

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to feast on
this extraordinary connection.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But you've really asked a
very significant question

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and let me see if it's OK
if I answer it this way.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Can I talk a little bit about
young people and creativity,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and what the science
tells us about how

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
creative young people
are and why we sometimes

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:90%
lose that creativity as adults?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: OK.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So, interestingly, researchers
in the '50s and '60s

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
started to really
ask about creativity.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And they started to
ask, are kids creative?

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Do they lose creativity?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered something
called the fourth grade slump.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Are your grandkids
in fourth grade yet?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of them is, yes.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And are
the others younger?

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're older.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.302 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: They're older.

00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think-- given your
family history of creativity,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not too worried.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But here's what happens
in fourth grade.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible to
think about this.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Kids prior to the
age of fourth grade

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
in this very seminal study
in the late '50s and '60s,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
turn out to get less
creative after fourth grade.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:90%
The measure of creativity--

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.112 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Yes, the measure
of creativity in this study

00:07:12.112 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
is how many random ideas
the kids come up with.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And they start
coming up with ideas

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that are more cliched or more
accepted or have been come up

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:90%
with before after fourth grade.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's your guess
as to why that might be?

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh,
society changes it.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Tell me.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.445 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I haven't stopped you yet.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: School changes it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Boom.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
trying to stump you.

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm doing well.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: We'll get there.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let me
show you something.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Emmy award-winning
composer Chris Spheeris

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
talks about young
people, creativity,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and how it diminishes, like
you're saying, in early years.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:10%
- Up to the age of five,
we still have about 80%

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:10%
of our creative potential
available to us.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:10%
And by the age of 12, when we
enter school at kindergarten,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:10%
it's diminished down to 2%.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Shocking.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
By 12, by the time we
hit pubescence, which

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:90%
should be wildly creative.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
- So can anyone out there
imagine that most of us--

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
most of them-- I have to not
include myself there really--

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
are operating on 2% of
our creative potential?

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our
creative potential

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:90%
is our full potential of being.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
That's everything that is.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:90%
- Everything.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
- It's like taking
a beautiful plant

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.935 align:middle line:84%
and cutting 98% of the
branches off and the leaves off

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and expecting it to survive.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
- When we look at
society at large,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
when we look at people around
us, as I said in the open,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing primarily
exhaustion, fear, defeatism.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We've been inundated
to the point where

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:90%
we feel very small and less.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the energy.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:90%
How do you view--

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:90%
- What a great word.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
- Because I have a metaphor
that came to me about energy.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
what's popular now,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
move our energy source

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
from finite fossil
fuel to almost infinite

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:90%
solar or other sources.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
that as a metaphor.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.165 align:middle line:90%
- Potentially plentiful.

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
- The reason we're
getting tired,

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
exhausted, frustrated, cut
out, alienated, all that stuff,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
is because we are tapping into
our ego consciousness for fuel.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
- And that seems to
be running our society

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in a way that makes
us feel old and tired

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and all those things
you mentioned.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is an
alternate energy source.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
It's tapping into
our inspiration.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It's tapping into our real
fuel, which is our innocence.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It's our state of
awareness and presence.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all these things.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It's our creativity.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:84%
If we tap into that, as opposed
to our own self-concept--

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, here's
the way I look at it.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Our culture, to me,
looks like this-- it

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
looks like we're all
at a Halloween party

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.695 align:middle line:84%
and we're believing that
the person is the costume.

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting
that there's

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:90%
a person behind the costume.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
see ego awareness is

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in such a strong illusion.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting
that there is a pure soul

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:90%
behind the masks we wear.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
So how do we get back, right?

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We do what we can to connect
to our innocence, which

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
happens through enthusiasm,
and passion, and compassion,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.582 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Matt?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: First of all,
I'm jealous of his hair.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eh, it is what it is.

00:10:34.263 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: It is what it is.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Look, the science will
bear out a lot of what

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:90%
those two folks are saying.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
fourth grade, there's

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
something interesting--
you alluded

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to school-- there's something
interesting that happens.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Kids have grown up
hearing the following--

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:84%
don't cross the street, don't
pick your nose and eat it,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:90%
don't eat food off the floor.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't, don't, don't.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And there's a
good reason for that, George.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.532 align:middle line:84%
There's actually-- I'm
not trying to judge this.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to put it
through a scientific lens.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
The good reason is we're
trying to teach kids

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that there's many rules
they must follow in order

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I would point out that
what the kid also does

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
is begin to internalize the
idea that no comes before yes.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And creativity,
as I get into what

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I consider to be the
wonders and mysteries of it,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
is an act of saying yes.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
It's an act of saying yes
to things that may be scary.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
this on your show.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to go into the
creativity vomit research?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vomit research?

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is that?

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: OK, so this--

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:84%
again, this book is a deep
dive into how creativity works

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and the real science of it.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
I had to grapple with

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is that creativity
oftentimes eludes us

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:90%
because we are terrified of it.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.213 align:middle line:90%
One of the best studies--

00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
are you ready for
the vomit study?

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Fire away.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Here we go.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
A researcher says, we all say
we love creativity, but do we

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:90%
actually really like creativity?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He said-- I call this
the smart dumb question.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
We take something for granted.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And he goes out and he
does this study where he

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:90%
uses a subconscious bias test.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the test that
we use to find out

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
if the thing we say about,
say, someone of another race,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
or someone walking
across the street,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.173 align:middle line:84%
is if we actually feel
the way we say we feel.

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or religion
or something.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: All of the above.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.863 align:middle line:84%
Do we harbor some biases
we have not expressed?

00:12:52.863 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So we asked a bunch
of people, how

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
do you feel about creativity?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And they make these
associations, George.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they say they think?

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you think they say
they feel about creativity?

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they
think they're spot on.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.912 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: They
think it's wonderful.

00:13:05.912 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They're like,
creativity is associated

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
with rainbows and puppy dogs
and chocolate ice cream.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
All this great stuff.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But then they run a
subconscious bias test,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
which involves
showing some images

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and picking up how
people really feel.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Guess what, vomit, toxins,
poison, even death.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's going on?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a guess?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why they
have that flip-flop?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Why do
they consciously say,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I love creativity, but
subconsciously say,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that scares the heck out of me.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because sometime
when they were smaller,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
something happened to
them with creativity

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and it distorted their views.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: That's a great
guess, and that's a piece of it.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
There are two
other vital pieces.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Here's what creativity does.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:84%
One, it takes an
immense risk, which

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:90%
is what you're alluding to.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
If you come up with an idea
someone hasn't come up with

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
before, only in retrospect
do we say, great idea,

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk changed the world.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But how many Elon Musks were
there that failed miserably,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that had terrible financial
trouble, whose marriage has

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:90%
dissolved, that were drinking?

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many, many.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Many.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Many more than succeeded.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So the science of
creativity will

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:84%
show it is an immense risk
for those who actually try it,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:90%
and, therefore, scary.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a second reason
creativity, the science shows,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:90%
is so scary.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's because, what happens
when creativity succeeds?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
What's your take on
why would that be scary

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:90%
if creativity succeeds?

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.263 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because people might
not know how to handle it.

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: People don't
know how to handle it.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And worst of all are the people
don't know how to handle it

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.835 align:middle line:84%
who were invested
in the prior thing.

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And that
is so much of society.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.438 align:middle line:84%
So get this-- well,
let's just take Elon Musk

00:15:02.438 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
talking about him.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
All this wonderful
electric vehicles--

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
again, no political or
partisan judgment here-- but

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the
oil industry, if you

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
run General Motors, if
you're a coal miner,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:90%
that could be a serious problem.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
One person's innovation
is another person's death.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.873 align:middle line:90%
And that's why--

00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:24.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely true.

00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: --creativity
is terrifying.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
For us to be creative, we've
got to understand the terror.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have lots of truck
drivers who listen to my radio

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:90%
show--

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yes.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --coast to coast.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yes.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am opposed
to driverless trucks.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: There you go.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They are
working on them.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They are testing them.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't want our truck
drivers out of jobs.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.693 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: This is the very--
we had this conversation,

00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%
and you mentioned it before.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the perfect example of
where one person's innovation

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.163 align:middle line:90%
is another person's job loss.

00:15:58.163 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I want to talk
about Jeff Bezos for a moment.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, when he
came up with this concept,

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sell
books on the internet,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.670 align:middle line:84%
people don't have to go
to bookstores anymore,

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing it
out of my garage--

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yes.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do you
think he envisioned

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
having the world's largest
online retail establishment?

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: This is what I--

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a great
question and I can't

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
say because it's one of
the handful of really

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
luminaries in this space I
haven't talked to personally.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But I actually do have an answer
based on the science, which

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
is many of these great
creators don't really

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
start with the big
vision and the end game

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
they start out with.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
They start out with
moments of insight.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they luck into it?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: They work
their way into it

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
by a series of creations
that follow one on the next.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I'm
getting at is, George,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
creative people both

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
have a point on the
horizon and the thing

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
that's in front of them.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But when they're really
driven and creative,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
each step of the way becomes
its own creative pursuit.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me if
this is creative.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm at an event one day.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yes.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.763 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a lady
comes up to me and says,

00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
you got to help me.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what's wrong?

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.365 align:middle line:84%
She said, I went on a
date last week with a guy

00:17:23.365 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and I started talking
about UFOs and Bigfoot.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:90%
And we were having dinner.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, UFOs, Bigfoot.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%
And he went, you're nuts.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:90%
He got up and left.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
You got to do
something for people

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:90%
like us who understand this.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I came back
and said, you know

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.592 align:middle line:84%
what, I've got this
vehicle of this radio show.

00:17:45.592 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come
up with something

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:90%
called paranormaldate.com.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.418 align:middle line:90%
And it is immensely successful.

00:17:52.418 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:90%
But I matched people together--

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Yes, it's
highly creative.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:10%
It's highly creative.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:10%
I just want to go back
to part of this story.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:10%
She tells-- because
I'm going to come

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:10%
to some interesting science in
a second about this every store.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
You go home.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.382 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a car ride home?

00:18:08.382 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Are you sitting in bed?

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm thinking of
this lady on the way home.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of this lady
when I'm at the office.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
came to me because

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.605 align:middle line:90%
of what happened to her.

00:18:19.605 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Are
you writing notes?

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Are you obsessed--

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm taking notes.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: --with this idea?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.793 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I call a
friend of mine who's

00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
an expert on the internet.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let me
throw this by you.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I love this idea.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me run with it.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, all right,
I'll make you a partner.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Do it all.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.838 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do it.

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time for this.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:90%
But this is my concept.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: So, look,
what you've hit on,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in many respects, George, is
the very idea behind this book.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:90%
What is the aha moment?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:90%
It is the essence of creativity.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Just quickly tell
me, what did it

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
feel like when you were in
the throes of that idea, when

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.740 align:middle line:90%
you had to get it out?

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.262 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was an aha moment.

00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Were you euphoric?

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Were you excited?

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a light
bulb over my head.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't get excited about
a lot of things, Matt.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But this was a light bulb moment
where I said, this will work.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to show you
this Chris Spheeris again,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
the composer, talking
about all of this.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:10%
- Inspiration is given to
us as the operative language

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:10%
of creation.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:10%
It is the core energy, the
prime directive of existence--

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:10%
inspiration and creativity.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:90%
See, this is--

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking about
this prior to this interview.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And last night, I
was thinking about,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
most cultures have
called God the creator.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
- Look how much importance
we put on creativity--

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
- --in a spiritual sense.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So where does love fit in?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, if inspiration
is a state of openness,

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
a state of presence, which
is very important to this

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
conversation-- the state of
complete awareness of being

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and being completely absorbed
and engrossed in our experience

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
where there's no distraction,
meaning even our thoughts

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:90%
aren't distracting us--

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
then I think our natural state
is that of being in love.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:90%
In the state of love.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
- That presence.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
- Presence.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So I equate presence with
love, with, inspiration.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:84%
- So when I have
thoughts running,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
or when I'm watching something
and I'm speaking to you

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking
over your shoulder

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
because there's a television
screen or something else,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
or I'm thinking about my
day, I'm not loving you.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.287 align:middle line:84%
And with myself, if
I'm running my program

00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things
going on like this,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reaching for the
phone and going to email,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowing
myself to be loved.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when I can fully be
aware of what's coming to me,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
fully be aware of my experience
no matter what it is,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I am being loved
by the universe,

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.005 align:middle line:90%
by being given pure awareness.

00:21:01.005 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
When I look at quantum is
when you make a quantum leap,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
there is no precedent
for that quantum leap.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It defies the laws
of probability.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, as an artist
and a creator, I only

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
can speak from my own
experience that whatever

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I create, whether it's a
song, or whether it's a poem,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's even sometimes a
photograph or some digital art,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
or a film, a short
film that I make,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
where that came from.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
- It's always beyond
those limitations.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
- It's never predictable.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.813 align:middle line:84%
It's like I could lead
up to it by practicing

00:21:30.813 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
scales and learning
chords and all that.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I truly open up
to real pure inspiration

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and let myself just go
and become a vehicle,

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and that's a really important
concept that I don't want to--

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.437 align:middle line:90%
I want to elaborate on that.

00:21:41.437 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And to become a
vehicle of creation

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:90%
and just let it go and trust--

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:90%
another important concept.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:84%
What comes out
surprises me constantly.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So I feel-- and
oftentimes, I'll create

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.515 align:middle line:84%
something that's completely
unprecedented in my field.

00:21:55.515 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, where
did that come from?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And I call that a quantum leap.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I call it creativity
comes out of the quantum

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
yield of endless
possibility, and that

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is the field in miracles also.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, said.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.127 align:middle line:84%
But tell me about your
Charles Schulz story.

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Charles Schulz.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So years ago, I had a
syndicated comic strip.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
My editor was the editor of
Charles Schulz "Peanuts."

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, tell me about him.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
story she told me.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
She said that every
morning he'd wake up

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and he'd be overcome
and think, I

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:90%
have an idea for a comic strip.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.033 align:middle line:84%
This is the perfect
idea for a comic.

00:22:36.033 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
before "Peanuts."

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.867 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
This is "Peanuts."

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Every morning, his strip,
"Peanuts," he'd think,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:90%
today's the day.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I've got a perfect
idea for today's strip.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: He'd have an
aha moment like that.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And come
up with his stuff.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And he'd
start writing all day.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
He'd wake up in the
morning the next day,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and he would look at his
strip and he'd think,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's it.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, I have the idea
today for the perfect strip.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason I bring up that
story, and I do so in relation

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to the idea that you
had when you heard

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the woman and your paranormal
dating site, was you

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
could argue that that
woman gave you the idea.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But I would say what
the science suggests

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is that you heard some raw
material information that

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
intersected with a whole bunch
of much more mysterious dots

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
roaming around
your subconscious.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And you put those
things together

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and had one of those
lightning bolt moments.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.425 align:middle line:84%
Is that a fair way
to describe it?

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's fair.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, would I have
come up with this idea

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
had she not told me her
horrible date night story?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yes.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure.

00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: You may not have.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.587 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: That doesn't make
this story irrelevant or even

00:24:01.587 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
unrelated to what
we're talking about,

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because here's what we
know about creators--

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:84%
creators are people-- relative
to apropos of what Chris was

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:90%
saying there--

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
who take in a lot
of information.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So people who tend to
be creative, we know,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
tend to actually see
more-- physically

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
see more with their eyes,
record more information,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and take in information
as very curious people.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:84%
You must be one of the
most curious people

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I've come across.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that a fair--

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's probably fair.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: You've spent your
life listening to people

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
and taking in information.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And investigating.

00:24:39.575 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And in-- full
stop, investigating ideas.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
The reason, in part,
you may have come up

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
with that idea is because you
have gathered a storm of dots

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
inside your subconscious, that
in turn collected in some way

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and came out with
that date site--

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:90%
date idea.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But I want to hit on one
other part of your brain

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that got involved.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
What we understand
about creativity now

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and the neuroscience
of creativity

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is that there are two parts
of the brain involved.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
One is the one that
happened for you

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:90%
when that woman came to you.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the car, and at
home, and at the office,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:84%
bubbling in the round
in the back of your head

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:90%
was this explosion.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: But then
it began to get run

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.845 align:middle line:84%
over the rugged logical
parts of George's brain.

00:25:30.845 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How am
I going to do it?

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Tell me about
what you think you--

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
what do you think you
processed after the idea?

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
What ideas-- what kinds
of logic do you think

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:90%
you ran that idea through?

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The most
logical was I need

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to find somebody who understands
how to do this technically.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know it.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:84%
As creative as I think I am in
coming up with this concept,

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I need some help.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And then that's what I did.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The other part of my brain
went out and fought and found

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that kind of person.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: So that's
a perfect example

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
of how you took an inspiration
and created an execution.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And the execution is
a different part of the brain.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more rugged,
intellectual part of the brain.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much like you say,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:10%
- Now we need to generate
lots of new ideas.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:10%
It's what people usually
call brainstorming.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:10%
- Or mind-mapping.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.895 align:middle line:84%
So then you can use mind-mapping
to generate those ideas.

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
other techniques,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
but that's the most
effective one I found.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So you generate lots of ideas.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a couple of
really cool cheap practices

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
for generating new ideas.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:90%
- Can we do one of them?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:10%
Can you do--

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:10%
- Well, one of the simplest
ones was contributed

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:10%
by my dear friend,
Wendy Palmer, who

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:10%
was sixth dan aikido
sensei, a musician,

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.605 align:middle line:10%
leadership consultant and--

00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:00.405 align:middle line:10%
- Creative.

00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
- --an amazingly powerful and
inspirational human being.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And her generation
phase exercise--

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.188 align:middle line:84%
I asked her, what would you
like to contribute to the book?

00:27:11.188 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said, have
people do whatever

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness meditation-centering
practice they do.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:10%
And then open themselves to
the creative wisdom of whoever

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:10%
inspires them the most.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:10%
So it might be
Leonardo da Vinci.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
It might be Marie Curie.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It could be Queen Elizabeth I.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
- The collective
consciousness of that.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:10%
- But choose a
particular representation

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:10%
that works for you and ask that
it be present with you as you--

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:10%
- Pull it down.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.492 align:middle line:84%
- --pull it down and
approach this problem.

00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:43.057 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple,
it's so elegant.

00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:90%
- It's a great idea.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.247 align:middle line:84%
- That's how you
generate new ideas.

00:27:48.247 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:90%
- You generate new--

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:90%
that's just one of them.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.500 align:middle line:84%
There's also another great
one from Stephen Russell,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:90%
barefoot doctor.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And he created this
amazing practice.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:10%
It takes a little too long
to talk about in detail

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:10%
now, but you're moving the
energy between the front

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:10%
and the back to open up--

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:10%
basically, opening up the
crown chakra to let the wisdom

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.308 align:middle line:10%
come powering in.

00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:90%
- Those two work well together.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.235 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two I put
in for the generation phase

00:28:13.235 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
because they work well
together as you immediately,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:90%
intuitively recognized.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Creativity
doesn't come to everybody.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Why not, Matt?

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: I think the why not
is because we block it out.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
offer the simplest

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
way of thinking about how to
let it in that I've come across.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll share one of my
own to give people

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:84%
a sense of what creativity feels
like if they feel like they

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:90%
don't have it in them.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:10%
Because this book
makes the case,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:10%
again, based not
on woo-woo stuff,

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:10%
but on hard-core science.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:10%
Very practical.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHTEL: Very deeply
practical that every one of us

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:10%
has creativity inside.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a kid, we
had not a ton of money.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to bed at night
and I would dream that someone

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:90%
had given me a five--

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
not dream-- fantasize
that someone had given me

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
a $500 gift certificate to the
sporting goods store, George.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And I had a
basket in front of me

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and I had to fill it with stuff.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to bed at night
and I would fill it with things

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:90%
and fall asleep.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A baseball
glove, whatever.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: I would submit
to you that before people

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
go to bed, or at other times
when they're very relaxed,

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:90%
their mind wanders.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the most
common things people do.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Here's what they don't realize.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
When I was telling myself
that story, I was a writer.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Any time, George, your mind
wanders, you are a writer.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:90%
You are an entrepreneur.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
You might tell yourself
the lyrics for a song.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But people don't credit
themselves enough,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.905 align:middle line:84%
and often just dismiss
those as mind-wandering.

00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, it does.

00:30:05.697 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think what you're
saying, your dream state

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most creative
areas that we have.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: The
mind-wandering state,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the edge of consciousness,
it used to be that--

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to--

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Edison,
and, if I'm not mistaken,

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Salvador Dali, used to do this--

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
it's in the book, if
I've mistaken the artist.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
But I think these are they--

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:84%
they would take a nap
every day, or occasionally,

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
with a rock in their
hand or a heavy object.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And as they would
nod off to sleep,

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the object would
fall from their hands

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and they would awaken from
the sound and have ideas.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And they would call--

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting technique.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.998 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: It's an
interesting technique.

00:30:52.998 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The researchers call it
a hypnagogic test state.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: State.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Thank you.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:58.783 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:84%
What is the spice rack
theory of creativity?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: So this goes
back to that very notion

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about earlier
with your paranormal dating

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Inside George Noory's brain is
a whole bunch of information.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I think of the information
that each of us

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:84%
contains and gather over
the years as a spice

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
rack of potential
contributors to creativity.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.110 align:middle line:90%
You go into your kitchen.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:90%
You open the spice rack.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The number of things you
can create for dinner

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
depends entirely on
the number of spices

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:90%
that you have available to you.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, your
ability to be creative,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
depends on your ability--
not you, George,

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:90%
but one's ability--

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.687 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I understand.

00:31:49.687 --> 00:31:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: --depends
on one's ability

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:90%
to bring in a lot of material.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Why do I mention this?

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We live in a period
of time, George,

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:84%
where it is very tempting
to shut out information

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
because it feels too
chaotic, to choose

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.750 align:middle line:90%
a position that is rigid--

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And safe.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: --and safe.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
reasons to do that.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But to be creative, as your
other guests have alluded

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to in these wonderful
videos, depends, in part,

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
on opening yourself up to
all the spices around you,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:84%
the emotions and ideas, that
scary though they might be,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:84%
are the foodstuff of the
next great dating site.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Are there similar traits
of very creative people?

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Curiosity,
a willingness

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to listen to yourself
and the ideas,

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and a willingness
not to be so rigid,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and then a faith that the
idea that you come up with

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
deserves at least to
be shared in the world,

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:90%
even though it might fail.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you a
great Einstein story.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Einstein comes to a
colleague and says--

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you remember he wanted to find
the unified field theory that

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:90%
would explain everything?

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: It was his dream.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
He comes to a colleague
and he says, I've got it.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got the unified
field theory finally.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And he tells it
to his colleague.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:84%

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
He's known for his
number of failures.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.175 align:middle line:84%
If the poor guy had
a computer, do you

00:33:39.175 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
know how good he
would have been?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: He would

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.400 align:middle line:10%
- That's really one of the
powers that ritual has,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:10%
is that it allows us to
be able to get in a space

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:10%
where we can create what we
choose to have in our life.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.070 align:middle line:84%
- How can you use it to
really improve your life?

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
What situation would it work
with to improve your life?

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:11.889 align:middle line:84%
- Yeah, so the ritual
has many purposes

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
from many different
perspectives.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
And of course, improve
is a relative term.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
But what you'll see
is, in every industry,

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.239 align:middle line:84%
people who are really,
really successful

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:84%
have all incorporated
rituals into their life

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you see
that sports players

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:84%
use rituals to improve
their performance,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get their mind
into the game as it were.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The musicians and
artists use rituals

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:84%
to spark their
creativity so that they

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:84%
can be the best at
what their passion is.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Business leaders use rituals
to create cohesive teams

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
and to create strong
corporate cultures.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Celebrities use
rituals to create

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
balance between their personal
lives and their work lives.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And for me, all of those
are improving your life.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Rituals help you manage
your time, your energy

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and your thinking.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And all of us need that, right?

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:84%
- And so the rituals are a
way of bringing ourselves back

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it could be by
establishing a routine

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:84%
in our life, a daily
set of rituals,

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we have time for
exercise, for stretching,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
for breathing, for
meditation, or prayer.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.655 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, so those are rituals.

00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:22.655 align:middle line:90%
- Those are all rituals.

00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:23.500 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, OK.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
- And then as we
come into our day,

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
having had that sequence of
actively engaging our body

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and then quieting our
mind and our body as well,

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
when we come into our
activity, then we're more calm.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:84%
When things go more smoothly,
that we don't feel as upset.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell you
what's creative, Matt.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Tell me.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: G-A-I-A.com.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Coming up with the concept
to do all these programs,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:90%
that's creative, too.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: For sure.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting time when
you see an explosion of people

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
who feel enabled with
all the technology

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.770 align:middle line:90%
to come up with all these ideas.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But can I key on something your
guest said right there, which

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I think was really important?

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:84%
At the very beginning,
he alluded to the fact

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that creativity can be
associated with happiness.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:84%
In one of the pieces of
research I found so compelling

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:90%
in this book--

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and, again, I came at
this journalistically,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
not from a position where I
had an ax to grind or something

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:90%
to prove.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: So I was surprised
to see that people who create,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:90%
find themselves happier.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And the reason--

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And wealthier.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Well, yes, or poorer.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.415 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Both.

00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to take a stab
at-- since I can't stump you--

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
why creativity is
associated with happiness?

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it's
an innate personality

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.210 align:middle line:90%
trait of the creative person.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.377 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: And you think
once expressed, it allows--

00:37:02.377 --> 00:37:03.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:03.177 --> 00:37:04.197 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Yeah, so--

00:37:04.197 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're doing
what they like to do.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: That is
absolutely the case.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.200 align:middle line:10%
There's one other
piece of research

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:10%
that really struck me for those
who tend not to be creative

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:10%
but want to experience it.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:10%
There's research that
suggests when people create,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:10%
meaning they express ideas
that they haven't expressed

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.970 align:middle line:10%
before that are
honest and authentic,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:10%
that they feel unburdened.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:84%
That some weight has
come off their shoulders.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about this research

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is it suggests when
people do a creative act--

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
pick up a paintbrush, start
a business, write a song--

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.640 align:middle line:84%
they might feel unburdened
from weights unassociated even

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
with the creativity
they're expressing.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
very natural

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and vital about that
act of expression.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And healthy.

00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHTEL: Extremely healthy.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work?

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHTEL: Well,
first of all, George,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
they can listen to us
together on the radio or here.
