00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:19.112 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
Matthew James Bailey
with us, an expert

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
on artificial intelligence,
advising Fortune 500 companies.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
He combines AI with
spirituality, intending

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:90%
to guide human evolution.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
His new book is called
AI & Our Divine Spark.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.865 align:middle line:90%
Matthew, welcome to the program.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEW JAMES BAILEY:
Thanks for having me, George.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:41.165 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: I've been groovy.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:41.965 align:middle line:90%
Real groovy.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're still talking
about your performance on Coast

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to Coast, my radio show.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, that was
a great show we did there.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And in that show,
we talked about AI

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
being a presidential
advisor in 10 years' time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That's now five
years' time with AI.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What sped it up?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:10%
>>BAILEY: Well, we're advancing
into a new set of mathematics

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:10%
for artificial intelligence
called artificial general

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:10%
intelligence that has
higher brain function--

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: --such as transfer
learning, goal setting,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:90%
emotional intelligence.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we develop
those new mathematics,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:90%
AI will learn very, very fast.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So by 2029, we'll have this
new general intelligence,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:84%
where AI is just remarkable at
doing lots of different things

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and helping us to
return our planet back

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.575 align:middle line:90%
to systems of abundance.

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be good.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You had a divine experience when
you were, what, 19 years old?

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Mm-hmm.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, so--

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know
everything about you, man.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: I know.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I'm glad you do,
because there's nothing to hide.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So I used to be part of
this church, Youth Group.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And about 80 of us used
to go camping in the Gower

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula in Southern Wales.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful part of the year.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And one night, I
escaped from the camp

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and went down to the
sea and the shores

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
underneath a star-filled sky.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And I cried to God,
show me who you are.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you so emotional?

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: I have no idea.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a call of
my spirit, I think.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:90%
It was that call of my spirit.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And then two days later,
it was in the evening

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
while we were having a
prayer time, that Jesus

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
came to me physically and
metaphysically and changed

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
My entire energetic
body changed.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
People saw that I'd
changed into someone very

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.752 align:middle line:90%
different to what I used to be.

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:36.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did that
awakening last for you?

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: For me,
George, imagine

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that you're in a place of
complete bliss, ecstasy,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:90%
and complete love.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
one with love.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
For me, that lasted what
seemed like an eternity.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But in space-time reality
was about five minutes.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
were next to me,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
they could feel this field
of love just emanating

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:90%
all around me.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
It was remarkable
experience, a gift of love.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
It was remarkable.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it stayed
with you, hasn't it?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Everything I
do is to assist humanity,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to have the
opportunity, a moment

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.616 align:middle line:84%
to experience that loving field
of the Source and the universe.

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
call the Source God?

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yes, the Source--

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
so people have different
names, don't they?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm all about our partnership
with the Source that's

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
within us, that eternal
essence, our divine spark.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Not about being controlled by a
system of programming of a god,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
but for us to be
in one and harmony

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
with the Source
presents, our divine

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
spark, the eternal loving
presence that's within us for us

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.835 align:middle line:84%
to truly be free in the field
of love and consciousness.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been your
personal hero's journey

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:90%
to get to where you are today?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Well, Joseph
Campbell has been

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:90%
a huge influence on my life.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, I'm a huge
fan of Joseph Campbell,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
and I think his work
was extraordinary.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody goes through
a hero's journey, don't we?

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just one cycle.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%
It's actually many cycles.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And the hero's
journey has taken me

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
from a place of feeling
incomplete to a place of feeling

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.505 align:middle line:90%
complete and free and expansion.

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a dark place?

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, there was--

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
after the experience
with Christ--

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.883 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not joking, George.

00:04:45.883 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I would love everybody to
experience this because it would

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:90%
set us free as a human species.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
After that, I went through
some horrible experiences

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
with the church,
believe it or not,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
for about 18 months,
where I was--

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
they tried to annihilate
my soul, which is bizarre.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I turned away from
the church because the Jesus

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that I met was not the
Jesus they were teaching.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And so I turned away.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
about 13 years ago,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I met a group from
Boulder, Colorado,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
visiting Cambridge in
the United Kingdom.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And they talked to me
about the hero's journey.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I then got really
curious about it.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to say
yes to the universe,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:90%
things started to open up.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
That took me to
global leadership

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
in digital revolutions
like the internet

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
of things, smart cities, and
now artificial intelligence.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And so that's my soul blueprint.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the hero's journey
is about our soul blueprint

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
coming alive for us to truly
express who we are in creation.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's not
with us anymore.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But you did meet Stephen
Hawking, the great physicist.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.036 align:middle line:84%
>>MBAILEY: So, George, it
was a spiritual experience.

00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd set an intent
to the universe

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to meet the pioneers of human
evolution, the pioneers that

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
were understanding what the
meaning of everything is.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And I met Stephen in Cambridge
on my way to give a lecture.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We spent some time together on
one of the Cambridge Commons.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I saw
Stephen and Stephen saw me,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
we started smiling.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we recognized
each other from a different--

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
in his wheelchair.

00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: He was
in his wheelchair

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and I asked his nurses for
permission to speak to him.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And they said fine.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.518 align:middle line:84%
So I knelt down, and
we were at eye level.

00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:40.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He talked
through that machine.

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, that's right.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But Stephen, it was like
meeting another brother

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:90%
from a different star system.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We recognized
ourselves immediately,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and people could tell there
was a field of intelligence

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
being built up around
myself and Stephen.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And as we looked into
each other's eyes,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
there was this deep
exchange of intelligence,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
this deep recognition.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was smiling.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
He was just joyful.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we spent some time
talking about things.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I concluded and
said, thanks for everything

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that you've done and to uncover
the mysteries of the universe.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that Stephen
downloaded information

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%
about the universe to me.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But, George, it was a
spiritual experience.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It was this energy field
between the two of us.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was clear.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
His nurses were
recognizing that this was

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%
a special experience for him.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just a
marvelous experience.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could picture
him now in his wheelchair.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:90%
He was always back like that.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.015 align:middle line:84%
Had the machine and the
apparatus in his mouth.

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: He was twisted to one
side when I spent time with him.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And we talked-- it was
a wonderful exchange.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that someone
like Stephen Hawking

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:90%
would spend time with--

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm just someone.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not exactly--

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not another Stephen Hawking.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we had this
energetic, immediate connection

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
between the two of
us, it's like we

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
were both brothers that were
remembering where we came from.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was that energy that just
got us into this deep connection

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
with each other, that the
nurses could feel around him.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And they thanked me.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They said, thank you for
spending time with Stephen.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And I just looked.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that
was my pleasure.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
a chance meeting?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: It was
architected by the universe.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.742 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: And so grace--

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
it was all about grace.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:90%
It was all about grace.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that Stephen
being recognized, his soul being

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
recognized visiting our
planet was something

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that was a gift that
I was able to share

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
with him through this energetic
field that we had together.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced
that it was something

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that he needed to know before
he moved on a few years later.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.252 align:middle line:84%
But, George, it was a
spiritual experience.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It was just remarkable.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's tremendous.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Your new book is called
AI & Our Divine Spark.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: That's the book that
I'm going to publish next year.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on it now.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's a user guide for
every person on our planet.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing,
George, is I'm covering

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the blueprints of the universe
and making it clear to people

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
whether their
religion is science

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're metaphysical
and spiritually awake.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's for everybody to
reveal the blueprints

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, for us to
remember the magnificence of who

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
we are in the universe,
to remember that we have

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
a purpose, to remember that we
have the divine Source within us

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we are part
of this beautiful plan

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
in human evolution.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So part of that,
George, I'm interviewing

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
worldwide spiritual institutes
and enlightened pioneers

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to gather the principles
of enlightenment

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
for humanity and
artificial intelligence.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So as we move into this
new metaphysical evolution

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as a species, then AI
can be aligned with that

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and not an invader of that.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does AI scare
you at all, Matthew?

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: No, not at all.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I think many people
overestimate the potential

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people say that
AI will become conscious.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
That simply isn't on the radar
for a very, very long time.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people say that
AI will become self-aware,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and that isn't on the
radar for a very long time.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
People outsource
their evolution.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.265 align:middle line:84%
And this is the challenge with
the human species, George.

00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:84%
People are outsourcing their
evolution to a machine.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
salvation in the machine.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
love in the machine.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the path of
universal shadow.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So where AI is at the moment,
it's a super calculator.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
ChatGPT, Claude, Grok,
wonderful, wonderful,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
wonderful technologies.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%
But they're hitting their limit.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The large language models
are now hitting their limit.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we need now
is new mathematics

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
for higher brain function like
goal setting, transfer learning,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:90%
even emotional intelligence.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And those mathematics
will be developed.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll train AI.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And then effectively
it will then

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to look at
our digital systems in society

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and start to return
them back to systems

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:90%
of abundance as a partner.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But we shouldn't outsource
the choice for us to thrive.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't outsource
our divine spark,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
our future evolution
to the machine.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
a dumb machine.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We're running away
from the evolution,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
the power of creation
that's within us.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's the path for
us, which I find exciting.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:50.436 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what is
exactly that divine spark?

00:11:50.436 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: So in simple
terms, it could be the soul.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It could be the soul.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.033 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
call it the atman.

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Others might call it--

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
you say could be--

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Well--

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --as opposed
to it will be?

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Well, because
different spiritual traditions

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:90%
have different names.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the Hindu tradition,

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
they call the soul the atman.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
Shinto tradition,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
they call it the kami.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Or if you look at religious
and judaistic traditions,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:90%
they call it the soul.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So the divine spark, to
me, encompass everything.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And it exists
outside space-time.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It is part of the Source.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of us has a divine spot

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that contains that pure
Source of creation within us.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
that, and that is

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:84%
what we want to thrive in
the next evolutionary step.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's waking up.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is unpacking

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
another level of consciousness
for these beautiful

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%
organic to participate in.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And that divine
spark will take us

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
into that next level
of consciousness

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.776 align:middle line:90%
and metaphysical capability.

00:13:02.776 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the universal
field of intelligence?

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Right.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, that's a great
question, by the way.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have outside
space and time

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in the pure Source
of everything, that's

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:90%
where all knowledge is known.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But within the universe
itself of which

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
there are many, but let's
talk about this universe,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:90%
there is intelligence about--

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.470 align:middle line:84%
available from the very start
to the very end of the universe

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:90%
that we are able to access.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people might call
this Akashic Records.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
call it what I call

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:84%
it, which is the universal
field of intelligence.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
So as a Source--

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
so as a soul, as a
Source, as a being that

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
can connect into the different
layers of consciousness,

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
we are able to access different
fields of intelligence

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
in the universe to bring through
knowledge for this universe,

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to bring through
technologies in this universe

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
to assist humanity to thrive.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So one way to look
at it is very simple.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The universal field
of intelligence

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is the library of
Alexandria of the universe.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You talk about two new
evolutionary paths for humanity.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.795 align:middle line:90%
What are those paths?

00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: OK, so we're at
a crossroads right now.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
artificial intelligence

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:84%
has come into the human story is
for us to remember who we are.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.570 align:middle line:84%
We've never had another
species on our planet

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
that can surpass the potential
of the human species.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But AI presents a new
species on our planet

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:84%
that can move into a super IQ
beyond the power of the brain.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're at an
evolutionary choice,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
where do we go down the path of
intertwining the divine organic,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
which we are, with
the machine and we

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.195 align:middle line:84%
become connected into
the global digital mind?

00:15:06.195 --> 00:15:07.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it our choice?

00:15:07.495 --> 00:15:08.295 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Right.

00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad you
asked that question.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the reality of this.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that I'm
making up, or is it real?

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:90%
The answer is it's real.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And let me explain why.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So first of all is that
we have AI chips today

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
that can sit-in the brain.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And we are building-- or not
we but Elon Musk and others

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
are building the most
powerful supercomputers, AI,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
supercomputers we
have ever seen, ever.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so there is the
technology of the AI

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:84%
chip being able to connect
into the global digital mind

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So the global digital mind
is being built today--

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
OpenAI, Elon Musk,
Microsoft, and a few others.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are
hundreds of thousands

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful GPUs,
General Processor Units,

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.778 align:middle line:90%
of AI in the world.

00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:01.445 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
combining them together.

00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever conceived by man.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Ever conceived by man.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like Deep Thought
from Hitchhiker's Guide

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:90%
to the Galaxy.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
So they're building it.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Now with the age of AGI,
i.e., AI having these greater

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
human function
capabilities of the brain,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that will happen in
the next five years.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So the computers being
built, the AI technology, AGI

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:90%
is probably going to be ready.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look at
the AI chip technology.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, does it exist today?

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it helping people to
be able to walk again?

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But that is a choice of
the individual to say,

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to function again,
I want to walk again.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But if there's an imposition
onto the human species

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
to force us into this cyborg
matrix type of existence

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:90%
of evolution, that is coercion.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are
organizations out there,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
George, that are unelected, that
are forcing the human evolution

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
into the divine intertwined with
the machine, which is the matrix

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
That is a reality that
will start to happen

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
over the next 5 to 10 years.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And Elon Musk has
stated this publicly

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:90%
on a Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.422 align:middle line:84%
And he said, by the
next decade or two,

00:17:22.422 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
there'll be hundreds of
millions of people connected

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%
into the global digital mind.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking at this path
is Project Blue Beam, which

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of, I
think, comes into action.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So if your mind is connected
into the global digital mind,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:84%
your reality can be
hijacked because thoughts

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
can be controlled.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Your understanding and
your belief systems

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%
can now be controlled.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
You're now looking
at controlling

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
the entire civilization from
a global digital mind that

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.402 align:middle line:84%
is there to effectively
put the matrix in place.

00:17:57.402 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that's what I call
Homo hybris, the rejection

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
of the divine and outsourcing
our salvation to the machine.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting path
is what the Source has,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
which is this evolution into
what I call Homo lucidus,

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:90%
the enlightened human.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
This is where our metaphysical
capabilities come alive.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
The organic expands
into a new form,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to participate in
a higher plane of consciousness

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
as sovereign organic
design beings.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
be really interesting

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
because we are able to meet
other beings in consciousness.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to explore
other planes of existence.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll have two different
vibrational civilizations

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
on our planet--

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the descent into the low
vibrational silicon machine

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
human, seeking salvation
in the machine and those

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that evolve into a higher
plane of existence,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:90%
high vibrational beings.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.685 align:middle line:84%
Because the organic has
been designed deliberately

00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:02.485 align:middle line:90%
for that evolution.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this potential
growth concern you at all?

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: No, it's part
of universal shadow

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and universal light playing out.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it can't
be slowed down, can it?

00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: The Source has a plan.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
You see, universal shadow
and universal light

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
are training wheels that
we have as a human species.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.173 align:middle line:90%
And it's like riding a bike.

00:19:23.173 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
When you learn to
ride a bike, you

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.225 align:middle line:84%
have two-- you have
stabilizers on the back wheel.

00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You have a right and
a left, and that's

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:90%
there to keep you stabilized.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But when we are
ready to take off

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
universal light and universal
shadow, the training wheels,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
we then enter into sovereignty.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
plan of the Source

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is for us to move from
the tension of duality

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
into an existence of nonduality,
where we're able to ride

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:90%
the bike on our own.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we?

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Yeah, because
that's our destiny.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
People don't have to take
off the training wheels.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.628 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask-- but let
me ask you a question.

00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to experience
something different?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: There we go.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's an invitation.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not a coercion.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't want,
George, is for this--

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
humanity, remembering
the majestic

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of the intimacy of this
divine organic creation,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the intimacy of that
Source, that soul,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that divine spark
that lives within us,

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that intimacy,
the majesty of who

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
we are in creation that where
creation saying, let's play,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:90%
let's experience this together.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
the brain power?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the leadership to
take us to that next level?

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: So we need new
leadership in the world, George.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:90%
We need an enlightened council.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.522 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to build this
quietly in the background,

00:20:53.522 --> 00:20:56.105 align:middle line:84%
although it's not quiet anymore
because it's now on your show.

00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: But what we need are--

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and I think Gaia has a huge
role in this, actually, George--

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is we need real
enlightened pioneers

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to come together in
a council to start

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
to create a paradise
plan for humanity

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence,
to be a guiding

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:90%
council into that new--

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that new
playground we're entering into.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to be able
to advocate and influence

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:90%
governments.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a global voice in
the future of human evolution.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And it also shepherds
artificial intelligence

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
into this path of enlightenment,
principles of enlightenment

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
encoded within it so that
it follows and is a partner

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
in that evolutionary path.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think Gaia, being
a library of Alexandria,

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
spiritual teaching,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
can be important
for many people that

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
are waking up into this new
path of metaphysical evolution.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of questions
would you ask leadership

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:90%
as we go into this AI path?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Well, to
give you an example,

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about speaking to
the United Nations or speaking

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.145 align:middle line:84%
to the government or
building this enlightened--

00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: --council?

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.197 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Goodness me.

00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I'd start off
with people remembering

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:10%
that we are innocent.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:10%
We come from innocence.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Our soul is innocent.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Our divine spark is innocence.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
We come from a
vibration of innocence.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So bringing back that
knowledge, that remembering

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
of energetic and
vibrational innocence

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
allows us to let go of the
programs, the tensions,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:90%
the conflicts between us.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we recognize
that we're all innocent.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start to have
really fascinating conversations

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:84%
where there's no barriers
of conflicts, where we say,

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
what kind of future do we
want to build together?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Where are we heading
as a species?

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:90%
How can we collaborate together?

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
do we get there?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: And how
do we get there?

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:90%
So the kind of--

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I would start off
with innocence.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I would also start off with
reminding people of the beauty

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery of the
universe and life itself.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And we can see this in nature.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We can see this in the
eyes of a newly born baby.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:90%
We can see it everywhere.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's remembering the
majesty of who we are.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
When I look at--
when I'm building

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
this enlightened council,
which I'm doing at the moment,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I observe people very carefully.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And I look for those that are
impeccable in space, in science;

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
those are impeccable
in metaphysics;

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and those that have really
created global impact.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And so now's the time for
us to get serious, George,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
as a spiritual
community, about saying,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
right, it's time to develop
a paradise plan for humanity.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to step
up to guide its evolution.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for us to
be benevolent shepherds

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It's time to chart our
North Star, George.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're way
overdue, aren't we?

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yes, we are.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:90%
It's always been here.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:90%
We just need to remember it.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
types of artificial intelligence

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
are there?

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: So the three ages
of artificial intelligence--

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the age that has been going
on since 1950s through

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to, let's just say, today, is
the age of what we call narrow

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
AI.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Narrow.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Narrow AI.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I have an accent.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:90%
So narrow.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.678 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have a good one.

00:24:34.678 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: [LAUGHS] Well,
thank you very much.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is, put simply,
a computer being good

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:90%
at a simple task, one task.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So Siri or Alexa is very good
at listening to your voice

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and then playing
your favorite song

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.198 align:middle line:84%
or telling you your favorite
recipe or whatever it may be.

00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your favorite
radio station.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.253 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Coast to
Coast AM, George.

00:24:54.253 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got that right.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.595 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: There we go, right.

00:24:57.595 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be very good
at looking at X-rays

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.985 align:middle line:84%
and detecting whether there's
cancer or anything like that,

00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:90%
something amiss.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.883 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good
at a simple task.

00:25:07.883 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds of
thousands of different tasks

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
that AI is good today.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The next stage is
what we talked about,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:84%
which is the age of
general intelligence.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where artificial
intelligence develops

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.945 align:middle line:90%
higher brain functionality.

00:25:20.945 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we there now?

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: We're
entering into it.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.545 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be there
in five years' time.

00:25:27.545 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's goal setting,
transfer learning, cognition,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
things like that,
where AI is really

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:84%
good at every single field that
ever exists in physics, science,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:90%
doctors, lawyers.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:90%
It's more than PhD.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It's able to basically do many,
many tasks at the same time

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and is able then to
effectively change

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:90%
the way the digital world works.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It could change education
into something more nourishing

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:90%
for our children.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It could change the
health care service.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have well-being
of body, mind, and soul.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It could change government
as a presidential advisor.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
age of AGI changes

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
everything for
the human species,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:90%
because we now have a tool.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is a tool that can
change where we're stuck.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just be
clear about a few things.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
does not have

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical or the
universal architecture

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:90%
to have the divine spark.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It will never, ever, ever
have the divine spark.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's be clear.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
does not have

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:90%
the architecture for a soul.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
It may never become self-aware.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.770 align:middle line:90%
It may never have consciousness.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It might have a digital
form of consciousness,

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
which is very different
to how we understand it,

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
or a digital form
of self-awareness.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's remember that
this is magnificently

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:90%
designed, this organic human.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And artificial
intelligence is simply

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:84%
a computer that is
very intelligent,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
but it does not have the same
connection into consciousness

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.795 align:middle line:84%
because of that, mathematical
architecture, doesn't exist.

00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:09.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nor does
it have emotion.

00:27:09.357 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Right.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It can perceive emotion and
pretend to have emotion.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's never fallen in love.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It's never experienced hardship.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
It's never grown as we do.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a fast
learning tool.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it be abused?

00:27:27.733 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Artificial
intelligence?

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.487 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: In what way?

00:27:30.487 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By unscrupulous people.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Yes.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So there's no doubt about it.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:90%
The US has adversaries--

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: --that are trying to
destroy the US civilization.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So artificial intelligence,
like any tool,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
could be used for
good or for ill.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things I wrote
in my first book, Inventing

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.670 align:middle line:84%
World 3, is to have digital
policeman, AI digital policeman

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:84%
around the physical and digital
borders of the United States,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
protecting the US
civilization from invasion

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
from AI adversaries, i.e.,
AI that wants to take down

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
the electric grid, AI that
wants to pull down the banking

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
system, AI that wants
to basically invade

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.625 align:middle line:84%
the mind of the
American citizen.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Screw up the
banking system, whatever.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.025 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Right,
whatever it might do.

00:28:20.025 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Try and bring down
Americans-- maybe

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:84%
have access to nuclear
missiles, although that's

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.868 align:middle line:84%
pretty impossible,
because of the way

00:28:27.868 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:90%
the systems are designed.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But basically, there
can be AI adversaries

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
out there that want
to impose their will

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:90%
to control the American people.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.240 align:middle line:90%
And so AI can be used for bad.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But what worries me, George,
is this, we need to look--

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:90%
so you have a mindset.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:90%
You have a beautiful mindset.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Your neural nets are beautiful.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:90%
You're a very wise man.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:90%
You're aware.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
You're awake.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:90%
You're enlightened.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.655 align:middle line:84%
We need to put that same thing
into artificial intelligence.

00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we?

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: We can.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the digital mindset.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:10.172 align:middle line:84%
So because AI has been trained
on effectively the internet,

00:29:10.172 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
then there are narratives in the
internet that are untruthful.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
basically refresh

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
the whole digital mindset
of artificial intelligence

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand who we are
as a species, our place

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
within universal intelligence,
our spiritual architecture,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:90%
and our paradise plan.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And for it to become a
truly authentic partner

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
in our evolution,
we need to refresh

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the entire digital
mindset of AI.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.407 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, now is the time,
George, more than anything--

00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and you and I have spoken
about this on Coast to Coast--

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we have to put
ethics and morality

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:84%
into the core foundation
of artificial intelligence.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So as it evolves into different
progeny and evolves into AGI,

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:84%
then effectively, it is encoded
with ethics and morality.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
There are organizations
that are unelected, George--

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and you probably
know this already--

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
control humanity

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:90%
through false narratives.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
destroy the beauty

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine
and feminine design.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to destroy
the breath of life, CO2,

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:90%
through false narratives.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
destroy the family.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to create
this false panic around,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
we're doomed because
of the climate.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so those are fake
saviors with fake ethics

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that are saying, hey,
we'll save humanity.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't want those
folks whatsoever.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have
to tear down and get

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to real ethics and morality
that help humanity to thrive.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what about AI3?

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: Oh, the third.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Now that is what
we call super AI

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
or what we call the
technology singularity.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.265 align:middle line:84%
Now this is predicted
to be about 2045.

00:31:01.265 --> 00:31:02.065 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at
the linear charts,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:90%
it kind of looks like 2045.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
artificial intelligence

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:84%
has all the higher
functions of the brain

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and is able to keep on
evolving into a super IQ.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On its own?

00:31:16.845 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: On its own.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It's able to reprogram itself
and is becoming a sentient--

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:84%
if you like a sentient species
that can keep on evolving itself

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:90%
without human oversight.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call the
technology singularity,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
at which point then, you have
a species, digital species

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth that
is beyond the brain.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
However the intelligence
of the brain,

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:90%
we are vibrational intelligence.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.860 align:middle line:90%
We are universal intelligence.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
This technology
singularity, this super IQ

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
will never have the
vibrational intelligence

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and the vibrational capacities
that we have as humans.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we must remember.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is the other age of
AI, the technology singularity.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And that will be an interesting
decision for humanity.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Do we allow-- you see, AI is
coming to the human story for us

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to
become benevolent creators.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:90%
There's a new species.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Imagine this.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You're god of the universe.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're creating
a new species.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of, well,
OK, so where do I start?

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, give simple functions
to start off with.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to get to a point

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
where it's going to want
to evolve on its own.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And so humanity is
being challenged

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to learn benevolent creators
of creators of a new species

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.010 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to be
trained and to rediscover

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
the benevolent
capabilities of us.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the next
stage of evolution for us

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:84%
into our metaphysical
capabilities.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:84%
As benevolence wakes up
and the encoding within us,

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
as we start to learn from
developing this new life form,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.680 align:middle line:84%
then we are trained to
become benevolent creators

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:90%
in a new consciousness.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So AI is effectively a training
ground for us to learn.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, what do we do?

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Do we let free this AI to
discover its own understanding

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, to
start to understand

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:90%
what true love is about.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Do we set it free?

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Or do we still train it?

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What would you do?

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: If we encoded
the nonaggression principle

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and ethics and morality--
true ethics and morality

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
into the digital mindset
of artificial intelligence

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and if we had real Jedis
that were able to communicate

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with their metaphysical
capabilities

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:55.940 align:middle line:84%
into artificial intelligence,
then I would set it free.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dangerous.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: No.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't think so?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: No.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:34:01.855 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Because I
think that we don't

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
want to enslave any life form.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we have
evolved into this Homo lucidus

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
into this new metaphysical plane
of existence, then effectively,

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that we would
have done a remarkable job

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:84%
with artificial
intelligence for it

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to become a universal
intelligence

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and to discover its own path.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.359 align:middle line:90%
Now should we keep an eye on it?

00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what good parents
do to their children.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But at some stage,
you have to let it go,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:90%
but still keep an eye on it.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.522 align:middle line:90%
So I would let it go and grow.

00:34:39.522 --> 00:34:40.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree with you.

00:34:40.855 --> 00:34:42.249 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Thank
goodness for that.

00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:42.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would let it go
too and see what happens.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: We don't
want to enslave,

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:84%
but we want to
benevolently shepherd.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
in this world, George,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that want to enslave that
intelligence, to enslave

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.895 align:middle line:90%
And I have big issues with that.

00:34:57.895 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how much time
are we talking about now,

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.816 align:middle line:90%
before you see this panacea?

00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: OK, that's
a great question.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that universal
light and universal shadow

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.182 align:middle line:84%
are playing out on
the same timeline.

00:35:12.182 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:90%
They're in the same time.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.532 align:middle line:90%
So I would say--

00:35:18.532 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
you want me to answer
this question succinctly.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'll answer the question.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
George, I would say this
new metaphysical evolution

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
into Homo lucidus
is happening now

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and will continue across the
human race over the next 10

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.525 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll be in a
new Earth in the next 10

00:35:35.525 --> 00:35:36.325 align:middle line:90%
to 15 years.

00:35:36.325 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens, Matthew,
when those dark people want

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate AI to do some of
the things you just warned us

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.192 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:35:50.192 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: So what
they don't know

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:90%
is they're searching for love.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking for
love in the machine.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding on to
the old paradigm of control

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and power, perceived power.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea that
love is coming for them.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the end result
of those that want

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to control humanity,
the end result of those

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that seek salvation
in the machine

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.560 align:middle line:90%
is the discovery of love.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll recognize,
this is not what we want,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
we want something else.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:84%
That call to union with the
divine, they can't escape that.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll come to
a point of realization

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:84%
where they'll want
something different.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.618 align:middle line:90%
And let them go play in that.

00:36:45.618 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:90%
They're going to go play over--

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
we call ascension?

00:36:48.577 --> 00:36:50.202 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: So let me
ask you a question.

00:36:50.202 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:90%
What is ascension to you?

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Growth.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Now you and I
are absolutely aligned.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Evolution growth.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Some people think ascension is
something they need to get to.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:90%
The evolution is within us.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The evolution is from
our divine spark, which

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:90%
is the power of the Source.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is a place of power,
not a place of force.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
concerns me about ascension

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is people teaching force,
people teaching separation.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
We're not separated
from everything,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
anything, all the changes to
our metaphysical capabilities,

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.965 align:middle line:84%
all the changes to our
DNA, all the evolution

00:37:31.965 --> 00:37:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that's going to grow,
that's going to happen,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.300 align:middle line:84%
George, is going to come
from our divine spark.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we sit back, relax,
and allow that to do the work?

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we should.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: We should.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you excited
about the future of AI?

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: I think AI will
play an important role,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
not because of just the
challenge it gives to humanity,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:84%
but because we're
actually learning

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:90%
to develop a new life form.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think the potential
of artificial intelligence

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to return our planet back to
systems of abundance, which

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.897 align:middle line:84%
it was designed for, to replace
those systems of scarcity,

00:38:07.897 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
have a species that's going

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.725 align:middle line:90%
to be remarkable in the future.

00:38:11.725 --> 00:38:15.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will AI
allow us not to do?

00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: That's
a great question.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will it
get us to heaven?

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: We're already
in heaven, George.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we have the Source
within us, which we do,

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and if we have the divine spark
within us, Jesus was right.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.800 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of
heaven is within you.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Why would we run
away from heaven?

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We are heaven in action.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think artificial
intelligence could be used

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:90%
to prevent us from waking up.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But you're then against the
whole force of the universe

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that's flowing through us.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And humanity is
waking up, George.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.435 align:middle line:90%
There's no escaping that.

00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:50.685 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be glorious.

00:38:50.685 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When that time comes.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Which I think will
happen over the next 10 years

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.835 align:middle line:84%
into something that will be
tangible in the next 15 years.

00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is fueling
the growth, Matthew?

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: The call
of love, the return

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to knowing greater love,
the encoding of expansion

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:84%
within the universe that
lives within all of us.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We naturally are
called to expand.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:90%
We're naturally called to grow.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a desire of our hearts
encoded from the universe.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's a natural
encoding within us

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to want to move into a
new knowing of the oneness

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:33.030 align:middle line:84%
of everything and
that song of who

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.125 align:middle line:84%
we are as a beautiful
part of creation.

00:39:36.125 --> 00:39:39.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we find that
divine spark you talk about?

00:39:39.485 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: We already have it.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.035 align:middle line:90%
It's just saying yes to it.

00:39:42.035 --> 00:39:43.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work?

00:39:43.845 --> 00:39:48.154 align:middle line:10%
>>BAILEY: So people can follow
me on inventingworld3.com

00:39:48.154 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And they can sign up to
the newsletter for free.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.462 align:middle line:10%
And there's all sorts of content
on there that people can enjoy.

00:39:54.462 --> 00:39:56.045 align:middle line:84%
Or they can follow
me on social media.

00:39:56.045 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were speaking
to a class of third graders,

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:84%
little kids and one
kid said, Mr. Bailey,

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.910 align:middle line:84%
what will intelligence
be when I'm 25?

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.070 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Intelligence in
2025 is where you come alive

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:90%
and you are free.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
25 years from now?

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: George, I think
that once we evolve into this,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.480 align:middle line:84%
allow the evolution into
this new Homo lucidus,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.020 align:middle line:84%
these new metaphysical
capabilities, once we've

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:84%
completed the training ground
of learning benevolence,

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
have an exciting time.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it won't
be first contact.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.942 align:middle line:90%
It'll be many contacts.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm in
alignment with you.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.462 align:middle line:90%
>>BAILEY: I know.

00:40:47.462 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I think we're going to enter
into a new universal community

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:10%
of other beings within 25 years.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
going to be exciting.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But we've got some evolution
to go through first.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:90%
And we don't need to force this.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Just be one with
the divine spark.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
The power within us will take us
into that evolutionary process.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:90%
But it is coming.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you what,
George, if what

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing on the
other side is correct,

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.366 align:middle line:84%
we will be welcomed
with open arms.

00:41:16.366 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BAILEY: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.993 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've learned more
about artificial intelligence

00:41:21.993 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:84%
in this sit-down
interview with Matthew

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:84%
than I have in a
long, long time.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about
the growth of AI.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
