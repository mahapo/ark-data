00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:10%
Daniel Sheehan is a
constitutional lawyer.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he deals with
subject matters that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:90%
are way beyond most people.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But today on Beyond
Belief, it's a subject that

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:90%
deals with all of us every day.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:90%
It's called climate change.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel, welcome
to the program.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me how you
got involved in this.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I was engaged in
all kinds of different things.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%
But one of them was I was--

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been for years working
with the Lakota people

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
up in North and
South Dakota, helping

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
them stop having all
their children taken away

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and put into the white
foster care homes.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And then subjected
to massive drugs and chemicals,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
basically testing out
chemicals on them.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On them.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
I've gotten to know

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:84%
lots of the people that
are in the tribal councils

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:90%
and governments up there.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And when the Dakota Access
Pipeline and also the XL,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the Keystone XL
pipeline, were planned

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to be drilled right straight
through their territory,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
the Standing Rock
Sioux reservation,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
which is just part of
the great Sioux Nation

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
up there, the great
Sioux reservation.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They started gathering
and demonstrating

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
against that being done.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And when the security
forces, the private security

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
forces for the oil
companies, started physically

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
attacking them with
police dogs and tear

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
gas and everything else,
I was asked to come up

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:90%
to help try to solve that.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I had been co-counsel
for the Native American Rights

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Committee for ACLU National

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ok

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Back in '73 during
the occupation of Wounded Knee.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was amicus counsel
with ACLU back then.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.238 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you go way back
into history, my friend.

00:02:04.238 --> 00:02:06.426 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, well,
that was back in '73.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:10%
I had come off the Harvard
Civil Rights Law Review.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:10%
I was one of the founders of
the Harvard Civil Rights Law

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:10%
Review.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:10%
And I had started
writing articles

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:10%
about things that got me into
representing the New York

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:10%
Times and the
Pentagon Papers case,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.312 align:middle line:10%
and did the case
that established

00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:10%
the right of journalists to
protect their confidential news

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:10%
sources.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I did all those coming
out of Harvard Law School.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up being
asked to go in--

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I was at F. Lee Bailey's
office, actually, at the time,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
working on the
Watergate burglary case,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
representing James
McCord, who wrote

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the letter to Judge
Sirica, blowing the whistle

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:90%
on the Plumbers.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.852 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind of cases
that I tend to be involved in.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was asked to come out--

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: None of
them high profile.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.042 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Mainly involving media,
important like media

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
like this that can
actually get out to people

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and play a role in
helping educate people

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
in the country
about major debates.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So these things are high
profile because they

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.385 align:middle line:84%
tend to have two very
intense sides that

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
are confronting
each other with kind

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
of alternative views of reality.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
what I try to do--

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no middle
ground there, either.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: It is very difficult.
So what I try to do, I say,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:10%
look it.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at a
process that the federal rules

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:10%
of civil procedure
are designed to try

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:10%
to get at the information
on both sides,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.667 align:middle line:10%
get them up in
front of a jury so

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:10%
that you can have regular people
put in the box with the jury.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And you follow the rules.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.009 align:middle line:84%
And you put all the
information in front of them.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you try to get regular
people who have common sense.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I have great confidence
in regular people

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to be able to come to
intelligent judgment

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.625 align:middle line:84%
when they get the
adequate information.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But what they have is they
have two different sides

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
in front of them,
combating with each other

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and demonizing each
other and trying

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to assert sets of facts
that are kind of completely

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.609 align:middle line:90%
incompatible.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the poor jury
is sitting there

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.909 align:middle line:90%
a lot of times going, oh, gee.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to do, flip a coin

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to decide who's telling
me the truth here?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And so what I try to do
is do something different.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I try to get
in to say, look it.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be one
person in the courtroom

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
that you can totally depend
upon to tell you the truth.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:90%
That is what I'm here for.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm usually in a position
what they call amicus,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
which is called amicus curiae.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a friend of the
court who is here

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out
between these two disputing

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
parties what the
objective truth is here

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and then share it with the jury.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.685 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
comparatively successful--

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: In getting
the jury to say yes,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that he knows
what he's talking about.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You recently
went to the Vatican,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a climate
change conference.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, as people
know, back in June of 2015,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Pope Francis, the
first Jesuit pope

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
in history, who's a
scientist, actually.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:90%
He's a professional scientist.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.854 align:middle line:90%
That's his PhD.

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knows his stuff.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: His PhD degree--

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and he sat down
and said, look it.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There's this big
controversy going

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
on in the world about whether
global climate-- there's

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
no debate that global
climate change is happening.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The debate was about
what it's about.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Why is
this happening?

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:90%
What seems to be going on?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he took this
comparatively measured

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:90%
position, saying look it.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying that
there isn't other factors.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You have solar flares,
the changing temperatures,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
shifting of our orbit.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, they're
contributing to this.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But the question we
have in front of us

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not the
burning of fossil fuels--

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, the massive
increase in eating red meat

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and cutting down trees in the
equatorial jungles and growing

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
soybeans and generating
millions and millions of cattle

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
for Wendy's and
McDonald's and stuff

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.969 align:middle line:84%
is generating flatus, actually,
of millions of cattle.

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would think?

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Who would think that?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's putting
millions of tons of methane gas

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:90%
up into the atmosphere.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So his inquiry,
Jesuit inquiry, was

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to determine whether
or not, to some degree,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the burning of fossil fuels
is putting extra carbon

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
dioxide and methane
into the atmosphere that

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is accelerating and exacerbating
these other natural processes.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And he came to the
conclusion that it really was.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said in light of this
fact, we've got a problem here,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the oil and coal and
oil and natural gas corporations

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.255 align:middle line:84%
have hired a whole group
of public relations firms

00:06:43.255 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and are paying them
millions of dollars

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
a year to actually
try to convince people

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is no significant
contribution being

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
made to this process by the oil,
chemical, and coal companies.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not true.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And so he said, look it.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I am morally obliged to try
to use my office to share

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
this information with people.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:10%
And what people
need to understand

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:10%
is that these public
relations firms

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:10%
are the same companies that
were hired by the tobacco

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:10%
companies--

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:10%
exact same companies.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They were
hired to convince people--

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tobacco
doesn't cause cancer.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To convince people
that smoking tobacco doesn't--

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
smoking their cigarettes, more
importantly-- doesn't cause

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:90%
cancer, which it does.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And it took years.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It took like 25 years of people
trying to litigate against this

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:90%
to get this established.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.915 align:middle line:84%
And my constitutional law,
Professor Larry Tribe,

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard Law School
is the one that

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
finally litigated that case
to success against the tobacco

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.441 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
I know that they're

00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:90%
the same exact companies.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:90%
And they're very slick.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And they're very convincing.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they put out
millions of dollars

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to generate videos, kind
of propaganda videos.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that because
so many people in our country,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
for completely
legitimate reasons,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
have come to distrust
the government

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.955 align:middle line:84%
and to distrust the Catholic
church, that in fact--

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a
number of reasons.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.746 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: For a number of
reasons-- and what they've done

00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
is they're at sea of trying to
figure out what the truth is.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And if they are confronted
by slick, million dollar

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
commercials, propaganda
pieces, they say, oh, OK.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And what Pope Francis was trying
to do, along with, by the way,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
virtually every other one of the
major religious denominations

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
in the world, are
saying that look,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
this is a terribly dangerous
problem here that we've got,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that we are facing a
potential catastrophe.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.789 align:middle line:84%
United States Defense
Department knows it.

00:08:46.789 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
United States Defense Department
is making all kinds of plans

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and mobilizing to deal with the
major social disruption that's

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.867 align:middle line:84%
going to be caused if
we don't slow this down.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will be chaos.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.366 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It will
be total chaos.

00:08:58.366 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And we see it happening now.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And what we see up at Standing
Rock, up in North Dakota,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
we see a microcosm
of the future.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Because what we've seen here
is that the United States,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
now under the present
administration,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
has mobilized and provided
military equipment to the state

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
National Guard,
the state police,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to the sheriff's departments
and everything, where

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
they basically mobilized what
we're looking at in the future.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To get
these pipelines done.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.575 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To get
the pipeline through,

00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to help this
private corporation.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This private corporation
has made a decision

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to move the pipeline from
where they intentionally

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
planned to have it made,
10 miles north of Bismarck,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
a 93% white community.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:10%
When those people
started protesting,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:10%
because they came
to the conclusion

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:10%
it was a threat to
their water, the company

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:10%
decided to put it right
down onto the great Sioux

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.195 align:middle line:10%
reservation, where it's
80% Native American.

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
went ballistic.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And the people
said, wait a second.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
There are regulations,
environmental regulations,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and everything that prohibit
you from racially discriminating

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
by putting a dangerous facility
down in the minority community.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is for 25
years, that's been going on--

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
waste disposals, toxic dumps,
everything-- all end up right

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.226 align:middle line:90%
next to minority communities.

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
regulations that

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
have been passed to tell
them to stop doing that.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
know that, Daniel?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot of people know that.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.226 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no,
that's exactly right.

00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
But Chase Iron Eyes knew it.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:10%
Chase Iron Eyes, a full,
lifelong member of the Oglala--

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:10%
or excuse, Standing Rock Sioux
Hunkpapa, Sitting Bull's tribe,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:10%
knew it.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Because he was a trained lawyer.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
He said this, is totally crazy.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
These people can't
just move a pipeline

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
from a 93% white
community down to an 80%

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Native American
community and put it

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.315 align:middle line:84%
right under their sole
source of drinking water.

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They drilled it right under
their drinking water source.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sunoco Corporation
that is building it there--

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
they're behind the Energy
Transfer Partners--

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
they built it right
under that place.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They have had, since
2010, 200, 200 oil leaks

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:90%
from their pipelines.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seeping in this water.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Seeping
into the ground water--

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and we know that.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:90%
But they don't tell people that.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
And they lie about it.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
My job is to dig out the
objective information

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to provide to a jury so
they'll know what that is.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is they
swept in, because Chase Iron

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Eyes, who was the Democratic
Party nominee for the United

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
States Congress from North
Dakota, the only congressman--

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
they only have one congressman.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
He was the nominee for
the Democratic Party.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And he is a lawyer for
the Standing Rock Sioux

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:90%
reservation.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And he organized.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
He said people should come,
come here, and sit peacefully,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
prayerfully,
respectfully, and just

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
sit in the pathway of the
pipeline on land that we own.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's ours.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That we have
owned for 1,000 years.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By treaty
and right, right?

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.668 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, that's right.

00:12:05.668 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but the
administration said, oh, no.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
high level officials

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of this administration were
partners in the energy transfer

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
partner corporation.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Business partners.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, including
Rick Perry, the head

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Department of Energy.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now let's get
back to climate change.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have long
believed that the earth goes

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
through cycles, that we've had
climate change in the dinosaur

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
era, that things
are going to change.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that mankind
is contributing to things,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:90%
maybe speeding things up.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.452 align:middle line:90%
What do we do about that?

00:12:43.452 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, what we
do is we say, look it,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is there some alternative means
that we can have for generating

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
the kind of electrical energy,
energy for our cars and stuff,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
is there some alternative that
we can engage in collectively

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and intelligently?

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sooner than later.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Sooner,
so that we don't

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
have to keep on encouraging and
facilitating and subsidizing

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
the actual destruction
of the planet.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.325 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're
saying here is that--

00:13:07.325 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the scientific
community is saying--

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
2,500 scientists
from around the world

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
have all come together
to discuss this.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they believe
that the catastrophic dimension

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of the gradual climate
change that is going on,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophic dimension
is being proximately caused

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
by the burning of coal in
gasoline, in oil, crude oil,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
in natural gas, as a means
of providing our electricity

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and for fueling
our cars, that we

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:90%
should decide not to do that.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
What we should do is
we should organize

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
how to get solar power,
hydroelectric power,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:90%
thermal power--

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
kinds of energy,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:84%
which are technologically
available to us.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we, like we
used to-- we subsidized

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the development of
oil, the oil depletion

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
allowances that all have
gone on for decades,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
subsidizing the development
of the oil corporations.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we shift that money
into developing clean energy?

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of
the media out there

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
tries to present
the news to give us

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
all that view of what's
going on with climate change,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:90%
like the BBC.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Considered the world's
most authoritative assessment

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of climate change, this latest
IPCC report has taken input

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
from more than 800 experts
citing more than 9,000

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:90%
scientific studies.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It's published in three parts.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
The first about the science of
climate change comes on Friday.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The others about
the impacts and what

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
can be done to mitigate
it follow next year.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Since the last
report, scientists

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
have had six years to
gather and examine more data

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and to refine computer
models designed

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:90%
to project into the future.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> They'll draw on new data,
including on the warming

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
of our oceans.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Ocean temperature monitoring
has been revolutionized

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
by a worldwide network of
floating observatories called

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:90%
the Argo network.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists believe that
atmospheric temperatures

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
have been rising more
slowly in recent years

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
because more heat is
being stored in the ocean.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And since sea water expands as
it warms, understanding this

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
will enable scientists to
better predict and plan

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:90%
for sea level rise.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Daniel, where are
we headed with all of this?

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Well--

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happens next?

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I think
what we have discovered

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:90%
at our at our office, we have--

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.744 align:middle line:84%
I have been working with
Jerry Brown, former Jesuit--

00:15:28.744 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
as you know, I was the chief
counsel for the United States

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Jesuit headquarters in their
social ministry office,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to deal with public
policy issues like this.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry Brown has worked in
California, where they've now

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
passed the statute which
actually authorizes counties

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:84%
to join together to
actually purchase

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
clean sources of energy and
to provide those at a lower

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
price for all the people who
would otherwise be purchasing

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.252 align:middle line:84%
energy that is generated
by coal burning.

00:15:56.252 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right--
at a higher price.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah,
at a higher price.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a thing called
a community choice energy

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's publicly owned.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not owned by
private shareholders

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
or driving them
to their profits.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we have now
organized all of that.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the three
counties around Monterey Bay--

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Pebble Beach and all that area.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.662 align:middle line:10%
We've gotten all
three counties--

00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:10%
Santa Cruz County,
San Bernardino County,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:10%
and Monterey County--

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:10%
we've gotten the Catholic
Diocese to actually give loans

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:10%
to all the Catholic
churches to put

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:10%
solar panels on
all their schools

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.632 align:middle line:10%
and all of their churches.

00:16:32.632 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten the Union of
American Hebrew congregations

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
who've joined together with
us to do this for the temples.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten the Buddhist
communities to join.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And now the Methodist Church,
United Methodist Church Board

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of Homeland Ministries
is on board.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We've shown that we can reduce
the amount of global greenhouse

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
gas emissions in those
three counties by 90%.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's
astronomical.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.695 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Within 10 years.

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And what
that will-- that

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:84%
will meet the requests of
the International Panel

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:90%
on Governmental Climate Change.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We can meet the
standards to stave off

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
these catastrophic events that
are being predicted by 2,500

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%
scientists around the world.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these predictions
are pretty soon, aren't they?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: These are very soon.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
If we don't reduce by
70% the annual rate

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
of global greenhouse
gas emissions.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is happening now.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.454 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That
is happening now.

00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:10%
If we don't reduce
that by 2025 by 70%,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be
wedded to catastrophe.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:10%
They detail what
the catastrophe is--

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:10%
the rise of 6 and
1/2 feet by 2100

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.317 align:middle line:10%
of the average sea
level around the world.

00:17:41.317 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which wipes
out our coastal cities.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
as they've mentioned,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the BBC, that increased--
the heating of the ocean

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
expands the ocean so
that it will inundate up

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to 10 miles of the coastlines
of the entire world, where

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:90%
63% of all the people live.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, gone.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they
have to evacuate.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but it's
melting the polar ice caps.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You saw the pictures of
the ice caps melting.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is adding fresh
water into the sea.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
We're changing the density
of the sea from salt water

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to more fresh water, causing
the underwater currents that

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
bring the warmer
temperature water

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
from the equatorial regions
up into the north that

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
create our temperate
zone, where 70% of all

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.404 align:middle line:90%
the food in the world is grown.

00:18:26.404 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's changing.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.437 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, it's
going to be eliminated

00:18:29.437 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about catastrophe.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
a potential extinction

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
event, of extinguishing not
only civilization as we know it,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
but potentially extinguishing
the human species.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the potential rise

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
if the Antarctic
ice shelves melt--

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Melt away.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And they are melting.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they're
melting rapidly, faster

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
than anybody thought.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If those melt
completely, it's going

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:90%
to raise the sea level 195 feet.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this is
all on top of what's

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:90%
happening in the solar system.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all on top of it.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So there are gradual
climate changes that go on.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And people migrate
a bit about that.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But with data, they have
come to the conclusion

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.046 align:middle line:84%
this is being proximately
caused by the massive--

00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
now you have to
understand, 490 trillion,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
billion tons of
global greenhouse gas

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.675 align:middle line:84%
emissions every single
month being generated--

00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every month.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: By the burning
of coal in crude oil,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:90%
in gasoline, in natural gas.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
stop all that, Daniel,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.042 align:middle line:84%
immediately if
you have a choice?

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: What we
have to do is we

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.396 align:middle line:84%
have to transition
over onto clean gas,

00:19:46.396 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
clean energy sources.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've been talking
about that for years.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's doing it.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, because
there's massive campaigns funded

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:84%
by millions of dollars of the
oil companies and the coal

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
companies to pay to the
congressional representatives

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.845 align:middle line:84%
and state legislatures to
stop this from happening.

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
those same companies

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
come up with things
that are innovative?

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:84%
They can still make money on
it and come up with cleaner

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%
solutions as you present it.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because they've still
got billions of dollars of oil

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.677 align:middle line:90%
in the ground that they own.

00:20:17.677 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And want to sell.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they want
to make money on it.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an asset.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.499 align:middle line:90%
They need to make money.

00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And because
their stockholders

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
are demanding that they get
to make the money on it.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't want
to lose that money.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And as Pope Francis
has pointed out

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in his global
encyclical in 2015,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental problem
is that as of 1877, we've

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
devised an entirely
brand new business

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
vehicle in the world, which is
a shareholder-owned corporation.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And the shareholders are
demanding that the product be--

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the profits be increased
every single year

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
so they can make more
and more profits.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that when you have
that with oil and coal

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and natural gas,
they're pillaging

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
the natural environment
to siphon in all those--

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that oil and gas and stuff to be
sold so that those stockholders

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:90%
can make more money.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Pope Francis has characterized
that as a sinful structure,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that we need to have an
alternative economic model,

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
such as we've developed
in California, where

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
you have community-owned
corporations,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, it's not for
profit, for private people.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
It's for generating
clean energy.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of the income that's
being generated from the sale

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
at cheaper prices
of clean energy,

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that is being used to develop
more sources of clean energy,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and so that it's an
alternative economic model.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The only people that
lose are the shareholders

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
of these major corporations,
who are now actually,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
by this time, third generation,
who had nothing whatsoever

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to do with building
those companies.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting
back, clipping coupons

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and making money and buying
yachts and summer homes.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's that
1/10 of 1% that are

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in charge in all these
major financial corporations

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and private
investment companies.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some climatologists

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
who will argue that this is not
man-made, that man-made is not

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:90%
contributing to any of this.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Why do they say that?

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
they're being paid.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
They're being paid
by the oil company.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them?

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.973 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:25.015 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of them.

00:22:25.015 --> 00:22:26.056 align:middle line:90%
And you know their names.

00:22:26.056 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:90%
You can find them.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're all working
with those public relations

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:90%
They're the same kind of--

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.864 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've had some on
the show, on "Coast to Coast,"

00:22:33.864 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:90%
the radio show.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.134 align:middle line:90%
They denied that, by the way.

00:22:36.134 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: They denied what?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they're being
paid by any outside sources.

00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, well, you
will find that they are.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And you look to the public
relations companies.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Those are paying them.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.013 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, we're not being
paid by the oil companies.

00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
We're being paid by a
public relations company.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And they set up a shell.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what lawyers do.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So legally,
they're correct.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what they can say.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.975 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Technically,
they are correct.

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:56.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Technically.

00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:58.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But the fact
is, they're being paid.

00:22:58.353 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
They're consultants to these
public relations corporations.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're being paid
annually for this.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And the oil corporations are
giving money to universities

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to try to get
universities now to say

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:90%
what they want them to say.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, is that I'm
not trying to demonize people.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
the corporations do that

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They pay public relations
corporations and hire lawyers

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to make arguments to
try to convince people

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:90%
of things that aren't true.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Tobacco corporations do it.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Pharmaceutical
corporations do it.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.556 align:middle line:84%
We-- you and I know that
they do that all the time.

00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course they do.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:90%
It's survival for them.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And you know,
and they think that it's OK.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they think they're
in a dialectical world

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.294 align:middle line:84%
where there's good
guys and bad guys.

00:23:42.294 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And they're good guys.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:90%
They're making lots of money.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And what they think is
that all these poor people

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
around the world who
don't even know enough

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to use their own resources,
sitting on top of oil

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and don't know how to use it.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the argument
that was being made back

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
during the whole robber
baron era of Manifest

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Destiny and The
White Man's Burden,

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go out and
exploit those resources.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Because all these
aboriginal types

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
don't even know enough to
exploit their own resources.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, do they
think that the problem is not

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
going to occur in their lifetime
or their kids' lifetime?

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Hence, I'm not going
to worry about it.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to deny it.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do what we
have to do to fight it.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
going to affect us.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, actually,
it's worse yet.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
What it is is they live
from quarter to quarter

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to increase their profits so
they can give larger royalties

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to their stockholders.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the sinful
structure that they're in.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't view themselves as
to be doing anything personally

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:90%
morally reprehensible.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%
They're just doing their job.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just like--

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shareholder value.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Just
like in Germany--

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I was only doing what
I was told to do.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.662 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm hired to do.

00:24:52.662 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I've been in law firms.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
When I came out of
Harvard Law School,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I went to the number
one litigation law

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.070 align:middle line:84%
firm, corporate law
firm in the world.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
They came to Harvard and
recruited me to come there.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And I was in meetings with them.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
me to allow A&P,

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
which is one of our
clients, to engage

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
in completely discriminatory
pricing in the ghetto areas,

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.996 align:middle line:84%
charge 20% more for
every single product.

00:25:17.996 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that
the people didn't have

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:84%
money to transport themselves
to do comparative shopping

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:90%
anywhere else.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they had to buy it.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So they
have to buy their--

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would sit
right there and tell me

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.762 align:middle line:84%
that that was perfectly OK
because it increased the income

00:25:30.762 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:90%
for their shareholders.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what did a
young Daniel Sheehan do?

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Did you--

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I said, I said,
I'm not going to do that.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
participate in that.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they ended up
telling me I had to leave.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
determined that my interests

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.882 align:middle line:84%
and the interests of their
clients were not the same.

00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:90%
It turns out they were right.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were right.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because my interests
are the people of the world.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
My interests are the health
of the people of the world.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why I ended up deciding
that my best client would

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
be the Jesuit order of
the Catholic Church, who

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:90%
has an obligation.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is an
interesting client.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: A very
interesting client--

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and so I said, look it.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not just going
to buy what they say.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.357 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to test it.

00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to challenge it.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.523 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to say, look it.

00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:16.510 align:middle line:10%
I will always argue on
behalf of the truth.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't get paid to
just be a stooge for somebody.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I try to find out
completely independently.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I am personally convinced,
based on all the best evidence,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, the
proximate causation

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
of the catastrophic dimensions
of global climate change

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
are being proximately caused
by the burning of coal, oil,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:90%
petroleum, and natural gas.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know exactly
what the numbers are,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
how much is being put
into the atmosphere,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and what the direct
consequences of that are.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.231 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it's
magnifying, isnt'?

00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:50.814 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's
why I've come to try

00:26:50.814 --> 00:26:52.356 align:middle line:90%
to help people understand this.

00:26:52.356 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Because there's lots of people
in our listening audience,

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
viewing audience, who are
watching these slick propaganda

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:90%
pieces.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And believing them.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.968 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, sure they are.

00:27:00.968 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Because why would they not?

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like living in
the middle of Kansas somewhere.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And your source of information
is Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.576 align:middle line:90%
And what are you going to do?

00:27:13.576 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%
That's-- people believe it.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple
of years ago, there

00:27:16.241 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
was a documentary called
"Merchants of Doubt."

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> The tobacco companies knew
nicotine was an addictive drug,

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:10%
yet they told Congress.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe nicotine
is not addictive.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You see the same small group
of people that the tobacco

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
industry used working on
all kinds of other issues.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Dioxins, pesticides,
chemicals in general--

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no evidence
that these are harming us.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists would
explain the science.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Against the scientist, they
will have a so-called expert.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.255 align:middle line:10%
>> Seven-week-old
baby was in a crib.

00:27:47.255 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I literally heard a gasp when
he told the story about this

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
baby.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Either one of you paid
to testify for your time

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:90%
here in opposition to the bill?

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Citizens for Fire Safety.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Citizens for Fire Safety, the
three largest makers of flame

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
retardants in the world.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of these so-called
experts turn out to be very,

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:90%
very good at it.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not a scientist,
although I do play one on TV

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:10%
occasionally--

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:10%
OK, hell, more
than occasionally.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It creates a whole
new cast of characters,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
these people who become
well-known for casting doubt

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
on global warming.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So these
people, you think

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.476 align:middle line:84%
some of them--
maybe all of them--

00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
are being paid to
say what they say.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: They are.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think they
believe, though, personally?

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they agree
with you quietly?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, there are
memos inside their own offices

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.006 align:middle line:84%
that acknowledge that they're
not telling the truth.

00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:39.879 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:39.879 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: But they don't care.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the sad part.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
they say, well, that's

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
somebody else's
job to prove that.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if somebody
truly had a conviction,

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for that.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Stand by what you're saying.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.945 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no, no--

00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I love, I love talking to
people who sincerely believe

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.892 align:middle line:90%
what it is they're saying.

00:28:56.892 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
At least they're not phonies.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And then you can
have an intelligent conversation

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
with them and say, OK, look it.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.283 align:middle line:84%
Let's both agree that we're
going to look at information

00:29:04.283 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and try to talk
together intelligently

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and decide what we
think is true here.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you have someone
who they're just

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:84%
being paid to blather,
that's what they do.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
problem with lawyers.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.020 align:middle line:84%
50% of all the lawyers
just do whatever

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:90%
it is they're paid to say.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.225 align:middle line:90%
And they say, look it.

00:29:22.225 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:90%
If a car company says, oh, yeah.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
We have a serious default, or
serious fault in our car here.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.527 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to kill
10,000 people a year.

00:29:32.527 --> 00:29:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It says, what we
have to do is we have

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to compute how many
of those are going

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to stand
up against our lawyers

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and actually get to court.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And those that get to court,
if we can pay them off,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
cheaper than having

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:90%
to fix the flaw in our car.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they hire
lawyers to do that.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And some lawyers will agree
to do that kind of thing.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, law is the law.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
protect what they do.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.070 align:middle line:84%
That's their covenant
to do that, I mean.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.044 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Unless
they're killing people.

00:30:01.044 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
well, OK, but there

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.820 align:middle line:84%
are some lawyers who
have to defend murderers.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they don't like it.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure many lawyers
go, I know this guy did it.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.230 align:middle line:90%
But I got to defend him.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It's my creed.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's why I
left F Lee Bailey's office.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.550 align:middle line:90%
He wanted me to--

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:84%
he wanted me to do a
brief for a guy that

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.340 align:middle line:84%
was a hired killer for Michael
Angiulo, the head of the mob.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said I wouldn't.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you
what I said to him.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I wouldn't
put pencil to paper

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:90%
to try to protect him.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Because that's not what I do.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:90%
What I do is something else.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to find the spiritual
community of the world, people

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
who are genuinely spiritual, who
are generally devoted to trying

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:90%
to find out the truth.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge for our
human family to survive.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At what point--

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
because we've talked about
before on the program--

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the six feet of water that
would rise in the oceans that

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.691 align:middle line:90%
would annihilate the coasts.

00:30:57.691 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, no, no.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.606 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't annihilate.

00:30:59.606 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:84%
What it does, most
importantly, is it inundates.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.939 align:middle line:84%
It creeps in to the water table
and contaminates all the water.

00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it also
comes in, right?

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It comes
in in tidal surges.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
what it does is it

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
when the tidal
surges come in, you

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:84%
get things like happened
in New York, destroyed.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When will we see
that happening in mass?

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It'll start
happening around 2020,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.145 align:middle line:84%
unless we have a
radical reduction.

00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's only a
few years from now.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's exactly right.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this has
to be a Manhattan Project.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:90%
We have to mobilize.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And the fortunate
part is, is that we

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:84%
have vehicles like the Community
Choice Energy company policies.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:84%
We can get these statutes
passed in the various states.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:90%
We can get the churches.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:90%
We can-- I have the advantage.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I can get the Catholic church
in every single diocese

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
to agree to give loans

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to all of their churches
to put solar panels on all

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:90%
their churches and schools.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And we can persuade all the
other religious denominations--

00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do it.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: To come board.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're doing.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.734 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great start.

00:32:04.734 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, it is.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is we don't
want people just mouthing

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:84%
completely false
propaganda platitudes,

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:84%
like you see these people
being paid to create here,

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
in trying to convince people
when they personally haven't

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.145 align:middle line:90%
looked into the information.

00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that other side,
no doubt, says this is a hoax.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
This is an affront
on capitalism.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you fight that, Daniel,
in this society, when people

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:90%
are concerned about jobs?

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.519 align:middle line:84%
And they would
look the other way.

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: What you
try to do, for example,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
is to point out to them
that if, in fact, you set up

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
wind generators and solar panel
generators, in building those,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
you would get 50 times more
jobs than they're promising

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to give you by building
an oil pipeline

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.322 align:middle line:90%
through your community.

00:32:55.322 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're
lying to you and say,

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is going
to generate jobs.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.120 align:middle line:84%
This is going to generate-- that
pipeline is going to generate

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:90%
6,000 jobs for two years.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And then it's over.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.590 align:middle line:84%
If they, in fact, went to
wind power, into solar power

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
up there, it would generate
25,000 permanent jobs

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So would you say
to people, look,

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.196 align:middle line:84%
as if you're being
appealed to basically

00:33:17.196 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
on your own short-term
personal financial interest--

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.210 align:middle line:84%
let me show you that there's a
better argument here on behalf

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of developing clean
energy sources.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It's clean energy,
better jobs, longer jobs,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and jobs that help
everybody else in the world.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other
countries taking the lead?

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: China, China,
which is the other--

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:84%
we are number one and
number two with China

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.985 align:middle line:84%
generating the global
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:90%
They are putting billions--

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're number one now.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, that's right.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.141 align:middle line:84%
And what they're doing is
putting billions and billions

00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
of dollars into developing
solar fields in China right now.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And they are developing
alternative sources of energy.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And if our country doesn't
get busy into helping

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to develop these
types of industries,

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
eclipsed by China.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
China is going to
have a monopoly

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.204 align:middle line:84%
on basically all of the
alternative sources of energy.

00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
making billions and billions

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and billions of dollars--

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're way
ahead of the curve.

00:34:09.996 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And taking jobs
that our people could use.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this is
scary how we have

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
a completely false
alternative reality being

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
presented to us through
these propaganda machines.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have seen this,
this age that we're in,

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
this post-modern age, where the
philosophers are telling us,

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, because of the discovery
of quantum physics,

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:84%
you can't really tell
what is absolutely true.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.530 align:middle line:84%
There is no absolute
truth anymore.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
your truth is as
good as my truth.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:84%
You remember that George
Lakoff from Berkeley

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
has written about
framing things.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And the George W administration,
George W Bush administration,

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
would just say things,
just assert things

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:90%
that are completely untrue.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Dick Cheney
said to Dick Wolf, one

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Democratic
candidate guys,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.660 align:middle line:84%
he said, the problem
with the Democratic Party

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.160 align:middle line:84%
that you guys have
got, you're still

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
functioning on a
fact-based reality.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said to him.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:90%
He said, we know better.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
frame it the way that it

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:90%
would be if we were winning.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And we just tell people that.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talking about the pope,
he was at the White House back

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
several years ago, talking
about climate change.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. President, I finding
it encouraging that you are

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:40.278 align:middle line:10%
proposing an initiative
for reducing air pollution.

00:35:40.278 --> 00:35:44.816 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:44.816 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Accepting the urgency,
it seems clear to me

00:35:51.080 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
also that climate change is
a problem we can no longer be

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.508 align:middle line:90%
left to a future generation.

00:36:04.508 --> 00:36:09.942 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:09.942 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to the
care of our common home,

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:10%
we are living at a
critical moment of history.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:27.510 align:middle line:84%
We still have time to
make the change needed

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to be bring about a sustainable
and integral development.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:84%
For we know that
things can change.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty big when a
religious leader starts talking

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:44.430 align:middle line:90%
about climate change like that.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Would he be invited
back to the White House

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:90%
nowadays to say that?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no, no.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the Secretary of
State is now the head of Exxon

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Mobil, the CEO of Exxon Mobil.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The head of the
Energy Department

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is Rick Perry, who was a
partner of the Energy Transfer

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Partners in Standing Rock.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's who
these people are.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.725 align:middle line:84%
The woman who has been appointed
to be the head of the--

00:37:12.725 --> 00:37:15.630 align:middle line:84%
the Secretary of
Education, her brother

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is Erik Prince, the
guy that created

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Blackwater International that
is hired by a Royal Dutch Shell.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Protect these places.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To suppress
the local population

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:84%
who's protesting
the contamination

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.570 align:middle line:90%
of their water in Africa.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to be listening to us.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So can you win, Daniel?

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, we can
win, but only if people all

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:84%
try to understand that
what we have to do

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:84%
is we have to take
care of our planet,

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
not just for the stockholders
of the major oil corporations,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
but for our children,
our grandchildren,

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:84%
other people's grandchildren
around the world who

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.200 align:middle line:84%
are going to be having
their property inundated,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.435 align:middle line:84%
their clean water contaminated,
by the rising sea levels.

00:38:00.435 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
challenge, George.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a spiritual challenge.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And the sad fact is that most
people don't pay any attention

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual issues, except
on Sunday morning, one day

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:90%
a week, if that.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If that.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.516 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And what we have
to understand is that allowing

00:38:16.516 --> 00:38:19.680 align:middle line:84%
this kind of damage to be
inflicted upon the people who

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:84%
are living in massive droughts
now because of the increase--

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.970 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
if we don't bring down

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
these global greenhouse
gas emissions

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to 70% below their
present level by 2025,

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
what we're talking about
is 135 degree temperatures

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Southwest United States.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbearable.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Unlivable.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't live.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Unlivable.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't live.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.626 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And you're
talking about increasing

00:38:45.626 --> 00:38:48.510 align:middle line:84%
the deserts all across the
world, a massive migration

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like Mars.

00:38:50.393 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, I
mean, here we are

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
talking about terraforming
Mars, and un-terraforming

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:84%
our own planet,
and all for what?

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
For the sake of
the profits of 1/10

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of 1% of the richest people
in the world already so

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
they can buy what-- other
summer homes or more fast cars.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More, more, more.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: More.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that what I'm saying--
this is a spiritual problem.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to care more
about other people

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:84%
in the world, other
generations to come,

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:84%
than we do the private
profits of a corporation.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Because it's frankly not true.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven over
and over and over again

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that giving more and
more money, more and more

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:84%
tax breaks, to the richest
people in the country

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and to the
corporations is somehow

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.150 align:middle line:90%
going to trickle down to us.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.130 align:middle line:84%
They've tried it two
times before-- the Reagan

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.150 align:middle line:84%
administration and the George
HW Bush administration.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And both times, the corporations
and the richest people,

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
all they did is bought
out their competitors

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.980 align:middle line:84%
with that extra
money they saved.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.570 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do anything.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.835 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do anything to help
the regular working people.

00:40:00.835 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:84%
They just bought out
their competitors.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think the pope should

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
do what he's doing to get
the word out about this?

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, I do.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that every single,
every single house of worship

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
in the country, whatever
your beliefs are,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.490 align:middle line:90%
should get this word out.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
an emergency situation

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%
that our human family is facing.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
This is something
analogous to the churches

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
not having spoken up in the
face of the rise of fascism

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in Germany in the 1930s.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They even politically
sided with the Nazis

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.646 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:40:34.646 --> 00:40:35.446 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:35.446 --> 00:40:37.530 align:middle line:84%
They all said, oh,
if we'd only known.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Who would have known that
it would have come to this?

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Who would have
known that it would

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:90%
have been this complicated?

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.641 align:middle line:84%
But they're staring at
it right in the face

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
right now with this
administration, all the putting

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
at the disposal of the
private corporations

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and their shareholders all
of the instrumentalities

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:90%
of our government.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.375 align:middle line:84%
And they brought it to
bear at Standing Rock.

00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will it take guts?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Will it take guts
to fix all this?

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh,
it'll take courage

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to stand up against the richest
and the most powerful people

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:84%
in the country in their
attempt to basically commandeer

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the entire political
representation in our Congress

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
by paying off the
Congress people,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:90%
paying for their elections.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now 86% of all the members
of Congress are lawyers.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to do what
their clients pay them to do.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And when their
campaigns are being

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.350 align:middle line:84%
paid for by these
corporations, they're

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
going to do what the
corporations want.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they're stealing
our own representatives.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.550 align:middle line:90%
So we've got to stop this now.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can these people win.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:90%
They have in some cases.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But can they stop
things like pipelines

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:90%
going through their land?

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:90%
What we can do is--

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.840 align:middle line:84%
the problem is, for example,
in filing the case they did,

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the tribes filed
in Washington, DC,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the judge who has assigned that
case, Boasberg, Boasberg is

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:84%
a Republican appointee to
the federal district court.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He is a member of the
William Bennett Williams Inn.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a private
club of lawyers who

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.190 align:middle line:84%
are defense attorneys,
criminal defense attorneys,

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:19.240 align:middle line:84%
for corporate criminals,
white collar criminals.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.727 align:middle line:84%
And he's a member of
that organization.

00:42:21.727 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody is
sitting down saying, oh,

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're pointing
more and more of them--

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Gorsuch.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I just suggest to people,
listen to the testimonies that

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
were given about Gorsuch and
what he's done in the past.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.986 align:middle line:84%
They're handmaidens to
these major corporations.

00:42:36.986 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:90%
And you have to be careful.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
happened like that, though.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But when it
gets to be terrible,

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.490 align:middle line:84%
like it was in the
robber baron era--

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:90%
that point from 1868 to 1898--

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to the point where you got
the McKinley administration

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.180 align:middle line:90%
came in in 1898.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
is they started

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.220 align:middle line:84%
sending foreign military
expeditions into Central

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.190 align:middle line:84%
America on behalf
of United Fruit

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow their
democratically

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
elected governments so that
they could plant bananas there.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
happening right now.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a
corporate takeover

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of our Congress, a corporate
takeover of our military,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:84%
a corporate takeover of our
law enforcement agencies.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do small cities of
less than 50,000 people

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:90%
need military barricades?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a film back in the
1960s called "Inherit the Wind."

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at that.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Darwin took us
forward to a hilltop,

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
from where we could look back
and see the way from which we

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:90%
came.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But for this insight
and for this knowledge,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:47.339 align:middle line:84%
we must abandon our faith in
the pleasant poetry of Genesis.

00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:49.784 align:middle line:90%
>> We must not abandon faith.

00:43:49.784 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:90%
Faith is a most important thing.

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:55.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Then why did God plague
us with the power to think?

00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:58.442 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Brady, why do you deny
the one faculty of man

00:43:58.442 --> 00:44:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that raises him above
the other creatures

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, the power
of his brain to reason?

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:08.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Spencer Tracy was
pretty convincing as a lawyer.

00:44:08.586 --> 00:44:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: Spencer
Tracy was also

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:10%
very convincing in the
"Judgment at Nuremberg,"

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.470 align:middle line:10%
where he played the
Vermont judge who

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:10%
sat in judgment on the
lawyers and the judges

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:10%
in Germany, who in fact,
knowingly went along

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.870 align:middle line:10%
with the efforts on the part
of the fascist government

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.020 align:middle line:10%
to try to make
Germany great again,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.650 align:middle line:10%
to try to keep Germany from
being spit upon and insulted

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:10%
by the rest of the world.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is
that when he went along

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:84%
with all those
rules being passed,

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and Spencer Tracy faced
Burt Lancaster, who

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:84%
was playing a famous
judge in Germany,

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and he had been found
out to have sentenced

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.040 align:middle line:84%
to death a Jewish guy for
having had a young woman

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.560 align:middle line:90%
friend, platonic friend.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was prohibited
by a law that

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.560 align:middle line:84%
was passed by the legislature
in Germany, signed

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
into law by the legal
head of the government.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And he sentenced him to death.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And Burt Lancaster said to
Spencer Tracy in that scene,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I just need you to
understand and believe me

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that when I sentenced that
one innocent man to death,

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I never thought that it would
come to what it came to.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, how right he was.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Spencer
Tracy said to him,

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:84%
when you sentenced one
innocent person to death,

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.245 align:middle line:84%
knowing that he was innocent,
it had already come to that.

00:45:37.245 --> 00:45:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:45:38.045 --> 00:45:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And it's
already come to that.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We are looking it right in the
face in this administration.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:84%
This is an administration that
is attempting to hand over

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the control and all the
instrumentalities of government

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to the benefit of
private corporations.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.764 align:middle line:84%
And we are looking
at it right now.

00:45:55.764 --> 00:45:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And we are standing
in that exact moment

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.770 align:middle line:84%
that that judge that
Burton Lancaster played.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.224 align:middle line:84%
We are now faced
with this decision of

00:46:02.224 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:84%
whether or not
we're going to take

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.590 align:middle line:84%
all the steps necessary to
stop the corporate takeover

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of our government, our
democratic institutions,

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and our planet, and
our planet's future,

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:21.395 align:middle line:84%
by some coupon clipping
shareholders in the oil, coal,

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:90%
and gas corporations.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any
middle ground here, Daniel?

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.305 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that can be
worked out with both sides?

00:46:27.305 --> 00:46:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yes,
there definitely is.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.650 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
get those corporations

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to agree to invest in
alternative clean energy

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:36.870 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems simple.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.261 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They have billions
and billions and billions

00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:90%
of dollars of profits.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But instead of passing them
off to the stockholders

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and letting them buy
another summer place,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
reinvest that income into
developing alternative energy

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.160 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.571 align:middle line:84%
And they can make billions
of dollars of profit.

00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And get great
publicity to boot, right?

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:46:58.192 --> 00:46:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why
don't they do that?

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.066 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
they don't want

00:47:01.066 --> 00:47:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to forego the short-term
profit of the materials

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that they've already laid
claim to in the ground.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The reality is most of that
oil is in Saudi Arabia.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Or it's in such crude form.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Iraq.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Or it's in such
crude form up in Canada

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that they have to pipe
it through pipelines.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:84%
One thing to remember
in closing is

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that not one single
drop of that oil

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.717 align:middle line:84%
is coming through
the XL pipeline.

00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't go to us.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.216 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Doesn't
come to relieve

00:47:28.216 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
any of the energy needs of
anybody in the United States.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.998 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:47:30.998 --> 00:47:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It goes to Japan and
every place else.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.501 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It's all being sold.

00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:35.629 align:middle line:84%
It's all being sold on
the international market.

00:47:35.629 --> 00:47:36.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, at big bucks.

00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: At big
bucks for those

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.250 align:middle line:84%
shareholders-- doesn't help
one single unit of energy

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.900 align:middle line:90%
get generated in our country.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do legislators
have the ability legally

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.310 align:middle line:90%
to legislate morality?

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There's
a special form,

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.480 align:middle line:84%
or what they call mode
of ethical reasoning,

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that makes this
completely legitimate.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's related to a spiritual
perspective that is not

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.280 align:middle line:90%
fully understood by people.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Because frankly, the
Roman Catholic Church,

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
when it ascended to power
in the third century AD,

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that 99% of all the people
under their jurisdiction

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.290 align:middle line:90%
couldn't read or write.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that they
simplified, and simplified,

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and simplified a more complex
understanding of spirituality.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is, is that
the spirituality that I'm

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about is the fact
that if you sit at night

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and look up into the sky
and pick out a distant star,

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.557 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that we now
know they are planets orbiting--

00:48:39.557 --> 00:48:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Orbiting these--

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around.

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There other living
civilizations on those stars,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.120 align:middle line:90%
on those planets.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And they look down at
us and try to understand

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.450 align:middle line:84%
how it is that we're
conducting ourselves.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Just think in terms of
conducting yourself in a way

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:56.920 align:middle line:84%
that you could
reasonably support

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and defend by explaining
how we conduct ourselves.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can't.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: But we can.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:84%
All spirituality is, is getting
a higher and higher and higher

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness from
the perspective of which you

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.830 align:middle line:90%
make your judgments.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that you can do
this without having to say,

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.571 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's some big,
white, anthropomorphic male

00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:19.570 align:middle line:84%
being sitting on a throne
somewhere telling us--

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dictating to us.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: What
to do, dictating,

00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:23.800 align:middle line:84%
or some pope somewhere,
or some bishop somewhere,

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.614 align:middle line:90%
or some clergyman somewhere.

00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
No, that's not what
we're talking about.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.696 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about is people

00:49:28.696 --> 00:49:31.050 align:middle line:84%
having a higher and higher
level of consciousness.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's completely
authorized.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.590 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
unlawful about that.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And what we're saying is
that if you have a broader

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.260 align:middle line:84%
perspective on reality
and what's going on,

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that is a mode of ethical
reasoning from the perspective

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:90%
of which you can legislate.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that
we're advocating here.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:10%
The fact that that happens to
correlate with spirituality

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:55.030 align:middle line:10%
in an ever-increasing
spiritual consciousness

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.400 align:middle line:10%
is an important
thing that we just

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.250 align:middle line:10%
need to help get the churches
and synagogues and temples

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.460 align:middle line:10%
and others to explain that
to more and more people,

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.067 align:middle line:10%
now that people can read
and think more effectively.

00:50:06.067 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to do.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the
pope like to happen?

00:50:09.895 --> 00:50:12.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: The pope would
like to happen-- in fact,

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.360 align:middle line:10%
the pope has, in
fact, reached out now

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.220 align:middle line:10%
to have the Monterey diocese
come and be at the Vatican

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:10%
Pavilion as a best
practices example of how

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.321 align:middle line:10%
to respond to the threat
of global climate change.

00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
doing that from June

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to August at the big
pavilion to show people

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:84%
how you participate concretely
in helping to bring down

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:84%
global greenhouse gas emissions,
whether you're doing it

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
in response to Pope
Francis's papal encyclical,

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.970 align:middle line:84%
or just because of the
response to the objective facts

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and science that's
actually available for us.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would--

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and so he has actually-- we
know what we'd like him to do.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.830 align:middle line:84%
He's invited us to come and be
a best example of how to respond

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.584 align:middle line:90%
to the global climate change.

00:50:56.584 --> 00:50:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
seem to have your eye

00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.630 align:middle line:90%
on helping people, Daniel.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So continue doing
what you're doing.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got to do it.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: All of us have
to do it, not just somebody.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't assign it to someone else.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs to get on
board this thing right now

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and do what every person
can do to try to draw down

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.540 align:middle line:84%
these global greenhouse
gas emissions

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and protect our
democratic institutions

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from being taken over
by these oil, gas,

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:90%
and coal corporations.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.591 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on Beyond Belief, Daniel.

00:51:27.591 --> 00:51:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's a privilege
to get to be here, George.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regardless
of how you believe

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and what you think
about climate change,

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
there is no doubt
it's happening.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening fast.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.030 align:middle line:10%
And something has
to be done about it.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
this special program

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.430 align:middle line:90%
of Beyond Belief.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:54.304 align:middle line:90%
