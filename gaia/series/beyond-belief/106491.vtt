00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:07.619
(mystical orchestral music)

2
00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:09.920
<v ->The fact that hundreds and hundreds of people</v>

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.305
have gone in to National Parks and Forests,

4
00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.349
tried to enjoy our public lands

5
00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.977 line:15% 
and disappeared or were killed?

6
00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:19.980
It's something that the public needs to know about.

7
00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.430
<v ->This is, this is too much now,</v>

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.601 line:15% 
this is too much to be coincidence.

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.529 line:15% 
We're talkin' about cold, hard evidence.

10
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.113
<v ->He called me and said</v>

11
00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:31.033
"They're not telling you everything.

12
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.076
"One of these days I hope you find out the truth."

13
00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:34.236
<v ->Just find me a bone.</v>

14
00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:37.371
Just find me something for actual proof.

15
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.124
<v ->I think I made a mistake just by answering when I did.</v>

16
00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:43.787
(mystical music final)

17
00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:46.128
(moves into chaotic music overture)

18
00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:47.145
<v Voiceover>Many people today,</v>

19
00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:48.591
don't know what to believe anymore.

20
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.507
<v Voiceover>People are basically gonna keep on to</v>

21
00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:53.139
help uncover what really happened.

22
00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:55.349
<v Voiceover>It felt like something was watching me.</v>

23
00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:57.267
<v Voiceover>We weren't given all the information.</v>

24
00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:59.770
We weren't told the entire story.

25
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.846
(mystical music finale)

26
00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:07.569 line:15% 
<v ->Welcome to Beyond Belief, I'm George Noory.</v>

27
00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.361 line:15% 
You know, I've had a broadcast career

28
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.907 line:15% 
that has spanned 46 years,

29
00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:17.585
probably longer than some of you are even aged.

30
00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.415
And I've come across a lot of stories in my life,

31
00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:21.527
many stories indeed.

32
00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.977
I was one of the last reporters

33
00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.462
to chat with and interview Jimmy Hoffa

34
00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:27.589
before he disappeared.

35
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.716
Well, what we're going to talk with you about

36
00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:33.636
on this portion of Beyond Belief is disappearance,

37
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.221
but in a different kind of way.

38
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.015
David Paulides is our special guest,

39
00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:38.599
he's an author, researcher.

40
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.813
His book, Missing 411, is an incredible read

41
00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:47.233
of people that have disappeared from parks,

42
00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.738
Federal Parks, State Parks and certain other spots,

43
00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:53.615
with an amazing story, David.

44
00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.783
Absolutely riveting.

45
00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:56.159
But welcome to Beyond Belief.

46
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.735
<v ->Thanks for havin' me, George.</v>

47
00:01:57.735 --> 00:01:59.954
<v ->When you got into this,</v>

48
00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:01.967
there must of been one or two case studies

49
00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.124
that first cropped up that got you to say

50
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.212
hey, there's somethin' weird here, I'm gonna study this.

51
00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.245
How'd that happen for you?

52
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.208 line:15% 
<v ->Well originally we got a,</v>

53
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:13.759 line:15% 
I got a notification from a National Park Ranger

54
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.224 line:15% 
that he had worked at a series of National Parks

55
00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:19.557 line:15% 
and they had an unusual amount of disappearances

56
00:02:19.557 --> 00:02:21.894 line:15% 
and the people had disappeared in unusual places,

57
00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:25.104 line:15% 
that really didn't make a lot of sense to this person.

58
00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:26.814
And over the years they tried to do a little research

59
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.983
and figure out what happened,

60
00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:31.277
and they got stymied.

61
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:32.987
And the more they looked into it,

62
00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:35.649
into their internal system,

63
00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.244
he got concerned that there wasn't enough being done.

64
00:02:39.244 --> 00:02:42.330
And eventually ended up contacting me

65
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.250
when I was at a park doing some peripheral research,

66
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.836
and we started to look into disappearances

67
00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:50.755
in the US National Park system.

68
00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:53.756
Probably the first case that brought my interest

69
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:58.144
was a case of Stacy Arras that disappeared in Yosemite.

70
00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.516
A 14 year-old girl that was on a pack train ride

71
00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:05.894
into Sunrise Lakes, into the High Sierra area of Yosemite.

72
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:09.097
Her and her dad stopped at a series of cabins,

73
00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:11.442
she got off her horse, freshened up.

74
00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:14.238
And her and a 70 year-old man named Stuart,

75
00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:16.489
went and took a short walk off to this bluff,

76
00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.741
and she brought her camera and they were gonna

77
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.492
just take pictures.

78
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:22.328
The trail hand saw them walk over there

79
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:25.373
and she walked away from Stuart and told Stuart

80
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:26.741
she was gonna walk down to a lake

81
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.585
to take some pictures.

82
00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.837
And the trail hand and Stuart saw her walk down there,

83
00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:33.924
and that was the last time she was ever seen.

84
00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:37.084
Subsequent search found the lens cap to her camera

85
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:40.721
right inside the treeline of that area,

86
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.807
but the reality is, is they never found

87
00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:45.017
a trace of her after that.

88
00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:47.103
I filed a series of Freedom of Information Act requests

89
00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:50.399
against the Park Service to get documents,

90
00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:51.941
and I have received documents before

91
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:55.403
from the Park Service on other missing persons cases.

92
00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:57.072
I got a call from their attorney asking me

93
00:03:57.072 --> 00:03:59.198
why I wanted the case.

94
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:03.494
And then they asked me what I was gonna do with it.

95
00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.676
And finally a Special Agent from the Park Service,

96
00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:11.044
a guy named Yu, told me I would never get that case.

97
00:04:11.044 --> 00:04:12.586
He didn't explain why,

98
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.547
but he said "You're never gonna get it."

99
00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:17.542
<v ->Why do you think it was so secretive?</v>

100
00:04:17.542 --> 00:04:18.468
<v ->Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense</v>

101
00:04:18.468 --> 00:04:20.929
because the Park Service is a big bureaucracy

102
00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:24.056
and I'm sure that they have policies and procedures,

103
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:26.350
and depending on which park you call on,

104
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.477
or you make the request through,

105
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.897
you'll get reports on missing people.

106
00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:33.482
And a missing person's case isn't a criminal case,

107
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.600
it's a missing person.

108
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.445
And most agencies want publicity

109
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:39.489
about missing people.

110
00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:40.398
It appears that the Park Service

111
00:04:40.398 --> 00:04:42.950
doesn't want publicity about their missing people.

112
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.777
<v ->Scare people from going to the parks, right?</v>

113
00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:47.613
<v ->I think it might.</v>

114
00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:52.502
And in this one instance, the Park failed to comply

115
00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:54.253
and said that I would never get this case

116
00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:56.964
and to this date I don't have that case.

117
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.675
<v ->That's bizarre.</v>

118
00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:00.635
Strictly bizarre.

119
00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:03.922
And there's no way that you can squeeze it out of somebody?

120
00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:05.723
<v ->You know, I've talked to family members of Stacy's,</v>

121
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:09.164
her mom and her dad have died,

122
00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.562
they are equally concerned.

123
00:05:10.562 --> 00:05:13.287
They've read my books, they've read the stories

124
00:05:13.287 --> 00:05:16.734
and they said that their dad had compiled

125
00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:19.445
a massive amount of documents.

126
00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:22.657
And he was concerned, and an uncle of their's called me

127
00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:23.700
and said the same thing,

128
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.077
and said it just didn't make sense.

129
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:27.162
There were a lot of rumors that

130
00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:28.746
A, she may have walked out of the park,

131
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.331
all of this was not true.

132
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.166
She completely disappeared.

133
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:33.668
<v ->Was the 70 year-old, the old guy,</v>

134
00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.837
was he a suspect for a while?

135
00:05:35.837 --> 00:05:38.214
<v ->No, because the trail hand just happened</v>

136
00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:40.424
to see her walk away from him at the time

137
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:43.010
from this rock outcropping they were sitting on.

138
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.054
So, I think he was cleared form the beginning.

139
00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:48.725
And they had found her tracks going into this lake area,

140
00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:52.100
inside this tree area, where they found the lens cap.

141
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.939
So, I think he was absolved and

142
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.848
when I talked to Agent Yu on the phone

143
00:05:56.848 --> 00:05:58.693
I asked him were there any suspects,

144
00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:01.195
is this continuing to be investigated?

145
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.293
He told me that no one's touched the case for years,

146
00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:05.283
there are no suspects and there's no way

147
00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:06.983
that it's gonna get turned into a criminal case

148
00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:08.286
as far as he knew.

149
00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:10.537
<v ->Are these case, David, all around the country</v>

150
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.541
or primarily in North America?

151
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:17.044
<v ->Originally we focused on just the United States.</v>

152
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:20.715
And slowly, as the word got out what we were doing,

153
00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:22.133
we started to get contacted from people

154
00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.010
from around the world.

155
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.429
And initially it came out of Canada

156
00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:28.890
that there were these additional cases.

157
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.058
And then the Canadian National Park system

158
00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.292
seems to fall into the same category

159
00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.929
as the US National Park system

160
00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.623
as far as the number of disappearances.

161
00:06:37.623 --> 00:06:39.735
To date in North America we've established

162
00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:42.792
52 clusters of missing people

163
00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:44.716
in National Parks and National Forests

164
00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:46.908
throughout North America.

165
00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:48.785
The biggest cluster in the world of missing people,

166
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.120
Yosemite National Park.

167
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.042
<v ->Are these disappearances also happening in cities</v>

168
00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:57.793
where you don't have parks?

169
00:06:57.793 --> 00:07:02.722
<v ->So, to this point we established a profile that</v>

170
00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.009
that is based upon hundreds and hundreds

171
00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.961
and hundreds of disappearances,

172
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:09.338
and thousands of reports that we've read

173
00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:11.140
about missing people.

174
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.552
So this profiling,

175
00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:16.462
it's a specific point we're looking for.

176
00:07:16.462 --> 00:07:20.846
Namely canines that are brought in can't find a scent.

177
00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:23.361
They disappear and there's nothing heard,

178
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.073
there's nothing seen, there's no abduction scenario.

179
00:07:27.073 --> 00:07:28.199
<v ->Footprints, nothing?</v>

180
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.616
<v ->Nothing.</v>

181
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.318
The people a lotta times

182
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:33.079
are walking with friends or parents

183
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:36.322
and they're either first in line or they're last in line

184
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.750
when they disappear.

185
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.778
And those people don't hear or see anything either.

186
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:42.633
<v ->You turn around and they're gone.</v>

187
00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:43.924
<v ->Exactly.</v>

188
00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:46.802
One of the specific scenarios that we get asked

189
00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:49.637
is that well, maybe it's an animal attack.

190
00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:51.098
So, in the search and rescue reports

191
00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:55.101
they bring in trackers, they bring professional people in,

192
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:56.811
and each one of those cases,

193
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.605
it's completely absolved that there isn't an animal attack.

194
00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:01.473
Because in an animal attack there's gonna be blood,

195
00:08:01.473 --> 00:08:02.859
there's gonna be hair, there's gonna be a scene--

196
00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:04.151
<v ->There's gonna be noise!</v>

197
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:05.727
You're gonna hear, animals don't attack

198
00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:07.155
and they're not quiet!

199
00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:08.645
<v ->No sir.</v>

200
00:08:08.645 --> 00:08:09.574
And there's gonna be drag marks

201
00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:11.158
where the body would get dragged somewhere.

202
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:12.327
<v George>Precisely.</v>

203
00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:14.036
<v ->This has never been seen.</v>

204
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:16.538
Not in the cases that we'll work.

205
00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.083
It's true, people are attacked by animals,

206
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:21.085
I don't doubt that and I know for a fact that that's true.

207
00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:22.870
In these cases, we won't work a case

208
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.299
where there's an animal attack.

209
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:27.258
<v ->I know chatting with you on our radio show,</v>

210
00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:28.718
Coast to Coast AM, David,

211
00:08:28.718 --> 00:08:30.970
that you don't like to speculate

212
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.973
on a specific reason or cause.

213
00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:36.976
But we're gonna throw out some possibilities

214
00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:38.811
and let our viewers, of course,

215
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.981
make up their own minds about something like this.

216
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:43.566
But let me ask you,

217
00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:47.079
would you consider these disappearances

218
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:50.727
to be natural,

219
00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:53.557
or highly unusual?

220
00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:56.120
Sounds like I'm trying to trap you here. (laughs)

221
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.289
<v ->I'll do one better, extremely unusual.</v>

222
00:08:58.289 --> 00:08:59.581
<v George>Extremely unusual.</v>

223
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.418
<v ->They don't fit the normal disappearance scenario.</v>

224
00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:03.779
When you talk to,

225
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.353
in 2012 I made a presentation in front of the

226
00:09:06.353 --> 00:09:09.300
National Association of Search and Rescue Professionals,

227
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.887
and nobody left the room for the entire time I talked.

228
00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:14.764
They were stunned at some of the things--

229
00:09:14.764 --> 00:09:17.266
<v ->I get emails when you're on Coast to Coast,</v>

230
00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:21.187
and I have had thousands of guests,

231
00:09:21.187 --> 00:09:23.148
when you're on the program,

232
00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:25.900
my emails start going up, up, up,

233
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.778
and then afterward, the next day,

234
00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:33.616
it's clogged with people petrified, confused,

235
00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:36.409
desperate for more information.

236
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.956
It's one of the strangest stories I've ever heard, David.

237
00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.367
<v ->Well, and I think when you get into</v>

238
00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:48.298
the minutia of the data, it gets even stranger.

239
00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:51.290
Because the same scenario

240
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.700
of missing person to missing person

241
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.922
plays out over and over and over again.

242
00:09:56.922 --> 00:09:58.725
You'll read in the paper sometimes

243
00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:01.922
about small children that disappear,

244
00:10:01.922 --> 00:10:04.847
and they're found thousands of feet

245
00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:06.774
above where they disappeared.

246
00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:09.735
And search and rescue people won't say it publicly,

247
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:10.749
but privately they'll say

248
00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:12.411
"There's no way that kid got there on his own."

249
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.660
<v ->Alive or dead?</v>

250
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.202
<v ->90% of the time somebody that young, they're deceased.</v>

251
00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:17.827
<v George>They are?</v>

252
00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:19.119
<v ->Yes.</v>

253
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.789
But those search and rescue people privately,

254
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:25.592
they know that no two year-old can walk up a mountainside.

255
00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:26.501
<v ->There's no way.</v>

256
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:30.590
Now, of the people that are found alive,

257
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.926
the small number, are they in shock?

258
00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:36.387
Do they talk about, you know, I wandered away

259
00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:39.923
and I got lost, what do they say?

260
00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:42.851
<v ->So, part of that profiling is understanding</v>

261
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.312
the personality of the person

262
00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:46.856
or the background of the person who disappeared.

263
00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:50.804
And many, many times, the people that disappear

264
00:10:50.804 --> 00:10:52.897
have some type of disability.

265
00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:56.026
Whether it's autism, dementia,

266
00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:58.315
inability to speak...

267
00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:00.703
<v ->An astronomical percentage?</v>

268
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:01.578
<v David>Yes.</v>

269
00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.579
<v ->Very strange.</v>

270
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.165
<v ->It is very strange.</v>

271
00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:06.115
And when those people are found,

272
00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:07.418
and they are found at a higher percentage

273
00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:09.878
than the people that can speak,

274
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.547
those people obviously can't tell a story.

275
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.042
There have been instances where

276
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:19.128
people have disappeared and they are found.

277
00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:20.598
And most recently, a couple years ago,

278
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.140
a woman disappeared,

279
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.843
I believe it was in Arkansas,

280
00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:25.602
and she was eventually found and she said

281
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.480
for three days I knew that there were people

282
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.725
behind bushes that were watching me the entire time.

283
00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:33.153
And they didn't help me,

284
00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:34.195
and I walked up to 'em sometimes

285
00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:35.478
and tried to talk to 'em,

286
00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:37.448
but they wouldn't talk to me.

287
00:11:37.448 --> 00:11:39.868
And she said it was, she was very scared.

288
00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:41.285
And they interviewed a doctor about it and he said,

289
00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:42.953
"No, she wasn't makin' this up,

290
00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:44.581
"She believes that that happened."

291
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:45.915
<v ->What kinda people were they?</v>

292
00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:48.563
<v ->That's a great question, I don't know.</v>

293
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.463
<v ->I know deep down inside,</v>

294
00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:54.423
you've got some speculation here.

295
00:11:54.423 --> 00:11:58.652
Is it difficult for you not to just say, I think it's this?

296
00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:00.691
<v ->You know George, I can't,</v>

297
00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:02.723
I can't describe that I'm an expert

298
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.258
in all of these different fields

299
00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:06.259
that people have come at me with.

300
00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:10.981
And there's probably been eight different hypotheses

301
00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:13.483
and almost thesis-length form,

302
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.319
that people have written to me about,

303
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.405
explaining why they believe that it--

304
00:12:17.405 --> 00:12:18.532
<v George>That it was this thing, yeah.</v>

305
00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:19.531
<v ->Exactly.</v>

306
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:24.064
And they come at it with emotion and interest.

307
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.874
I can't say no to any of 'em.

308
00:12:27.874 --> 00:12:30.524
And if you want me to go through the list, glad to.

309
00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:32.540
<v ->Yeah, let's do that.</v>

310
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.755
What we're talking about here folks, again,

311
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:39.677
missing people primarily in forests and parks,

312
00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:44.140
State or Federal, that are simply gone.

313
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.852
In your guess, how many people are we talking about

314
00:12:47.852 --> 00:12:50.896
since this phenomena has come under your wrap?

315
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:53.232
<v ->So, we've identified 1600 cases.</v>

316
00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:54.984
<v George>1600 people?</v>

317
00:12:54.984 --> 00:12:56.152
<v ->But you gotta remember that the</v>

318
00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:58.822
National Parks and the US National Forest Service

319
00:12:58.822 --> 00:13:00.823
isn't helping us or assisting us,

320
00:13:00.823 --> 00:13:01.949
because they won't tell us--

321
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.785
<v ->So, you're sayin' 1600 reported cases.</v>

322
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:05.652
<v David>That we know of.</v>

323
00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:06.704
<v ->That we know of.</v>

324
00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:08.414
Okay, let's go through the scenarios

325
00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:11.491
of the possibilities what could be happening.

326
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:15.293
From the logical to the illogical.

327
00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:17.966
<v ->So, start at the most mundane,</v>

328
00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:19.175
people have stated that

329
00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:23.029
well, there must be a group of

330
00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:24.972
American soldiers out there

331
00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.297
that are kidnapping these people

332
00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:28.553
and our government's doing tests on 'em.

333
00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:33.138
I've heard that 50 times in the last five years.

334
00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:34.638
That scenario to me doesn't make a lotta sense

335
00:13:34.638 --> 00:13:37.318
because canines would be able to track that.

336
00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:39.529
<v George>Right, people would hear it.</v>

337
00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:41.507
Somebody would see it.

338
00:13:41.507 --> 00:13:45.037
<v ->Eventually, yeah for sure.</v>

339
00:13:45.047 --> 00:13:47.119
Something I really know nothing about is

340
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:49.412
people say that there's reptilians out there,

341
00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.706
and that reptilians are in the woods

342
00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:52.082
taking these people and feeding off 'em.

343
00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.931
<v ->Extraterrestrials.</v>

344
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:58.798
<v ->Or ultraterrestrials and they're here living in,</v>

345
00:13:58.798 --> 00:14:00.375
some people have stated that they live underground,

346
00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.667
I don't know.

347
00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.428
Obviously, there's the alien connection

348
00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:06.555
that I've heard 10,000 times.

349
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:09.581
<v ->Do people see craft around some of these scenes?</v>

350
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:10.851
<v David>That's never been reported.</v>

351
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.162
<v ->Okay.</v>

352
00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:17.107
<v ->But one thing that people do say is that,</v>

353
00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.401
in conjunction with these disappearances,

354
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.321
immediately after or right after,

355
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:25.324
part of that profile is that there's bad weather

356
00:14:25.324 --> 00:14:26.367
associated with this.

357
00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:28.035
Meaning, in many of these cases,

358
00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.829
sometimes it rains inches and inches

359
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:32.114
or snows feet and feet in days right afterwards.

360
00:14:32.114 --> 00:14:33.874
<v George>Kinda wipes out the scene, doesn't it?</v>

361
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.250
<v ->It does.</v>

362
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.004
And so, aliens, alien abduction,

363
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.707
that's a really common one.

364
00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:45.251
Another one that I've heard a lot from Europe

365
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:48.848
and Iceland, is fairies.

366
00:14:48.848 --> 00:14:50.349
<v ->Fairies.</v>

367
00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:52.158
<v David>Fairies and little people.</v>

368
00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:52.851
<v ->Uh huh.</v>

369
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:56.313
<v ->And I've actually written about that in some of my books</v>

370
00:14:56.313 --> 00:15:00.197
because the folklore mythology that surrounds it

371
00:15:00.197 --> 00:15:02.069
talks about them abducting people.

372
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.164
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

373
00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:04.864
Ancient folklore.

374
00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:06.866
<v David>Yes.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

375
00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:11.846
<v David>And then another one is that there's gods</v>

376
00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:14.250
and the gods at times

377
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.990
take people for their own will.

378
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.422
And part of that taking of them is that

379
00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:23.666
if they don't fit the eventual needs of those Gods

380
00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:25.802
they're replaced back on earth

381
00:15:25.802 --> 00:15:27.220
and those are the ones we find deceased.

382
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.750
I've heard that probably 200 times.

383
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.291
The other one that

384
00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:37.511
a lot of people may think is true

385
00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:38.932
is that there's a group

386
00:15:38.932 --> 00:15:42.652
of serial killers out there in the woods.

387
00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:45.153
To me that is the least likely of every scenario,

388
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.131
not that I'm categorizing anything but

389
00:15:48.131 --> 00:15:49.783
the reason being is that in these searches

390
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.952
they bring in professional trackers.

391
00:15:51.952 --> 00:15:54.330
Part of that professional tracking ability is

392
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.457
tracking somebody through the woods.

393
00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:57.583
And some of the people they use

394
00:15:57.583 --> 00:16:01.045
are Navajo trackers, military trackers,

395
00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:04.152
professional private trackers in conjunction with canines.

396
00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:05.049
<v ->And nothing!</v>

397
00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:06.040
<v ->Nothing.</v>

398
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.885
They don't find tracks leaving the scene,

399
00:16:07.885 --> 00:16:09.637
they don't find a scent.

400
00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:12.048
Some idea, or the idea that people promote

401
00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:14.183
that it's a serial killer in the woods,

402
00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:15.934
there's a lot of things that go with that,

403
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:19.388
And mainly, if there was a serial killer in the woods,

404
00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:23.143
then they'd have to carry that body for miles.

405
00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:26.077
<v ->When they track, do they get to a certain point</v>

406
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:28.280
and it just ends?

407
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.657
<v ->Sometimes it ends immediately</v>

408
00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:30.866
and sometimes they do get to that point

409
00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.910
and the scent just stops.

410
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.412
A lot of times some of the best canine trackers in the world

411
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.366
have said that they'll bring the dog to the scene

412
00:16:38.366 --> 00:16:40.334
and the dog will walk in a circle,

413
00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:42.545
lay down and doesn't wanna track.

414
00:16:42.545 --> 00:16:43.702
<v ->He's scared?</v>

415
00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.547
<v ->Well, the description from some of the searchers</v>

416
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.924
is that they can't tell if the dog is uninterested

417
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.146
or there is no search.

418
00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.839
<v ->What about Big Foot?</v>

419
00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:54.264
<v ->That's another scenario that's been brought up</v>

420
00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:59.020
hundreds and hundreds of times and I would say that

421
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.104
the issue with that one is the same with the others

422
00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.190
in that there's no tracks.

423
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.819
And if you were gonna carry somebody,

424
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.739
drag somebody,

425
00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:12.449
I think you would hear something on the front end--

426
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:13.617
<v ->You would think.</v>

427
00:17:13.617 --> 00:17:15.160
<v David>Of something unusual.</v>

428
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.330
<v ->What about a portal, another dimension?</v>

429
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.750
Some kind of, God knows what, that is going on

430
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.086
in this planet, this universe, and that these people

431
00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:27.297
just accidentally walk right through it

432
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:30.175
and they're gone and they can't get back.

433
00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.887
<v ->Well, in all of the scenarios,</v>

434
00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.547
in what's been explained to me

435
00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:36.973
by other experts that have been on your show,

436
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.949
to me that one, if it exists,

437
00:17:39.949 --> 00:17:42.304
would be the one that fit every scenario

438
00:17:42.304 --> 00:17:44.023
that we've explained in the book.

439
00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:45.649
Not that I'm saying that is it,

440
00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:48.569
I'm just saying that the scenario the experts lay out

441
00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:52.990
seems to be the one that fits the most criteria.

442
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.051
As an example, there was a hunter in Colorado

443
00:17:57.051 --> 00:17:59.153
that contacted me a couple years ago.

444
00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:00.497
And he was hunting for elk at about

445
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:03.501
10 or 11,000 feet up in Northern Colorado.

446
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:06.328
And he said he was walking on a plain

447
00:18:06.328 --> 00:18:08.631
where the grass was maybe four feet high,

448
00:18:08.631 --> 00:18:10.298
three or four feet,

449
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.092
and he heard something coming towards him

450
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.053
and he couldn't really identify it.

451
00:18:14.053 --> 00:18:15.721
And he kept walking, he got on a trail

452
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:18.131
and he kept hearing a loud hum.

453
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:20.468
And he started to slow down on the trail,

454
00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:23.528
and he said in front of him it became real blurry.

455
00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:24.471
<v George>Whoa!</v>

456
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.064
<v ->So, he slowed down even more.</v>

457
00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.148
<v George>Like an opening.</v>

458
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.892
<v ->Something, he said it was almost like</v>

459
00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:31.153
you were looking through glasses that weren't yours

460
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.363
and it was just strange looking.

461
00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:34.606
And he said he almost walked up to it,

462
00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:35.950
and it looked like a plate of glass

463
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.297
and he stuck his foot through

464
00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:39.127
and part of his foot disappeared.

465
00:18:39.127 --> 00:18:41.456
And he said, I brought my foot back

466
00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:44.332
and I turned around and I ran.

467
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.562
That's the first time I've heard that.

468
00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:48.671
But I suppose, what would happen to ya

469
00:18:48.671 --> 00:18:49.671
if you had your head down

470
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.216
and you weren't payin' attention?

471
00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:52.799
I don't know.

472
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:53.800
<v ->That's a good point.</v>

473
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.803
You're working on a documentary, tell me about it.

474
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.682
<v ->So, several years ago we got a series of inquiries</v>

475
00:18:59.682 --> 00:19:02.540
from different groups about doing a documentary and

476
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.033
one of the things that I would have to give up

477
00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:08.607
was editorial control and accuracy of the documentary.

478
00:19:08.607 --> 00:19:10.275
They would've wanted to dramatize it,

479
00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.277
one thing I didn't wanna do.

480
00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.654
I was able to put together a team,

481
00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:15.963
an award-winning team of journalists,

482
00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:18.033
film makers, videographers.

483
00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.821
And I've worked with them now for the last six months

484
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:23.581
in getting to the point we are today.

485
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:25.456
And we put together the trailer.

486
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:26.709
We've been to National Parks.

487
00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:28.917
We've interviewed victim's families.

488
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:32.255
And we've interviewed former National Park Rangers,

489
00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:34.499
and current National Park Rangers.

490
00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:37.678
And I can tell you I have learned so much

491
00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:40.888
riveting information about the Park Service

492
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:44.185
and from the victims about how they're treated.

493
00:19:44.185 --> 00:19:48.229
And I think that part of this story is the victim's story,

494
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:52.684
their grief, how quickly they've disappeared.

495
00:19:52.684 --> 00:19:56.238
How once that seven to 10 day period of search, George,

496
00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:59.108
is over, that's it.

497
00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:00.867
Nobody wants to talk about it.

498
00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:03.745
Nobody wants to post the disappearance.

499
00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.248
Nobody wants to explain the circumstances.

500
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:06.999
It's over.

501
00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:08.583
<v ->It is over.</v>

502
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.794
<v ->So, we started a Kickstarter campaign,</v>

503
00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:13.296
we're tryin' to raise the needed money

504
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.804
and we really need everybody's help to make that happen.

505
00:20:15.804 --> 00:20:17.709
<v ->Kickstarter has helped a lot of people I know</v>

506
00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:19.928
raise money for films and projects like that.

507
00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.773
First of all, if people wanna watch the trailer,

508
00:20:22.773 --> 00:20:24.299
where do they find it?

509
00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:26.175 line:15% 
<v ->Kickstarter.com.</v>

510
00:20:26.175 --> 00:20:28.562 line:15% 
Missing 411, you go to our website

511
00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:31.515 line:15% 
canammissing.com, it's on there.

512
00:20:31.515 --> 00:20:33.663
<v ->In a lot of these cases,</v>

513
00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:35.763
you find strange cases

514
00:20:35.763 --> 00:20:38.833
where the clothes,

515
00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:40.908
it's just laid out but it's not attacked,

516
00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.993
it's not ripped, it's not torn.

517
00:20:42.993 --> 00:20:45.371
It's almost as if somebody would take it off,

518
00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:49.040
lie it down and they're still gone, right?

519
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.631
<v ->It's just not the clothes, it's also shoes.</v>

520
00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:56.799
I have several cases where searchers found

521
00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:59.551
the people's clothes neatly folded.

522
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.846
One time they were neatly folded in the middle of a river.

523
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.097
Now one of the constants is

524
00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.605
is that many of these people are found

525
00:21:06.605 --> 00:21:11.097
either in, next to, or adjoining a dry creek bed,

526
00:21:11.097 --> 00:21:15.253
boulder field, lake, reservoir.

527
00:21:16.393 --> 00:21:21.198
And many times they're found deceased without clothes,

528
00:21:21.198 --> 00:21:22.200
without shoes, without--

529
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200
<v George>No marks on their body.</v>

530
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.754
<v ->Other than the one that killed 'em,</v>

531
00:21:25.754 --> 00:21:28.076
maybe a head injury and that's it.

532
00:21:28.076 --> 00:21:29.790
<v George>So there are some injuries to some?</v>

533
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.573
<v ->Oh yeah, in the deceased ones, yes.</v>

534
00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:36.227
<v ->What percent, David, would you think</v>

535
00:21:36.227 --> 00:21:38.591
could be just a natural cause?

536
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:42.358
Somebody wandered off, got lost,

537
00:21:42.358 --> 00:21:47.307
fell, hit their head, something like that?

538
00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:48.809
Small percent?

539
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:52.475
<v ->Honestly, I think we vetted that completely.</v>

540
00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:55.357
There is no need for me to put fluff in the books

541
00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.402
because there's just too many stories out there.

542
00:21:58.402 --> 00:21:59.528
I mean, before we did this interview

543
00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:01.821
I was talkin' to you about a series of stories

544
00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.260
that have happened just in the last six months.

545
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.484
And in my books I've written in the last two years,

546
00:22:07.484 --> 00:22:10.039
that there seems to be some type of acceleration

547
00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:12.375
in the type of these cases that match

548
00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:15.027
the profile we established.

549
00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:18.255
<v ->This is scary stuff.</v>

550
00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:22.259
As you were doing your research,

551
00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:25.228
did anything shock you?

552
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.274
<v ->One of the things in the last two years that we found</v>

553
00:22:29.274 --> 00:22:31.268
that to me is very shocking,

554
00:22:31.268 --> 00:22:34.187
is the number of high intellectual types

555
00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:38.267
that have disappeared in just the last two years.

556
00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:42.159
Unexplained, never found.

557
00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:43.613
One off the top of my head,

558
00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.533
Alyof Krost, K-R-O-S-T,

559
00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:49.360
he disappeared in the mountains above Los Angeles.

560
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.537
He was at Lake Arrowhead

561
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.373
attending a conference of physicists.

562
00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:56.460
And they had an outing one afternoon,

563
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.754
where they went to take a hike.

564
00:22:58.754 --> 00:23:03.081
And during that hike, Alyof didn't feel real good.

565
00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:06.878
And he and another of the escorts both didn't feel good,

566
00:23:06.878 --> 00:23:10.140
so they sat down and the rest of the group took off.

567
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.727
And again, it's that last in line, first in line scenario.

568
00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:15.270
So, the group leaves.

569
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.994
And if anyone's ever been to Lake Arrowhead,

570
00:23:16.994 --> 00:23:21.421
this is extremely rural, there's a lot out there.

571
00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:24.228
But there's a trail, lotta boulders.

572
00:23:24.228 --> 00:23:27.533
The group eventually made it back to the conference center,

573
00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:28.983
he never made it back.

574
00:23:28.983 --> 00:23:30.984
And there was a huge search.

575
00:23:30.984 --> 00:23:32.412
Never been found.

576
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:34.331
And there's been a series of physicists

577
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:37.041
around North America and the world

578
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.753
that have disappeared in the rural areas

579
00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:41.863
under very, very unusual circumstances.

580
00:23:41.863 --> 00:23:43.339
<v George>How bizarre.</v>

581
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:46.154
<v ->Also, physicians are another one</v>

582
00:23:46.154 --> 00:23:47.635
that have either disappeared

583
00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.919
and have been later found under

584
00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:52.133
highly unusual circumstances, dead,

585
00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.351
or they were never found.

586
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.262
<v ->Of those who are not found,</v>

587
00:23:56.262 --> 00:23:58.522
is it possible that they're being used

588
00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:02.025
for their expertise somewhere?

589
00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:05.059
I mean, if you're gonna grab a bunch of physicists,

590
00:24:05.059 --> 00:24:07.614
to me logic would tell you,

591
00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.200
you, this group, whoever's taking them

592
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.607
needs a physicist.

593
00:24:13.537 --> 00:24:16.790
<v ->So I've had, again, hundreds of emails about this.</v>

594
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.459
And there's a lot of theories that have been thrown at me,

595
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:22.337
and one of 'em is something, someone's

596
00:24:22.337 --> 00:24:24.297
trying to eliminate the intellect of the world.

597
00:24:24.297 --> 00:24:26.008
<v George>How would they know?</v>

598
00:24:26.008 --> 00:24:27.301
<v ->There's the million dollar question.</v>

599
00:24:27.301 --> 00:24:29.178
Now Krost was not just a physicist,

600
00:24:29.178 --> 00:24:31.797
he taught at one of the top universities in Germany.

601
00:24:31.797 --> 00:24:34.182
So, he was a real intellect.

602
00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:37.018
And there's been several of those kind.

603
00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:39.854
There was a guy that was a physicist

604
00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:41.815
for a Canadian research firm,

605
00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:42.983
way up in the middle of nowhere,

606
00:24:42.983 --> 00:24:45.194
he disappeared in the middle of the night.

607
00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:48.171
And there are these stories

608
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:50.432
that seem to

609
00:24:50.432 --> 00:24:54.744
all center around intellect, which are discomforting.

610
00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:59.040
<v ->Yet, when they come across children with deficiencies,</v>

611
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.244
they seem to leave them alone.

612
00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:06.256
<v ->Yes, it would appear that the ones</v>

613
00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:09.092
that couldn't talk about it,

614
00:25:09.092 --> 00:25:11.512
are the ones that make it.

615
00:25:11.512 --> 00:25:14.055
But occasionally, even they don't make it back,

616
00:25:14.055 --> 00:25:17.184
and that's the perplexing scenario.

617
00:25:17.184 --> 00:25:20.645
And I'm talkin', again another part of that scenario

618
00:25:20.645 --> 00:25:23.765
is that the victims are found later

619
00:25:23.765 --> 00:25:28.134
in areas that sometimes had been searched hundreds of times.

620
00:25:28.134 --> 00:25:30.322
And all of a sudden they are there!

621
00:25:30.322 --> 00:25:32.573
And sometimes it's just a body.

622
00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:37.000
<v ->You mentioned the alien possibilities,</v>

623
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.157
yet minimal reports of craft being seen.

624
00:25:41.157 --> 00:25:44.753
What if these higher intelligent beings

625
00:25:44.753 --> 00:25:47.302
have the capability

626
00:25:47.302 --> 00:25:49.922
of teleporting an individual

627
00:25:49.922 --> 00:25:54.220
almost with an instant, from above,

628
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.015
so high up you don't see the craft.

629
00:25:57.015 --> 00:25:58.976
You don't see the lights.

630
00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:01.519
Yet, they beam in on David Paulides,

631
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:04.648
George Noory, they see them walking there in the forest,

632
00:26:04.648 --> 00:26:07.646
then just (snaps fingers) they're up, they're gone.

633
00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:08.991
Maybe?

634
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:15.281
And they're taking people of certain educational standards.

635
00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.536
<v ->Well George, if they could do that,</v>

636
00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:19.473
this show'd go to number one, I'm tellin' ya. (laughs)

637
00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:21.519
<v George>We'd be gone!</v>

638
00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:24.627
We'll come back from a break and you'll be gone, right?

639
00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:26.686
But it's frightening!

640
00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:27.963
<v ->If that scenario could play out</v>

641
00:26:27.963 --> 00:26:31.258
that's very frightening because again,

642
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:32.669
as I've been told many times,

643
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:34.678
that's the scenario in many people's minds

644
00:26:34.678 --> 00:26:35.887
that's being worked out.

645
00:26:35.887 --> 00:26:38.890
<v ->Can you imagine the horror for a moment</v>

646
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.060
of all these people who have disappeared

647
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.304
of what they actually witnessed?

648
00:26:44.304 --> 00:26:47.934
Before this disappearance, before they died.

649
00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.861
It's got to be frightening.

650
00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:53.780
Assuming they saw it coming.

651
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.318
<v ->Well, one of the things I talk about,</v>

652
00:26:55.318 --> 00:26:56.533
especially the young kids,

653
00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:59.035
is that right after they've been,

654
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:01.246
search and rescue has found them in many instances,

655
00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:03.617
there's a cameraman nearby.

656
00:27:03.617 --> 00:27:07.293
And one of the disturbing things that I see in all of 'em

657
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:08.795
is that their eyes are like

658
00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:10.714
the size of dishpans in their head.

659
00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:11.630
<v George>In shock?</v>

660
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.468
<v ->Shock and just staring out at you like, wow!</v>

661
00:27:15.468 --> 00:27:17.471
<v ->Do they talk to you?</v>

662
00:27:17.471 --> 00:27:18.555
<v ->The search and rescue people</v>

663
00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:21.300
don't ever report any conversation.

664
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.259
And I don't know if that's just

665
00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:25.728
their professional etiquette or not.

666
00:27:25.728 --> 00:27:28.523
<v ->I mean I would probably come back and say</v>

667
00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:29.649
oh, you're not gonna believe this,

668
00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:32.944
I saw this group of people like grab me

669
00:27:32.944 --> 00:27:35.783
and I got away, or something!

670
00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:38.991
You had mentioned earlier that another possibility

671
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:43.530
might have been beings, human or otherwise,

672
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.659
in caverns and caves and things like that.

673
00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:50.254
Are there a lot of caverns and caves in these locations?

674
00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:52.485
<v ->I think there are,</v>

675
00:27:52.485 --> 00:27:54.091
I've been told that especially Yosemite

676
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:55.708
and Sequoia National Park there's

677
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:57.501
hundreds and hundreds of them.

678
00:27:57.501 --> 00:27:59.262
Again, I've been told this and I don't know this for sure,

679
00:27:59.262 --> 00:28:02.932
that there's a cave system that runs park to park.

680
00:28:02.932 --> 00:28:04.092
So, in that area for sure.

681
00:28:04.092 --> 00:28:07.752
There's a story I wrote about where a small boy,

682
00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:10.566
three years-old, it was up near Mount Shasta,

683
00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.609
and he was camping with his grandma and grandpa

684
00:28:12.609 --> 00:28:15.528
and parents, he disappeared.

685
00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:18.198
And he was gone for about 12 hours.

686
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:19.449
The boy came back and told a story

687
00:28:19.449 --> 00:28:22.493
that he was held in an underground cavern

688
00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:26.331
and there were robots in the room.

689
00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:28.375
and that somebody that looked like grandma

690
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:30.460
was talking care of him.

691
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.964
And he said that he thought it was grandma

692
00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:37.679
until he saw sparks comin' out of her head.

693
00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:40.887
And that he had seen old-time guns and things

694
00:28:40.887 --> 00:28:44.933
on a ledge around the outside of the cavern.

695
00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:46.434
So, searchers search this area

696
00:28:46.434 --> 00:28:48.590
for hours and hours and hours,

697
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.105
walkin' the same trail in and out, in and out.

698
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:52.316
And what do they do?

699
00:28:52.316 --> 00:28:53.525
They walk the same trail again

700
00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:56.570
and he's just sittin' in a bush right next to the trail.

701
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.480
It's one of those strange instances where

702
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.909
the boy actually came back and told a story.

703
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:05.569
<v ->How far back were you able to trace the disappearance,</v>

704
00:29:05.569 --> 00:29:07.330
as to what time period?

705
00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.998
<v ->1752.</v>

706
00:29:08.998 --> 00:29:10.787
<v George>Wow, so it goes back that far?</v>

707
00:29:10.787 --> 00:29:11.845
<v ->Yeah.
<v George>At least.</v>

708
00:29:11.845 --> 00:29:13.489
<v David>At least.</v>

709
00:29:14.129 --> 00:29:16.122
<v ->Native American legend?</v>

710
00:29:16.122 --> 00:29:18.216
<v ->There's a,</v>

711
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:20.417
well so, originally we started in the United States,

712
00:29:20.417 --> 00:29:23.139
went to Canada and again

713
00:29:23.139 --> 00:29:26.057
the more notoriety your show is givin' these stories

714
00:29:26.057 --> 00:29:27.892
and other media outlets,

715
00:29:27.892 --> 00:29:29.853
people from around the world have said

716
00:29:29.853 --> 00:29:32.273
hey, we heard that profile

717
00:29:32.273 --> 00:29:34.266
and we wanna send you this story.

718
00:29:34.266 --> 00:29:38.010
And so now we have eight countries involved

719
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.365
and I'm guessing, George, there's many more.

720
00:29:41.365 --> 00:29:45.734
But yeah, eight countries,

721
00:29:46.244 --> 00:29:49.954
1600 people and I always talk to Native Americans.

722
00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:51.374
I'm one of these people,

723
00:29:51.374 --> 00:29:53.585
I spent 50% of my life a few years ago

724
00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:56.128
on the Hoopa Reservation in Northern California.

725
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.423
And I always listen to 'em.

726
00:29:58.423 --> 00:30:01.167
I learned to pay attention to what they say.

727
00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:03.094
<v ->This is, David, and I've gotta tell you,</v>

728
00:30:03.094 --> 00:30:06.099
in my career as a broadcaster,

729
00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:08.511
the most riveting,

730
00:30:08.511 --> 00:30:11.841
scary story I have ever heard.

731
00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:15.014
Scary because we can't control it.

732
00:30:15.014 --> 00:30:18.592
Riveting because we don't know what it is.

733
00:30:19.402 --> 00:30:20.813
<v ->I've heard that many times.</v>

734
00:30:20.813 --> 00:30:25.051
But I appreciate hearing it from you and the,

735
00:30:25.051 --> 00:30:27.577
almost those exact words were told to me by someone

736
00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:29.871
and said this is why the government's doing

737
00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:33.350
everything they can to block you

738
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.584
from getting the information.

739
00:30:34.584 --> 00:30:38.715
<v ->What does David Paulides do next in this area?</v>

740
00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:41.132
<v ->I think one of the things is I have to keep an open mind</v>

741
00:30:41.132 --> 00:30:44.302
and the people I work with have to keep that open mind.

742
00:30:44.302 --> 00:30:46.429
And you brought up the point about

743
00:30:46.429 --> 00:30:50.217
well, how do we know it's not happening in urban areas?

744
00:30:50.217 --> 00:30:53.269
And we're lookin' at that really hard right now.

745
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:55.020
And I think it's a good point

746
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.579
because I think if we restrict ourselves

747
00:30:58.579 --> 00:31:00.402
to that rural environment,

748
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.846
that we may be missing a big piece of the puzzle.

749
00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:06.258
<v ->Absolutely, because if you find out it's being,</v>

750
00:31:06.258 --> 00:31:09.703
it's happening in urban areas, too,

751
00:31:09.703 --> 00:31:12.324
then there are other scenarios involved.

752
00:31:12.324 --> 00:31:12.914
<v ->Exactly.</v>

753
00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:15.115
<v ->You can rule out animals, I would think,</v>

754
00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:17.085
and things like that.

755
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:19.421
<v ->One of the reasons that we restricted ourselves</v>

756
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.339
to the rural areas from the beginning

757
00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:24.592
is because that's where the information came from.

758
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:28.039
I think that also restricting it to the rural areas

759
00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:30.514
keeps a lot of the critics away that are saying

760
00:31:30.514 --> 00:31:34.143
well, this is just a normal human abduction and no big deal.

761
00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:38.481
And so, unless we can keep to this path of this profile,

762
00:31:38.481 --> 00:31:41.026
I'd be reluctant to step too deep into that muck

763
00:31:41.026 --> 00:31:44.445
just because people and others would

764
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:46.563
refute it on its faces saying

765
00:31:46.563 --> 00:31:48.524
well, it's a human abduction.

766
00:31:48.524 --> 00:31:51.286
So, I gotta be careful about how that plays out.

767
00:31:51.286 --> 00:31:53.996
<v ->We've had a lot of stories of human abductions</v>

768
00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:56.958
by extra-terrestrials where these people

769
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:59.211
are experimented on, they're probed,

770
00:31:59.211 --> 00:32:02.296
they're tested, they may have had hybrid babies.

771
00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:04.882
But they always seem to be dropped back off,

772
00:32:04.882 --> 00:32:06.752
given back to the planet.

773
00:32:06.752 --> 00:32:09.262
But what if there's a group of extra-terrestrials out there

774
00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:13.187
that keep them for whatever reason?

775
00:32:13.187 --> 00:32:16.019 line:15% 
That is scary.

776
00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:18.312 line:15% 
<v ->Boy, especially if you were a parent</v>

777
00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:20.055 line:15% 
and your two year-old disappeared

778
00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:22.149 line:15% 
when they were right in your midst.

779
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:24.527 line:15% 
And you never saw 'em again and you knew

780
00:32:24.527 --> 00:32:27.253 line:15% 
that your son or your daughter would never leave you,

781
00:32:27.253 --> 00:32:28.699 line:15% 
which I hear many times,

782
00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:30.700
and your son or daughter couldn't get outside

783
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.286
that two mile search perimeter,

784
00:32:33.286 --> 00:32:34.821
and they knew they weren't there.

785
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:37.141
So, where are they?

786
00:32:37.141 --> 00:32:38.791
I've said many times, I don't know

787
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:41.598
of a more horrific scenario as a parent

788
00:32:41.598 --> 00:32:43.675
than not knowing what happened and where your child--

789
00:32:43.675 --> 00:32:44.746
<v ->It's the worst.</v>

790
00:32:44.746 --> 00:32:45.788
<v ->It would be the worst.</v>

791
00:32:45.788 --> 00:32:48.385
<v ->David, thanks for bein' on Beyond Belief, appreciate it.</v>

792
00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:50.177
<v ->Thank you, George.</v>

793
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:53.549
<v ->No question, in my 46 years of broadcasting,</v>

794
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:57.131
it is the scariest story

795
00:32:57.131 --> 00:32:59.641
I have ever attempted to cover.

796
00:32:59.641 --> 00:33:03.357 line:15% 
David Paulides, thank God, is out there doing this research.

797
00:33:03.357 --> 00:33:05.443 line:15% 
Maybe one day we'll get the answer

798
00:33:05.443 --> 00:33:08.279 line:15% 
to what's happening to all these people.

799
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:11.017 line:15% 
Thanks for watching Beyond Belief.
