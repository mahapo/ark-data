00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.509 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.492 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be an
exciting show because we're

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:10%
dealing with one of my
favorite subjects-- Mars.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And with me, aerospace
engineer Robert Zubrin,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:90%
author of "A Case for Mars."

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I have been mesmerized
with this planet, Robert,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little boy.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I bet it was the same for you.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.766 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT ZUBRIN: Sure.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started
getting interested in space,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Was it the moon mission
that did it for you?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:90%
What really just catapulted you?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.265 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well,
actually, it was Sputnik.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ha ha.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: I was--

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '57?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.271 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's correct.

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I was five when Sputnik flew,
and I was an early reader.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
I was already reading
science fiction at that time.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And what Sputnik
did to me was say,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
this was going to be real,
that we were going into space.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And I just got totally into it.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I was nine
when Kennedy made his speech

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:90%
committing us to the moon.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But by then, I knew the
destination was Mars,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
because Mars is the planet
that has the resources

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.917 align:middle line:84%
to support life
and civilization.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's got that romance.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, authors
have been fascinated

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
with Mars and its history
and what might have happened.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
"War of the Worlds"
was all about Mars

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:90%
and the possibilities.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
What do you think that planet
looked like a long time ago?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, a
real long time ago,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Mars had oceans and
lakes and rivers.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:10%
We can see the
geological formations,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:10%
water erosion features
left behind by that Mars.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:10%
That's several
billion years ago.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:10%
Then what happened was Mars lost
its greenhouse effect allowed

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:10%
it to be warm enough
for liquid water,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:10%
and the planet went into deep
freeze where it still is today.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, life could
have evolved on Mars

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
in its earlier,
warm, wet period.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
There could still be life
underground on Mars today

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because Mars is
geologically active.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
There's liquid
water underground.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of life forms
in the Earth's groundwater.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:90%
There could be some in Mars'.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I think of life,
I want to think of creatures.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.379 align:middle line:90%
I want to think of humans.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to think of
all these things--

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:90%
turtles and frogs and fish.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But scientists are
excited about organisms

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that might be found
on another planet.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, sure.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, large creatures
and intelligent creatures

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
are more interesting
than microorganisms.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
microorganisms on Mars

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
would be very
interesting in itself.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Because right now we only
know about one planet

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:90%
that developed life.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
whether we were

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
a sure bet or a one
in a trillion chance.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If life developed on another
world in our own solar system

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
too, if two out of
two hit pay dirt,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that means that life
develops wherever

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
it has a decent planet or at
least with high probability.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And since we now know that
there are millions of planets,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.555 align:middle line:84%
that probably
planets around stars

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
are more the rule than
the exception-- that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.555 align:middle line:84%
what the Kepler Space
Telescope mission had proven.

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of billions
of planets in our galaxy.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If life happens wherever
you got a decent planet,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:90%
it means life is everywhere.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And since the whole
history of life on Earth

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
is one of development
from simpler forms to more

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
complex forms capable of
greater degrees of activity,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.867 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, and ever
more rapid evolution;

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
if life is everywhere, it
means intelligence everywhere.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.241 align:middle line:90%
It means we're not alone.

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:47.592 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we'll
find out by going Mars.

00:03:47.592 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if we don't find
intelligent life on Mars,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
if we find any
life on Mars, that

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
will show the
universe is inhabited.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.824 align:middle line:90%
The universe is alive.

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take the
religious applications

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:90%
out of this.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, it would seem
highly improbable

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that planet Earth was the
only planet with teeming life.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:90%
To me, the formula is the same.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
If you can find the planet with
water that's in its Goldilocks

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
zone to its star,
the chances are

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be the
same thing, I think.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: I agree.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The laws of science are
the same on the Earth

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
as they are elsewhere
in the universe.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.599 align:middle line:84%
If the laws of science were
conducive to the development

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
of life here, they'll be
conducive to development

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:90%
of life elsewhere.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The question is is
how probable is it?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we get two out of
two hits, that means that,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
well, certainly it's
better than a 50% shot.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a better
than 50% shot, given

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that most stars have planets,
it means when you're looking up

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
into the sky at night
and you're seeing

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
a million stars
above you, you're

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.764 align:middle line:84%
seeing a million
inhabited worlds.

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And all
of them probably,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
if they're intelligent, they're
seeking these same answers too,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I would assume.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are we?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.193 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Sure.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:10%
And actually, a Renaissance
thinker, Giordano Bruno,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:10%
came up against these very
same ideas in the late 1500s.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And he said, look,
you know, we're

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:10%
planets going around suns.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:90%
The stars are suns.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
have planets, too.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
inhabited, too.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And when people there look
up into the sky, they see us.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.505 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we are in heaven.

00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The church burned him at
the stake for saying that.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: But he was right.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Today-- today,
they wouldn't burn him.

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, they'd say, well,
you might be right,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to baptize
them or something like that.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
When you think of the
probabilities of life--

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're 4.5 billion
years old in a universe

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that's almost 14
billion years old.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's 9 and
1/2 billion years

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that there could be planetary
systems that jumpstarted ahead

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know in the evolutionary
scale of a planet's development

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
how long it takes.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:84%
If it took us 4 and
1/2 billion years

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to form in a universe that
was 14 billion years old,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
could there be
civilizations that

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
are millions of
years ahead of us?

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Sure.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Because while in the
very early universe

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:10%
it would be unlikely to
get Earth-like planets,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:10%
there's no reason
why you couldn't

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.174 align:middle line:10%
have gotten a Earth-like planet,
say, five billion years ago, 5

00:06:24.174 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:10%
and 1/2 billion years ago,
six billion years ago,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:10%
which means those planets
are 1/2 a billion,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:10%
a billion, a billion and
1/2, two billion years older

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:10%
than the Earth.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they've had
a big head start.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So there could be all kinds of
life, including civilizations

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
much more advanced
than our own out there.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Assuming that they grow
at the same chronological pace

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have, it
could be amazing.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I look back, Robert,
at our technology

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
just over the last 100 years.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The growth has been
absolutely astounding.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Right
And this is why I

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.445 align:middle line:84%
think that the SETI
people, the people who

00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
are doing a search for
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
are having such a hard time.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they're looking
for radio signals.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Radio is the
technology of our time.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.744 align:middle line:84%
But we've only had serious
radio since about 1920.

00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's only been
around about 100 years.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Will it still be around
100 years from now,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
or will we have moved past it?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:10%
You know, in the 1800s,
the great German scientist

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:10%
and mathematician
Carl Gauss suggested

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:10%
we could look for
extraterrestrials by looking

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:10%
for the flames of
their gas lights.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.819 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So that was the most advanced
technology of their time.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But that was a
transitory technology.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't expect
to find gas lights

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
on an advanced
civilization today.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, a
civilization that's

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
100 years more advanced than
ours or 1,000 or a million

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
may well have gone
way past radio.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're kind of looking
for their gas lights.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK?

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And this could really
be the problem.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there's a
finite level of existence where

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:90%
they reach a plateau of life?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And then all of sudden, it
goes downhill and they're gone?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:90%
They're extinct?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well it
certainly happened--

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
could happen than any species
or civilization could have

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
an extinction event either
caused by natural causes--

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan used to say that
all species either become

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:90%
space faring or go extinct.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't become
space faring, if you don't

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
become capable of controlling
the flight of large objects

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in your solar system like
asteroids, sooner or later,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get blasted.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to get hit.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.873 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, right.

00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we have
a huge crater here

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the United States in Arizona
that's only 50,000 years old.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And there's much bigger craters.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Like the one near the Mars
Society space in the arctic

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is 20 kilometers in diameter.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
That was undoubtedly a
mass extinction event.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the dinosaurs
60 million years ago.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, of
course, civilizations

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
could destroy themselves
by wars, the atomic--

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Depletion of resources?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: I tend
to think not that.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
that civilizations

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
are capable always of
developing new resources.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, people used
to talk about, oh, we're

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
going to run out of oil.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.925 align:middle line:84%
And in 1972, the
Club of Rome put out

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
the report that limits
the growth-- basically

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
say we're going to run
out of everything by 1990.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, known oil reserves
today are much larger

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
than they were in 1972
despite all the oil

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that we've used since because
the technology's advanced.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So if a civilization is capable
of developing technology,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
it's capable of
keeping advancing

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's capable of
developing new resources.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.917 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, civilizations
could destroy themselves

00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
because, as they
become more advanced,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
their weaponry will
become more capable.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's possible.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Bad ideas can destroy
a civilization, OK?

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Bad ideas that lead
to self-destruction.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We see some of that
on Earth today.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
happening, yeah.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: But
nevertheless, I have

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to believe that it's
not a universal problem.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I have to believe that
some civilizations succeed,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that they get past
these problems

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and they continue
to grow and expand.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You said
Mars once had oceans.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.406 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
evidence of that--

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:90%
that it had an atmosphere.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the planet?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, as well
as we can understand,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
the situation is this.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You had oceans, you had rain.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It's raining down
through an atmosphere

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that's heavily carbon dioxide.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide can
dissolve, well, into water.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It goes down.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The carbonated water
hits the ground,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and then it becomes
carbonate minerals.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And it gets fixed there.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:90%
The carbons get stuck.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It starts thinning
out the carbon

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:90%
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this happens on Earth,
too, but we have plate tectonics

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that take the
geological material

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and rotate it through the
mantle and bake it out.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And the CO2 that gets fixed into
carbon, it gets released again.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Mars, on the other hand, is
too small for plate tectonics.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So the CO2 that got
fixed into carbonate

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
got stuck there forever.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the atmosphere
starts to thin out.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
As it thins out, the
planet becomes colder.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
When it becomes cold
enough, then you

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
can actually have another
phenomenon happen,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
which is absorption, which is
like the ground, the materials

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
sponging in CO2
from the atmosphere.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.225 align:middle line:84%
If they're cold, they
can sponge it in.

00:11:09.225 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Start sucking it in.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And then that thins it out,
gets colder and colder,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and finally gets so cold
that you can actually

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
have CO2 to start to freeze
out, which it does at the Mars

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
southern polar cap-- has
got frozen CO2 on it.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a big
reserve on Mars of CO2

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that is either just
absorbed or frozen.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And every year, Mars is in
a slightly elliptical orbit.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
During southern summer, it
becomes closer to the sun

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:90%
than it is in northern summer.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Martian
atmosphere actually

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.665 align:middle line:90%
thickens by 20% at that time--

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --from it
coming out of the ground.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
That's like the Earth's
atmospheric pressure

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:84%
going from 14
pounds to 17 pounds,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, as the season changes.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:90%
But it happens.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:90%
We've measured it.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, so if we wanted
to help this along,

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
if we had human
colonies on Mars that

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
could produce artificial
greenhouse gases--

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and we know how to produce
greenhouse gases that

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
are much more
effective than CO2.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We produce these
on purpose on Mars

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and release them in large
amounts in the atmosphere,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:90%
we could warm the planet.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
That would cause
the CO2 to outgas.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It would add a
lot to the effect.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.124 align:middle line:84%
And we could warm Mars enough
for liquid water again.

00:12:20.124 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's start the water cycle.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:84%
The streams of Mars
would flow again.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:90%
The rivers would flow.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The lakes and oceans
would start to fill up.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:90%
There'd be rain.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you could spread
plants on that planet.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
We could bring Mars to life.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
would that take?

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well,
part of this could

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:90%
be done amazingly quickly.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
That is, if we had substantial
human presence on Mars that

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:84%
could set up factories to
produce a floor of carbon gases

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
like CF4 and release
it at the same rate

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're currently producing
chlorofluorocarbons on Earth.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have to do
this throughout the planet?

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: No, no--

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just in
certain regions?

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: It doesn't matter.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Once you release it, it
would spread itself around.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.551 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going
to spread itself.

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:00.857 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
If we were to do
this at the same rate

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
we're currently
producing CFCs on Earth,

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.565 align:middle line:84%
which we produce
primarily for refrigerants

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and other such purposes-- but we
didn't put it in refrigerants.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We just release it to the
atmosphere, let it go, OK?

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Pollute on purpose.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Then in 50 years, we could warm
Mars up by about 10 centigrade.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.172 align:middle line:84%
And that would be enough to
force vast amounts of CO2

00:13:21.172 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
out of the soil
and out of the cap.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.754 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's tremendous.

00:13:23.754 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: That
would warm Mars up

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
over the next 50
years another 30,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.299 align:middle line:84%
40 C. With that kind of warming,
you would have liquid water.

00:13:34.299 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, you'd have
enough atmospheric pressure

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.995 align:middle line:90%
to support--

00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Because you
also have to have pressure

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:90%
to have liquid water.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And so in 100 years,
you'd have a Martian atmos--

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.571 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you have clouds?

00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You'd have clouds.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:90%
You'd have rain.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.126 align:middle line:90%
You'd have snow.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
When it rains,
there's some compounds

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Martian soil--
the peroxides--

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
that when they're
contacted by water,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
the compounds are destroyed,
releasing some oxygen.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that, the amount of
oxygen that they would release

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
would not be enough for
you and I to breathe.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But it would be enough
for plants to breathe.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Plants mostly need
carbon dioxide and water.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.109 align:middle line:84%
And they'd have plenty
of that on this Mars.

00:14:11.109 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
They need a certain
amount of warmth.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:10%
They need to be warm enough
for liquid water at least part

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:10%
of the year, OK?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.059 align:middle line:10%
And they need a little bit of
oxygen because they do respire.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
This would put enough for that.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So on this Mars, we could
start spreading plants.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're talking
about the kind of plants

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
we know about today,
which only about 1%

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
efficient in using solar
energy to do photosynthesis,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it would take about 1,000
years for those plants,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
if we spread them
around the planet,

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to produce enough oxygen for you
and I and other higher animals

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:90%
to breathe.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking
about 100 years from now,

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
it's really not
that big a stretch

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to think that we'll have genetic
engineering capabilities that

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
will be able to create plants
that are not 1% efficient but,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.632 align:middle line:84%
say, 3%, 5%, maybe
even 10% efficient.

00:14:56.632 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really speeds it up.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.381 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK?

00:14:58.381 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And that would speed it
up by that kind of factor.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that I believe that
as technology advances,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
including biotechnology,
we are going

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to become much more
capable of doing this.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I think Mars will be
terraformed not in 1,000 years,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
but in-- probably
within 200 years.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Mars warmed up,
what are the possibilities

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of vegetation which may
have been on the planet

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:90%
before to start sprouting again?

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, if there-- well,
certainly whatever life forms

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that are there now
will re-emerge.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.029 align:middle line:84%
See, I think Mars probably
did have life on its surface

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
during its warm and wet period.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason why
it shouldn't have.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe trees?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: No, I
don't think that.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I think given the time
that Mars was warm and wet,

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking more
microorganisms.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I could be wrong.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.406 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Algae, maybe?

00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Algae, yes.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.115 align:middle line:84%
It could have had algae
and perhaps simpler plants.

00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And if these things left
spores, they'd reemerge.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that was ever
alive on the surface,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%
in particular microbes I'm
thinking about here- when

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the surface got cold, they
would retreat underground

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
into the groundwater just as
the Earth's original inhabitants

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
See, the early Earth had no
oxygen in its atmosphere.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And the early Earth
life forms lived

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of environment.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact for them,
oxygen was toxic.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And when green plants
started producing oxygen,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
it made the surface of
the Earth uninhabitable

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
for most of its
original inhabitants.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And what happened is,
they retreated into the ground

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
water where they still are
three billion years later.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's original
inhabitants,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the anaerobic microorganisms,
are still alive underground.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The same thing what
happened with Mars.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
If there were life on
the Martian surface

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and had to retreat,
they'd retreat,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
but they'd still be
living there underground,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.325 align:middle line:84%
and this would be their
chance to come back.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "A Case for Mars."

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
You have wanted to
terraform Mars for years.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
Are you getting any
governmental support?

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:84%
Does-- are they jumping forward
saying, yeah, let's do this?

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, a couple things.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I view the
exploration, settlement,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:10%
and transformation of
Mars in a number of steps.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:10%
First, exploration, base
building, settlement

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:10%
and colonization, and
finally terraforming.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
period of time would be?

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I think we could
have our first human explorers

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.912 align:middle line:84%
on Mars within 10 years
if we decided to do it.

00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And then over the
next 20 years after that,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:84%
we could build
substantial bases on Mars.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.429 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're
talking 30 years out.

00:17:47.429 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I
think we could-- you know,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.722 align:middle line:84%
once we have large
greenhouses on Mars

00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and once we've set up
the farms, then you

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
bring in the colonists
in larger numbers.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
this century, there

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
could be a million people
living on Mars with--

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding me!

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, with substantial
industrial capabilities.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How exciting!

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And then the
terraforming process

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
could begin.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to have
substantial industrial

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
capabilities in place.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
be able to walk around

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
without masks on at some point?

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.657 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: At some point.

00:18:17.657 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking
about-- first of all,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
until we start
terraforming, no, OK?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Except inside, of course.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But once we start terraforming,
once we do this green-housing

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and it thickens the
atmosphere-- so we

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
thicken Martian
atmospheric pressure,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
say, from 1% Earth, which
is what it currently

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
is to 20% Earth-- once it's
about 20% Earth, which is three

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
PSI, then you could walk
around wearing an oxygen mask.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, you would be in the
situation of a high altitude

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:90%
pilot or an Everest climber.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So, people on that
Mars could walk around

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.329 align:middle line:84%
with an oxygen mask and
some good winter clothing.

00:18:56.329 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
eventually, Robert, they

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
want to take that
mask off, right?

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Now, that requires
oxygenating the atmosphere.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we've discussed, if we
talk about the kind of plants

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.302 align:middle line:84%
we have now, that's
a 1,000 year process.

00:19:09.302 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But if we talk about
more advanced plants

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.984 align:middle line:84%
that our descendants
will be able to engineer,

00:19:12.984 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be about
100 year process.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you would
point these, where?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.912 align:middle line:90%
All over the place?

00:19:16.912 --> 00:19:18.619 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Pretty much
all over the place.

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you plant
some that are best adapted

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
for the equator at
the equator and others

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:84%
in mid-latitudes and
other further north.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they be
seeds or actual plants?

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, in
general, you spread seeds

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and they grow into plants.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you throw
grass and everything else?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, yeah.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But you would want to do
your best to pre-adapt them.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But once they're out, they
will continue the adaptation

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what life does.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, that's right.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they will
re-seed themselves.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Absolutely, yes.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then insect
life starts and off you go?

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, insects.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in
terms of animal life,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.022 align:middle line:90%
lower animals first--

00:19:56.022 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
bring animals to Mars?

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Absolutely.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, and these animals that you
have on Mars, as well as people

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, will start to re-adapt.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.214 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for instance,
Mars will always

00:20:12.214 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:90%
be different from the Earth.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.682 align:middle line:84%
It will always have, for
instance, 38% Earth's gravity.

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:90%
We can change the atmosphere.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.879 align:middle line:90%
We can change the soil.

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:90%
We can have liquid water.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's still going
to be 1/3 gravity.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
animals and plants that

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
have been evolved to be
ideally adapted to this gravity

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
will start to re-adapt.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think we'll
probably see animals

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that are taller and
less stoutly constructed

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:84%
because they won't need to be
so stoutly constructed to deal

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:90%
with the gravity.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, humans will
evolve that way as well.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
This will take time.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, it
will take a lot of time

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
with creatures like humans
that have very long generation

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
spans.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
animals like mice,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
which have a generation
every 60 days,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.264 align:middle line:84%
will evolve much faster, and
insects even much, much faster.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How deep
would the oceans

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:90%
be that would start to liquefy?

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, fairly deep.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.262 align:middle line:10%
The topography on
Mars is extreme.

00:21:14.262 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have canyons
that are three times as

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:10%
deep as the Grand Canyon.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We have mountains three
times as tall as Everest.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the oceans on Mars
at their deepest-- well,

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.817 align:middle line:90%
about 12,000 feet.

00:21:29.817 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
there's a lot of water

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.197 align:middle line:84%
right now on Mars
underground or frozen?

00:21:34.197 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of water.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, I do.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you took away
the Earth's salt water oceans

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and just had the fresh water,
including the Great Lakes

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and places like that, there's
about as much water on Mars

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
as that Earth would have.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it salt water on Mars?

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I think
we'd see a lot of salt water

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:90%
because there are salts.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And once the water gets loose,
if there are salts around,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:90%
they'll dissolve in the water.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is exciting.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
When do we go?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, as
soon as either we

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
make a decision to go as
a public, as a government,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
or as private groups
can gain the capability

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:90%
to take the initiative.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of initiatives
underway right now that

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
have a chance of
getting us there.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
One is this proposal
that Dennis Tito has made

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
called Inspiration Mars,
which is to kick the thing off

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:84%
with a two-person Mars flyby
mission that was originally

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
proposed for 2018.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.470 align:middle line:84%
It's now been
rescheduled for 2021.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.417 align:middle line:84%
But 2021 is only
seven years away.

00:22:49.417 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It comes up fast.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And there's
significant pressure

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to get NASA to
embrace this plan.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
they have no plan.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Right now, NASA has no
plan to go anywhere.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.075 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely doable.

00:23:01.075 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The Inspiration Mars people
have their plan to do it.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
The Mars Society
just held a contest.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
We had 38 engineering
teams from universities

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
around the world enter to
present their own designs,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and we have a multitude
of credible designs

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:90%
for pulling this off.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll certainly by
2021 have the hardware

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of both the NASA
SLS, the heavy launch system,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and the Spacex Falcon
Heavy-- heavy launch system--

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:90%
will both be ready.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll have Dragons.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:90%
We'll have Orions.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.679 align:middle line:90%
These are capsules.

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Probably can have half modules.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
This mission's doable.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long's the trip?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, that mission,
it's a fly-by mission.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And it would take about 600
days to fly to Mars and back.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, almost two years.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.547 align:middle line:84%
Now, an actual
human Mars mission

00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
that goes to the
surface, though, only

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:90%
takes six months to get there.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you time it right.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.036 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: That's
right, which you would.

00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And-- takes six months
there, then you're

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
there a year and a half on the
surface, and then six months

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.290 align:middle line:90%
coming back.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a more expensive
proposition than a flyby.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The-- once again, it's a
question of deciding to do it.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing I like about
the Inspiration Mars mission

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
is it would take
away the excuses.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It would take away
the excuse, oh, we

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
can't go because the
radiation is too much.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
That mission would actually
take a bigger radiation dose

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
than you would going
to Mars landing

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.367 align:middle line:84%
and then coming back the
way we really want to do it.

00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, and--
because right now,

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
NASA is using radiation the way
a 10-year-old uses a snowfall.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a snow day.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's snowing!

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't have to go to school.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
trumpeting radiation

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
as a reason why they
can't go to Mars

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.774 align:middle line:84%
until some new ultra-fast
propulsion system is developed

00:24:46.774 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
which isn't going
to be developed.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And so they don't have to go.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Snow day!

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, it's incredible.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the crews
that NASA is going

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to send to the space
station over the next 10

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
years cumulatively, because
they stay on orbit all the time,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and the dose rate is about half
that of interplanetary space

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
at the space station,
they will collectively

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
take the same amount
of radiation dose

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
as we would sending
five crews to Mars

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and back over the
same period of time.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:90%
So the excuse is phony.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.001 align:middle line:84%
And the Inspiration Mars
mission would show that.

00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It would cut this thing loose.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It would break us free
of this fear factor

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and say, let's get on with it.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going to
have a $17 billion a year

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
space program, it
ought to embrace

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
goals that are worthy of
those costs and risks.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And that means going to
Mars, exploring, opening up--

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
this is exciting.

00:25:37.016 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: New world.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me ask you the
really supernatural question,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:90%
the paranormal question.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we
are the Martians?

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And we came here from Mars
if not in physical form,

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
at least in organisms blown
off by a little meteorite

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: It's entirely
possible that we

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
are descended from
martian organisms.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Because Mars had oceans, and
it had been before the Earth

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:90%
had oceans.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Mars is smaller.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It cooled off to be cool
enough for liquid water

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
before the Earth did.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
at a time when there

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of asteroids
and large meteors flying

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
around the solar system,
bombarding the planet.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the early solar
system was much more active

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
a free fire zone
then it is today.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is Mars
as old as we are?

00:26:27.145 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: It's older.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is much--
I mean, by much?

00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, it's
only a little older.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But the planet cooled--
the early Earth was--

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
million years older?

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.635 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Oh, it's more
than a million years older.

00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:42.370 align:middle line:90%
But the early Earth was molten.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.157 align:middle line:90%
It was too hot for liquid water.

00:26:44.157 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: So was Mars.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But being smaller, it has more
surface compared to its volume

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and also is further
from the sun.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.242 align:middle line:90%
So it--

00:26:52.242 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cooled faster.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Cooled faster.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So Mars had liquid water before
the Earth had liquid water.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And so Mars had a chance to
develop life before Earth did.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And now here you
have Mars and Earth

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.914 align:middle line:84%
both being bombarded by little
and big asteroids and meteors

00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff going on.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Comets, Everything.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.596 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: You name it.

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so material is being
scattered back and forth

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and Mars.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
If Mars had life first, is every
possibility that some of that

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:90%
was chipped off and landed here.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And the-- and
furthermore, there's

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
even some evidence to support
this other than the fact

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that it's possible.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is that
we find no free living

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
organisms on Earth that
are simpler than bacteria.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's strange.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Because as simple
as bacteria are,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
they're really very
complicated things.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of bacteria
being the first life

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is like imagining the Concord
being the first machine.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, before there were Concords,
there were other airplanes.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Before there were airplanes,
there were steamboats,

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and before they were steamboats,
there were sailing ships.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.829 align:middle line:84%
And you go all the
way back in time.

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
history of technology

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:90%
before you get to the Concord.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, there had to be a whole
history of prior development

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
before we get to the kind
of well-organized bacteria

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:90%
that we see on Earth today.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%
So what does that suggest?

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that bacteria
could be immigrants--

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that, in other words,
that we didn't start

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning
here on Earth.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
We started with
the first organisms

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that were well-developed
enough to survive space flight.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is exciting.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.279 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: We can find
that out by going to Mars.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go to Mars
and find not only microbes,

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that kind that we know, but
simpler ones representing

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:84%
a prior evolution,
that would, in fact,

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
show that life on
Earth came from Mars.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we getting much
support from NASA to go?

00:28:48.942 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, certainly
in the ranks of NASA,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.608 align:middle line:84%
there's plenty of
people that want to go.

00:28:52.608 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
People join NASA because this
is what they want to do, OK?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.035 align:middle line:90%
This is why astronauts join.

00:28:58.035 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:90%
This is why engineers join.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.951 align:middle line:84%
This is why people want
to be part of NASA.

00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But the leadership
of NASA at the top

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
are political appointees
who just play the game and--

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do what they're told.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.679 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, they
do what they're told,

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
or they're quite comfortable
running a space agency

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.889 align:middle line:84%
without clear goals because
that puts less pressure on them.

00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:10%
If you're not-- in other words,
Kennedy put pressure on NASA.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.805 align:middle line:10%
He said, I want you on the
moon by the end of the decade.

00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:23.721 align:middle line:10%
They would have been
much happier-- certainly,

00:29:23.721 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:10%
the people in charge would have
been much happier saying, look,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:10%
you want us on the moon?

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Wouldn't it be great
if we just-- you

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.664 align:middle line:10%
let us tell you
when we're ready?

00:29:31.664 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd still
be worried about it.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Robert, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.246 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: My pleasure.

00:29:37.246 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's called
"The Case for Mars."

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:10%
In an upcoming episode
of "Beyond Belief,"

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be talking
about real human beings who

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:10%
are training to go to Mars.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:84%
That'll be next on
"Beyond Belief."

00:29:52.310 --> 00:30:09.267 align:middle line:90%
