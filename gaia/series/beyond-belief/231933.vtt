00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
Amy Robeson with us, an Akashic
record master and healer.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:10%
She empowers individuals
through connecting them

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
to the Akashic Records, DNA
activations, light codes,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:10%
and light language, guiding
them to unlock their highest

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:10%
potential and walk
their divine path.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Amy.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.305 align:middle line:84%
>>AMY ROBESON: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to
be here with you.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.437 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
all start for you?

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.847 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: For me, I
started off pretty young,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:84%
knowing different things that I
probably shouldn't have known.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:90%
I just knew things as a kid.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:10%
And I started becoming
really empathic as a kid

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:10%
when I would tune in to
the adults' energy, when

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.896 align:middle line:10%
they were unpredictable.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were
you when this started?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.355 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: My very first
memory was when I was one--

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:08.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One years old?

00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:09.113 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Mm-hmm.

00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:84%
My mom was dating a guy,
and I was in my room.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't hear
their conversation,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but I knew when he came in that
would be the last time I would

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
see him, and he said goodbye.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And I remember what
was hanging on my crib.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.775 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in my crib
and I remember saying goodbye.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean goodbye?

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They broke
up and so I knew

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.675 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't see him again.

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought maybe
he passed on or something

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: No.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
They broke up, and I loved him.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, he was around my
sister and I and my mom,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.698 align:middle line:84%
and I just knew that that
was the last time I was

00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:48.865 align:middle line:90%
going to ever see him again.

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At age two, you had
a prophetic dream about what?

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Something
really silly.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So I had a dream about a lemon
knickknack and how it broke.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this dream
was at two years old.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We lived at one
side of the street,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.118 align:middle line:84%
and when we were
four years old, we

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
moved to the other
side of the street.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And when my mom came
home and I woke up,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
there was a lemon knickknack
on the coffee table,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and it broke exactly how
I saw it in my dream.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who taught you these
things at that young age?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Where did you learn this stuff?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: No one
taught me, per se.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I just tuned into the
energy of whatever

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
was going on because I
had unpredictable parents.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
My stepdad was a
severe alcoholic,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:90%
but my grandma had gifts.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
So my grandma was--

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
she did tarot card readings
and astrology readings.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel my gifts
came from the lineage

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:90%
of my mom's side of the family.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you picked it
up from your grandmother.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:90%
But my mom has gifts, too.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not as extensive
as yours, right?

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: If you
train yourself,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
you can have more
extensive gifts.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what you're
wanting to do with those gifts.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, we hear a lot
about the Akashic Records.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.515 align:middle line:90%
Actually, what are they?

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They are a field
of infinite possibilities.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Every word, deed,
thought from the moment

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
your soul is incepted is
recorded in the Akashic field,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and we can open them up to
receive love and guidance

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and support in any and
all areas of our life.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
So it's a cosmic field.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything we do in
our life is in those Records?

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Past, present, and
future, everything.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we sneak up
there and erase anything?

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: You can't erase.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:90%
You can transform.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If you've already
experienced something,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
you can transform what
you've experienced.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But you can't erase
that experience

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
because it made you who you are.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
It shaped your soul.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you did
something lousy in your life

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the Records,
so you can't go back there

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:90%
and make amends?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: You can do a
past-life regression depression

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and heal that fragment of your
soul by calling it back to you.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
So yes, you can make amends.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.295 align:middle line:84%
You just can't
erase what happened.

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 2008,
you had nightmares

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that led you to study the
Akashic Records and mediumship.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.486 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about those nightmares.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: So I kept having
dreams that I was being killed

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
and these dreams were horrific.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And where I was, I
was in the hell realms

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because I was experiencing
different entities

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and different beings that were
either hurting me or hurting

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
someone else.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to understand
my dreams so that they

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't torture me anymore.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I found a teacher
to help me understand them

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.256 align:middle line:84%
and to interpret
dreams themselves.

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was
trying to kill you?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Just
different beings.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't-- it was more
of my subconscious being

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
in the place that I shouldn't
have been because I could bring

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness to different
realms that I was trying to find

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
answers in, because my stepdad
was a severe alcoholic and he

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
passed away and I
didn't have closure,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.767 align:middle line:84%
and so I was trying
to find closure.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound like
you had a rough childhood.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.015 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: I did.

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:09.815 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you picked
yourself up, look at you now?

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, I did.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can either be
victims of our circumstance

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:90%
or we can be empowered by them.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And so I chose to be empowered.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 10 years
ago, you started

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:90%
teaching the Akashic Records.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you teach them?

00:05:26.822 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I teach people
how to access their Akashic

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Records through a prayer and
using crystalline energy.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
quick prayer we can

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
get in within 30
seconds or longer,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
grounded you are.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we call crystalline
energy to act as keys

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:90%
to open the Records themselves.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do the prayer for us.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I usually
do the prayer silently

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
because every prayer
is intentionally

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.958 align:middle line:90%
done within the heart space.

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
it start though?

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I, and
then I state my name.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
you just go into it?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everybody's
prayer is different?

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: It can be customized.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So we have standard prayers
inside of my program

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
called sacred awakening where
I teach the Akashic Records.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get advanced,
you can customize the prayer.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But everyone-- I give
several different options

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
because different words resonate
more with different people.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Later in
the program, you're

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:90%
going to do my Akashic Records.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Will there be things in
there that would shock me?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: I'm not sure.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It'll depend on what they share.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I hope, or maybe not.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you have past lives.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.515 align:middle line:90%
Are they in the Records, too?

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Past lives are in the
Records, your present life

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.385 align:middle line:84%
and future
possibilities as well.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you're constantly
learning new things every time

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
you teach the Records.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.138 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:06:46.138 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
my favorite things,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because the Records
aren't static.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They're evolving just as
we're evolving as well.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn and we change
and our consciousness rises,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.085 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of the
Records rises as well.

00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:03.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our producers were
telling me before the show

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.272 align:middle line:84%
that you have a beautiful
little daughter.

00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: I do.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: She's
four and a half.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something mystical
about her, wasn't there?

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: She is
absolutely amazing.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And yes, she's a
little mystical being.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before
she was born, she

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.745 align:middle line:90%
came to visit you in meditation?

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: She would visit
me and she would tell me

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that she was going
to be my daughter

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
and that she was going to come.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted her to come
sooner than what she came,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
and I even told my husband--

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.732 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, we need to
have a baby sooner.

00:07:35.732 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't married at the
time, but I was ready for her

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But she was taking
her dear, sweet time

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because she wanted to come
in when the timing was right.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did
she time it right?

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Oh, she did.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.495 align:middle line:90%
She timed it during COVID.

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:51.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a pain under
what we call the baby moon.

00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:52.775 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened.

00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:53.575 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So my husband and I, we were
traveling to go on our babymoon,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and I had an ultrasound
a few days before that,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
which was my 20-week ultrasound.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And the pain was getting so
severe while we were driving.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And overnight, I
was very concerned.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when I woke
up in the morning,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go to the hospital
to just see what was going on.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: And I ended up having
emergency surgery at 20 weeks

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
my ovary was twisted.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into surgery
and while I was under,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I went into a review inside
of the Akashic Records

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.308 align:middle line:84%
where they showed me
I died at childbirth.

00:08:35.308 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In another life?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.696 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: No, in this lifetime.

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So they showed me that I died
at childbirth in this lifetime

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:90%
from bleeding out.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when I woke
up from surgery,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't remember it right away.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't remember
it until I started

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
having a ton of past
lives show up while I was

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:90%
outside of the Akashic Records.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I would be taking
a shower, and I

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
would have a ton of
past lives, show me

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
where I died or the baby
died or we both died.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had many, many lifetimes
where I died during childbirth

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.016 align:middle line:90%
in my previous lifetimes.

00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank God it
didn't happen this time.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Oh my God,
I'm so grateful it

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.515 align:middle line:90%
didn't happen this time.

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think it was
knowledge of the past that

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
helped prevent it this time?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
One, I had a soul contract
with myself to clear this,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and my daughter was a
part of that soul contract

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
as well, that she was
going to help me clear it.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she was waiting
to come in, because my husband

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and I were trying for a very
long time to get pregnant.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And so she waited until
it was the right time.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
all about advocacy.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
So I had this information.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept advocating
for another ultrasound

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I was
going to bleed out if I went

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:90%
into labor, and I gave birth.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How
concerned were doctors

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.835 align:middle line:90%
that you might die this time?

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: My doctor
was very kind,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
but she wanted to follow the
rules of health insurance

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
they have to do.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: And so I kept telling
her and telling her and telling

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.215 align:middle line:90%
her, and she was like--

00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want one
another ultrasound.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to test.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she wanted
to know, know, right?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: And she would--

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
where I lived at the
time, they didn't

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:90%
have the advanced equipment.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you would have to go
over the hill to a different

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
hospital, which was
a 45-minute drive.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.913 align:middle line:84%
And so she used the
equipment that was there.

00:10:35.913 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I'm
not seeing anything.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And finally she was
like, OK, you can go.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I just have to write it
up a certain way in order

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
for it to be covered
by insurance.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
went, the doctor--

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the ultrasound tech was like,
I have to be right back.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
I have to go talk to the doctor.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
back in and he's

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
like, I need you to
come back after lunch.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:90%
The doctor needs to talk to you.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew
something was wrong.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
your near-death experience

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
saved your life and
your daughter's life?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because if I
didn't have that experience,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to have gone
through an emergency surgery

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
at 20 weeks, my body
made me aware that there

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
was something wrong.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And advocacy is really
important because when

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
you feel something is
wrong, your intuition

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
is telling you
something, your guides

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
are telling you something.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
You got to advocate
for yourself.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, your daughter
is only four years old,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:84%
but what did she experience
through all of this?

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: So when
I was pregnant,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I would get that she
wanted to come early,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and so I would
have to talk to her

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and tell her that she
couldn't come as soon as she

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come, because she
wanted to experience humanness.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She wanted out.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, she wanted out.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd have to show
her that if you come early,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
your kidneys aren't developed,
your lungs aren't developed.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have shared
with her that she

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come sooner
than she was supposed to.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, mommy, I would go,
let me out, let me out, let me

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
out, and you would say,
no, you have to stay in.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not time yet.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so to some degree,
I feel like she

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
understands what was going on.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet she does.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's really cute whenever
we talk about pregnancy

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:34.425 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how she shares it
as a toddler or a four-year-old

00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:35.225 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She'll carry that
for the rest of her life,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
you know that?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.655 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That was a part of her
birth plan and birth story

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
into this world.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It had a profound
effect on your life, didn't it?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: It did.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, it did.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I started experiencing and
understanding past lives

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
on a next level and soul
contracts on the next level

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the holders
of the Akashic Records?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
The Guardians?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So the Guardians, also known
as masters, teachers and loved

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
ones, could be ascended masters
like Buddha, Jesus, Mother Mary.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Could also be goddesses
like Isis, Kuan Yin.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be other beings like
galactic beings like Arcturians

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
or Pleiadians or
angels, guardian angels

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones and ancestors
that you've never met or are not

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
even aware because
of pop culture.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, what does
a soul contract mean?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: A soul contract is a
contract your soul agrees upon

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
before coming in this lifetime,
and we have many contracts

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
with different beings to
act out certain things

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:90%
within those contracts.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so a contract can be
to assist you in growing.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
A contract can be to
clear lifetimes of trauma.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
A contract can be to show you
love, to show you kindness,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
or to show you cruelty so
that you empower yourself

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:90%
to make different decisions.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what
contracts you decided

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.418 align:middle line:90%
to make before you came here.

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do we sign
that contract with?

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: We sign
it with our self

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.645 align:middle line:84%
and other beings that agreed to
play certain roles in your life.

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:23.973 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you change it
at all during your lifetime?

00:14:23.973 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You have free will and so
you can change the contracts

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:90%
you've made with yourself.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Certain contracts you don't want
to change because they are to

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:90%
empower you.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And certain contracts
become outdated

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.115 align:middle line:84%
and we want to clear those
if they become outdated.

00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you had your
near-death experiences,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
how did you reshape
your own on tracks

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
based on what happened to you?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
contracts that I had

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
with myself and
with my daughter was

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to clear the lifetimes of
trauma that I experienced

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
from dying at childbirth
in previous lifetimes,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
or the child dying
at childbirth,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
or both of us dying
at childbirth.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So the contract was to complete
that and to heal that trauma.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when I would go into
these past life regressions,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I would reclaim the
fragment of my soul

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that were stuck in
those lifetimes.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Knowing
what your past lives

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
were like in these
near-death experiences

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that you had, did it
scare you in this life?

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: No, because
I knew no matter what,

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
my daughter was
going to be OK, and I

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
had to be the biggest
advocate for myself,

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't going
to stop until someone

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.585 align:middle line:84%
gave me answers and/or brought
me to peace that it wasn't going

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:45.385 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:15:45.385 --> 00:15:47.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of past lives?

00:15:47.095 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Past lives, I think
are incredibly empowering.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:90%
They are not to be glamorized.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
You'll often hear people say,
I was a king, I was a queen,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I was this, that or whatever.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And the question is always going
to be, how does that information

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:90%
serve you?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when a past life
is presented to you,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it is there to assist you
in either reclaiming a gift

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.975 align:middle line:84%
or to reclaim a fragment of your
soul that is frozen in time.

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they help
heal your current life?

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely, yeah.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.625 align:middle line:90%
If, let's say you--

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drowned in a past life.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you afraid of
water in your current life?

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I drowned
in a past life.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I drowned many times
in previous lifetimes.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
one of the things

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I had to clear in
this lifetime as well.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, you
can have that fear.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a certain
fear of something,

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it could be a past life
that's influencing that fear.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have
patterns as well

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that could be influenced by
previous lifetimes as well.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about a client you

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
who had some things going
on in their past lives

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
and what they did.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Someone shared with me
that a psychic told him

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that he got his
hands cut off, and he

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
was confused by what to
do with this information,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because she said that
he got his hands cut off

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
in a previous
lifetime because he

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:84%
was an executor
that would cut off

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:90%
people's hands as punishment.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
And so he had a lot
of different problems

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
with his own hands
in this lifetime.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So that information,
while it might

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
have been important at
that moment in time,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
unless you have the
ability to clear it,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that just leaves
someone confused on what

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%
to do with that information.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
talking to him, I go,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
it's really important that
you nourish your hands

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and that you reclaim this
fragment of your soul

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
frozen in that lifetime.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And until you claim
it, you're just

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
going to continue to have
problems with your hands.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that the
Guardians were sharing with them

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
was that it's important to
put butter on his hands.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Butter?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Butter.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.555 align:middle line:84%
And he started laughing because
that was something his mother

00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:07.355 align:middle line:90%
used to do.

00:18:07.355 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many past
lives do you think we have?

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: It just depends
on how old your soul is.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Some souls are newer and
some souls are ancient

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and some are medium.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Medium length.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Time is not as it seems here.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So we live on linear time,
but our souls are eternal

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and we can have
many, many lifetimes.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.777 align:middle line:84%
And then some choose only to
do a few lifetimes because they

00:18:36.777 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
want to learn certain
things, and they

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:90%
want to stay in the ethers.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we keep coming
back and their reincarnation

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
to get better and
better and better

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.446 align:middle line:84%
until we reach that
level of perfection?

00:18:48.446 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: We have
the opportunity.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So every time we transition
and we go into the cosmos,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:90%
we go into a review.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And that review lets us know
how we've impacted people,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:84%
how we've made people feel, how
we've negatively impacted them,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
how we positively
impacted them, and did we

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
fulfill our soul
contracts, and what

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:90%
contracts did we not fulfill.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us
from that perspective

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to decide how we want to
grow from those experiences.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when we come
back into this lifetime,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to
heal those experiences so we

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:90%
can reach a higher ascension.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might there be past
lives we're not too proud of?

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:34.322 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Most of
us are not angels.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Some have been angels
in previous lifetimes,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:84%
our previous experiences,
I should say.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of us have had
challenges and experiences that

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:84%
have caused us trauma or
caused harm to others,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to
undo those experiences

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
in a way of making them
right by bringing our light,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
bringing our message,
and impacting

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%
the world in servitude.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
progression of our past lives

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
get better and better and
better, or do we take a drop,

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and then come back up again
and take another drop?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Or does it constantly
get better and better?

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: It
depends on the soul.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
come into this body,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
we forget everything
that we learned

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:90%
while we were in transition.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have hard lifetimes.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give an example.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
My stepdad and I,
we had an agreement

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that he would be tough on me so
I could grow into the person I'm

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
meant to be, and
he didn't do what

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
he was supposed to do in
this lifetime in terms

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
of healing his trauma and
fulfilling most of his contracts

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
because he numbed
out with alcohol.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And some people choose other
devices or other substances,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and it could be TV,
it could be food,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
it could be any
sort of addiction

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying
to escape their pain.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And until they
decide to get help

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
for that, and in all
the different ways

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
help, sometimes they

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:84%
don't fulfill what
they're meant to do.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So they have to go back to
school when they transition

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.042 align:middle line:84%
and get the help they need
from different beings.

00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
important for us

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to access our Akashic Records?

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: The Records
have the ability

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to offer multiple perspectives
on any given situation.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we get tunnel
vision where we only

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
see one perspective, and
that's not how life is.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:90%
There's many things to consider.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the person that maybe
told you off or made you mad,

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're having
something terribly

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
go wrong in their family, and
they're dealing with an illness

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:90%
that you have no idea about.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you're meant to show
them kindness and not overreact.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And so perspective
is everything.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we are able to have
a 360-degree perspective,

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
it allows us to find
peace in the situation.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the
situation was right or wrong,

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:90%
it's to find peace.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.336 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:22:21.336 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do our past lives
contribute to our future life?

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
us better people?

00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So we make decisions before we
come here on who we want to be,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
what paths we want
to take, who we

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
want to interact with as
well, and you set yourself up

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
for success before you
come into this lifetime.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And because you
have free will, it

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
will all shake out the way
it's supposed to shake out

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
based on your
decisions and reactions

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.526 align:middle line:84%
and experiences to
those reactions.

00:22:57.526 --> 00:23:01.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we had past lives
on other planetary systems?

00:23:01.065 --> 00:23:01.865 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:03.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have?

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, most souls have.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're into
the Akashic Records, too?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Everything is
in the Akashic Records.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything about Mother Earth
is in the Akashic Records.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything about
galactic planets

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:90%
are in the Akashic Records.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, every past life,
everything about animals,

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
everything about rocks,
everything about buildings,

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.576 align:middle line:84%
houses, any object, place or
thing, has an Akashic Records.

00:23:26.576 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
great discussions

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.155 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:23:30.155 --> 00:23:30.955 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:23:30.955 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it like?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.235 align:middle line:90%
Did you have a past life there?

00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yes, I had many
past lives in Lemuria.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Lemurians
were very telepathic.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They were very heart-centered
and very crystalline beings.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They worked with a
lot of the crystals.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had read that
they had mermaids there.

00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: They did.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans and Lemurians
had mermaids as well.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the opportunity
to take different clients

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
into past life regressions where
a mermaid lifetime was revealed.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd they go?

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Where did they go?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they?

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.006 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: We still
have mermaids.

00:24:16.006 --> 00:24:17.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where?

00:24:17.042 --> 00:24:18.365 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: In the ocean.

00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Show me.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: [LAUGHS] They're
different dimensional beings

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
that can show up as well.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Similar to galactic beings
that travel in and out

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.715 align:middle line:84%
of different
dimensional portals.

00:24:33.715 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else did the
mermaids try to convey to us?

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They worked with some of
your clients, didn't they?

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So one of my clients,
when I took her

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
on a past life regression,
hair was really important

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:90%
as a Lemurian mermaid.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hair?

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Hair.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, our hair.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The hair, the way
that I saw it when

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
we were in the past
life and the way

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:84%
she was also conveying
it was, the hair glows.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.695 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like Rapunzel in Disney.

00:25:02.695 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: And--

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Down your golden hair.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it glows and it
has healing powers.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And it acts like antennas to
share information and light

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:90%
codes.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
mermaids helpful to people?

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:90%
They lived in communities.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so for that particular
lifetime that was revealed--

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
this lifetime she was showing my
client all of the gifts she had.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So not every past
life is traumatic,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
but she was trying to show her
the power and the gifts she had

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.906 align:middle line:84%
and what she could do with
her hair in this lifetime.

00:25:41.906 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we have been
animals in another life?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I've had many different clients
be many different animals

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:90%
in different lifetimes.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I've had a client that
told me she was a fly.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
A client told me that
she was a dragonfly.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Insects are also
part of animals when

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about past lives.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
A bear.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.756 align:middle line:90%
A polar bear.

00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they originate from
other planetary systems, too?

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: They do.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So the animals that come
into our Earth's experience,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
they have made agreements
to be of service to us.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And they bring certain
animal medicines to us.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a soul family?

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: A soul
family is a group

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.606 align:middle line:84%
of souls that travel together
into different lifetimes.

00:26:31.606 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They stay together?

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Some will
be in the cosmos

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and some will be in this
timeline that we're on.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Just depends on where
they're at in their evolution

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and how they want to
assist on what side.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.805 align:middle line:84%
Do they want to assist
on the Earth side,

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
or do they want to assist
on the cosmos side?

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the people you're
friendly with in this life,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
might you have had relationships
with them in previous lives?

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.132 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:26:56.132 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And the people that get on
your nerves are your enemies

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
or you don't get along
with, they can also

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:90%
be a part of your soul family.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can other people, not
someone like you who's gifted--

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
but can somebody--
can my neighbor

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.005 align:middle line:90%
access my Akashic Records?

00:27:13.005 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: No.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
No one can access your
Records without permission.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Guardians will
not grant permission.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
If someone's accessing your
Records without permission

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting
information, they're

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:84%
accessing the false
Akashic Records.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you wanted
to know about somebody,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
you can't go to the Akashic
Records and peer into it.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: No.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:40.165 align:middle line:84%
It's against free will, and
it breaks spiritual laws.

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:42.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
beings do you encounter?

00:27:42.615 --> 00:27:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I experience
all sorts of beings

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
from galactic beings, light
beings, angels, animal spirit

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:90%
guides, all sorts of beings.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do ETs come to you?

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I call them galactic
light beings.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
And they do come to me.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And it will depend on
what I'm working on

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
or who I'm working with,
and when they show up.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What star
systems do they come from?

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: It just depends
on the client or myself.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.083 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot of
Arcturians that show up.

00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
Pleiadians that show up.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.562 align:middle line:84%
I have some beings that
I know they're of light,

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know their names.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on
who I'm working with.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They want
to be of service.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's beings like
entities or dark forces

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that are attached to the person
were the light beings will come

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
in, the galactic
beings will come in

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
to help clear them out and
escort them back to where

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all
different from Pleiadians

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.738 align:middle line:90%
to the Arcturians?

00:28:42.738 --> 00:28:43.905 align:middle line:90%
Do they do different things?

00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, they do.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians are more
emotional, healing, support

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and feminine energy,
where the Arcturians help

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of sacred geometry
and galactic codes and DNA

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:90%
repair.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're more
scientists, aren't they?

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.655 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, yes.

00:29:01.655 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can you
use your past lives

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:90%
to enhance your current life?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: To utilize
the information in a way

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to better understand yourself.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I'm having a hard
time with people pleasing,

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and I have a past life that
shows up where I was always

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
taking care of everyone else,
and I never said no to anything.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, that past
life is showing me

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
fragment of my soul

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that stuck in time that's
continuing this pattern

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.183 align:middle line:90%
and behavior.

00:29:35.183 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to reclaim
that fragment of my soul

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to help me with my people
pleasing in this lifetime,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and to clear it.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain what
soul fragments are.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Soul fragments are
when your soul fractals out

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
into tiny little particles.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And those tiny particles
have memories and experiences

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that will continue to live
that particular experience.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Good example of this
would be is if you've ever

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:84%
had a conversation with
someone, and days later, you're

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:84%
still thinking about
that conversation, that

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
is showing you that there's
a fragment of your soul

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that's still stuck
in that conversation

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.225 align:middle line:90%
that you fractile outward.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the soul that
occupies me now a soul

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that I had in a previous
life, in a previous life,

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.905 align:middle line:90%
in a previous life?

00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:27.747 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, your
soul is your pure essence.

00:30:27.747 --> 00:30:28.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That doesn't change?

00:30:28.955 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: No, it doesn't.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It's your essence.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are as a whole.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.180 align:middle line:90%
You are not broken.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Your soul isn't broken.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Your essence isn't broken.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:90%
You're whole.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The soul beings that
are out there to assist you,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:90%
do they come to you often?

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, I talk to
different beings every day

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:90%
in the Akashic Records.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Just depends
on the day, but a lot.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And they usually
speak as a collective

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
overwhelming if I saw them all.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So I just allow them to
speak to me as a collective.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And if it's important for
me to know exactly one

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:84%
particular being or
several particular beings,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:90%
they'll show me.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
want out of this?

00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They want to
support humanity and evolving,

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.555 align:middle line:84%
and they want to support whoever
they're working with to evolve.

00:31:17.555 --> 00:31:19.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
etheric implants?

00:31:19.826 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Etheric implants
are energetic implants

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
within the energy bodies or
subtle bodies, the etheric body.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're placed there by
dark forces or entities that

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
want to cause some sort of
harm, or to receive something

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.825 align:middle line:84%
from that person, or to prevent
them from doing something.

00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:44.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can an individual
get rid of it on their own?

00:31:44.255 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: They can.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely they can.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Or they can get support.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Depends on what their
level of skill is

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:90%
and their understanding.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's intuitive.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how to
tune into your body

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and understand what's
going on, you can do it,

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.360 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes people
need assistance

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.075 align:middle line:90%
in order to clear those things.

00:32:05.075 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, what
creates a bad person?

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Forgetting who they
are and who they're meant to be.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say that
slightly different.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't think anyone's bad.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they
numb out and they are not

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
participating in life the way
that their soul wants them to.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not
making decisions

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
based on what they were
meant to do in this lifetime,

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and so they get lost.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You can make bad decisions
in a lifetime, and then

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.185 align:middle line:84%
the next lifetime you can make
better decisions where you heal.

00:32:41.185 --> 00:32:43.676 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
parasitic entity?

00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: A parasitic entity is
like a parasite within the gut,

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or within the energy bodies that
is eating off the life force.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we contract that?

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.280 align:middle line:90%
How do we get that?

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.215 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: So sometimes it's
through the foods we eat.

00:33:01.215 --> 00:33:02.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:02.015 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes there
are bad gut bugs,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think about it as
either good gut bugs or bad gut

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:90%
bugs.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we can also have an
energetic parasite as well.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through our
actions and deeds?

00:33:16.825 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: No, through
outside influences.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So there could be a dark
force or entity that

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:84%
wants to feed off your
energy or influencing

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
you to behave in a
certain way, so there

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:84%
can be entities that are
influencing that person

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.725 align:middle line:84%
to behave and to act
in a very evil way.

00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
parasitic entities,

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.285 align:middle line:84%
can they influence
my personality today?

00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:41.512 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:33:41.512 --> 00:33:43.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they do that?

00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They
influence your mood.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:90%
They influence your thoughts.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
They influence your
behaviors by making you feel

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:90%
or to act in a certain way.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if someone's
pressing on your hand

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
really gently,
eventually you're going

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to move your hand because
it's going to annoy you.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's
something energetically,

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
like an energetic parasite or
if it's an etheric implant,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
it's going to influence your
behavior because it's pressing

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:90%
on you to behave that way.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
higher beings that

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are out there, what are
they trying to convey to us?

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.720 align:middle line:90%
To you?

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yeah,
they're trying to let

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
us know that we're here
to remember who we are

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and what we're here to
do, and that we're here

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.882 align:middle line:84%
to raise the consciousness of
this planet so we can evolve.

00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:40.142 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you closer to
what entities personally?

00:34:40.142 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Well,
first off, I enjoy

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
working with the masters,
teachers and the loved ones

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
So whoever wants
to come forward,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I love working with them.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the galactic
beings that I

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.819 align:middle line:84%
enjoy working with the
most are the Arcturians.

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:52.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is that?

00:34:52.985 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I have had many,
many, many, many lifetimes

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.825 align:middle line:90%
as an Arcturian.

00:34:57.825 --> 00:34:59.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were an Arcturian?

00:34:59.165 --> 00:34:59.965 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:01.206 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know them?

00:35:01.206 --> 00:35:02.035 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:35:02.035 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
heartwarming people?

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.365 align:middle line:90%
You seem to be one.

00:35:05.365 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They are very
heart-centered and very

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
matter-of-fact in
the ways that they

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.300 align:middle line:84%
want to work with
energy and the DNA.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your channeling life.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I channel
through the Akashic Records,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and I also channel with
light language as well.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I allow myself to
just receive and to share.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you always get into
somebody's Records when you try?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I've never
not been able to get

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:90%
in someone's Records.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:35:45.037 --> 00:35:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: The only time that
I've had something weird come up

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:84%
is when someone had too much
alcohol over the weekend,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and they told me that
we needed to reschedule

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
because the alcohol was
still influencing her system,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and so she would receive a
better reading the next day.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So we just rescheduled
for the next day.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would alcohol
affect her and not you?

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Alcohol can
rip holes in our aura

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and they can also influence
our mood and our behavior

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
we're drinking,

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:90%
how we're consuming it as well.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so any sort of
substance can influence

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.850 align:middle line:90%
in a negative or positive way.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And so with alcohol,
the rule of thumb

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is usually you want to
abstain from it for 24 hours

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.975 align:middle line:84%
before giving a reading
or receiving a reading.

00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's tie into
my Akashic Records.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Perfect.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is my book?

00:36:42.705 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: [CHUCKLES]
They're showing me this big.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't usually see books,
but the Guardians always

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.690 align:middle line:84%
share based on who is
asking the questions.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they're showing
me a book like this big.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the
Guardians think of me?

00:36:57.538 --> 00:36:59.205 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Oh, they
think you're lovely.

00:36:59.205 --> 00:37:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
showing me is you

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.550 align:middle line:84%
have these beautiful
angel wings that they

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.260 align:middle line:90%
want to make you aware of.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did I get them?

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Everyone has wings.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And so for you, they're wanting
you to become aware of them

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because it allows you to be more
present to the back of your body

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, like, the
back of your chakras

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and the energy in the back
of your body, which then can

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:90%
help you become more present.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I
have any past lives

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't be too proud of?

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: You've
had past lives.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to
rephrase "not proud of."

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
You've had past
lives that you've

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:84%
had challenges, interesting
experiences that

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:90%
have shaped you to who you are.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that you're
not proud of them,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
but some of the
behaviors and actions

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:84%
are, they're saying
questionable,

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that you would be, hmm, like
would scratch your head today

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:90%
and go, why would I do that?

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.556 align:middle line:84%
But it's the whole
experience of that lifetime.

00:38:03.556 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This lifetime
is in the communications.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.650 align:middle line:90%
I love broadcasting to people.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I love telling people stories.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I love communicating
with people.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Is that ability from the past?

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They're showing me-- they're
showing me where you used to be

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:90%
an announcer--

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.736 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In another life?

00:38:29.736 --> 00:38:30.536 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:38:30.536 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It's-- they're showing me
it's something similar to like

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:90%
a baseball game.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.957 align:middle line:90%
But it was a different sport.

00:38:40.957 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the sport is
because they're not telling me.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But you were an
announcer for some sort

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.330 align:middle line:90%
of athletic experience.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Like a game of some sort.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't in this lifetime.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a galactic lifetime.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't a human lifetime.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But you were an announcer
of that type of event.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.796 align:middle line:84%
But it was sports in the terms
that we would understand.

00:39:03.796 --> 00:39:05.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was one life?

00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, one life.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:90%
You were a sports announcer.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many lives
do you think I have?

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.595 align:middle line:90%
Will they tell you that?

00:39:11.595 --> 00:39:15.386 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They said
that you had 977.

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:17.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 977 lives?

00:39:17.795 --> 00:39:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Some were short
and some were long.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far back do I go?

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: You're ancient.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:90%
You're an ancient--

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was I a caveman?

00:39:25.805 --> 00:39:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: You were
one of the small--

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
so there's cavemen and
then there were tiny beings

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.580 align:middle line:90%
during the dinosaur age.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And you were one of the tiny
beings during the dinosaur age.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want
to be a tiny being.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: [LAUGHS]
There's different

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:84%
experiences that we had
in previous lifetimes,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and I've gotten to see
the tiny beings two times,

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and this would be my third
time I've gotten to see them.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But you were one
of the tiny beings,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and everything's
relative to perspective,

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:90%
but you were one of them.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they
foresee future lives?

00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yes, but
you have to understand

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that everything from
this moment in time

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.400 align:middle line:84%
is based on this moment
in time, what they answer.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so things reorganize
on a constant basis,

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
because we have free will,
and based on the decisions

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and based on our
reactions or non-reactions

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.260 align:middle line:84%
influence the present and
then influence the future.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And that determines
what we're doing.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But they can show us
parallel universes as well.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.525 align:middle line:90%
Parallel timelines.

00:40:31.525 --> 00:40:34.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I have any lives
where I died tragically?

00:40:34.195 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did I die?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: You died
on a pirate ship.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.803 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A pirate ship?

00:40:41.803 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: A pirate
ship went down

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.465 align:middle line:84%
and you died tragically when
the pirate ship went down.

00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was a pirate?

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I drowned?

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.326 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Mm-hmm.

00:40:51.326 --> 00:40:53.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who sank the ship?

00:40:53.982 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Enemy forces is
what they're showing me.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing me like
a cannonball of some sort.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hit the
ship and down I went.

00:41:01.495 --> 00:41:02.295 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Mm-hmm.

00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:05.053 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
lives did I have that?

00:41:05.053 --> 00:41:06.595 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Where
you died tragically?

00:41:06.595 --> 00:41:07.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:41:07.395 --> 00:41:10.686 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I'm seeing you
died in a knife fight once.

00:41:10.686 --> 00:41:11.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I'm seeing you die
of tuberculosis or something

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a disease?

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Like
some sort of disease

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:90%
that was running rampant.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
explain why I'm

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
so obsessed with
health supplementation

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:90%
and things like that now.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So that lifetime influenced
your ability to be more in tune

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.520 align:middle line:84%
to your physical body and to
trust your intuition-- when

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you're receiving that,
it's important for you

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:84%
to take a certain supplement
or a certain medicine

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.070 align:middle line:84%
or to even wear something
too, because our clothing can

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.365 align:middle line:90%
be medicine as well.

00:41:50.365 --> 00:41:53.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
happy with my lives?

00:41:53.996 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Oh, for sure.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:90%
They don't judge.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't judge.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No matter what?

00:41:59.615 --> 00:42:00.874 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Mm-mm.

00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we're having a messy
human experience and they

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:90%
want us to evolve.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.528 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you just had
a big argument with someone,

00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to judge
you for that argument.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.710 align:middle line:90%
They're going to love you.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.377 align:middle line:84%
They're going to show
that you are loved

00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to assist
you work through whatever

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:84%
it is that you need to work
through from that argument.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.380 align:middle line:90%
They never, ever judge.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't ever
judge any previous lifetime

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:84%
because they take into
consideration everything

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.550 align:middle line:90%
your soul has ever experienced.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And they answer it
from that perspective

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because they know who you
are from that perspective,

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.348 align:middle line:84%
because they can't just take
a sliver of your experiences,

00:42:38.348 --> 00:42:39.640 align:middle line:90%
they have to take in the whole.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I originate
on other planets?

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Am I an
Arcturian like you?

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: I see
you as a blue being.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time when I see
Arcturians, they're blue beings.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a blue being?

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.623 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Arcturians
are usually blue when I--

00:42:57.623 --> 00:42:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Avatars?

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Mm-hmm.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.752 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so they're showing
me as a blue being.

00:43:02.752 --> 00:43:04.995 align:middle line:84%
But you've had other
lifetimes, so they're

00:43:04.995 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
wanting me to explain this.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So when our soul
comes into being,

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:84%
we start with the
sacred geometry symbols.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
start on a planet.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We start with
sacred geometry when

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.640 align:middle line:90%
our essence comes into being.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we originate.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And you've had
Arcturian lifetimes.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure it does.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.666 align:middle line:90%
And will I still keep evolving?

00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.390 align:middle line:84%
You have lots of work to still
do in terms of what you're here

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.180 align:middle line:84%
for, your many purposes
are, but you've

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
reached a level of ascension
that you should be proud of,

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.940 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you thank
your guides for me?

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Absolutely.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.725 align:middle line:84%
And if you want, you
can thank them as well.

00:43:49.725 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you guides.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, is this back to you?

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I channel in the present.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So you're good.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was always you.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yeah.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I just interpret the information
and I channel it through.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is light language?

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Light language is the
cosmic language of your soul.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It can have symbols,
movements and sounds.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does it work?

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:16.472 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: How does
it work in terms of--

00:44:16.472 --> 00:44:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Communicating.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:18.597 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Communicating it.

00:44:18.597 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So with light language,
light language

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.415 align:middle line:84%
is like, we tune into
a radio station and--

00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:25.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Preferably mine.

00:44:25.545 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're fine tuning
to a radio station.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Not all stations are good.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Not everything in light
language we want to channel.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to tune
into the radio station

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:90%
that is to support us.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there's galactic light
codes and galactic beings that

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
support us in breaking through
what cannot be communicated

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in human words.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it positive to
work with light language?

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Yes, and we
need to use discernment

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
because there could
be some beings that

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.730 align:middle line:84%
communicate with you
in light language that

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:90%
have other agendas.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to make sure
that you're using discernment,

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.045 align:middle line:84%
like with anything in
our human experience.

00:45:09.045 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use
light language often?

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.072 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: Yes, I do.

00:45:12.072 --> 00:45:12.872 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works for you?

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBESON: I love it.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
started to receive

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:84%
guidance to start
sharing it publicly,

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
do it whatsoever

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because I thought it
was the strangest thing.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
doing it, my clients

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
were like, yes, this
is what we need.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have found
is there comes a point

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in our healing journey where
there's something else that

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
wants to communicate through
sacred geometry light codes that

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:84%
cannot be expressed
in human words.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it breaks
through the noise

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and brings those codes in for
us to receive really high power,

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.186 align:middle line:90%
high frequency healings.

00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, what's that
one message, that one

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:84%
important message you want
to impart on everybody

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:90%
about the Akashic Records?

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: That anyone, if
they're receiving guidance--

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and the record starts speaking
to people when they are ready,

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:90%
anyone can do it.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So don't worry about if you
don't feel psychic or not,

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that there's a reason why you're
receiving guidance to look at

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.073 align:middle line:90%
and to dive into the Records.

00:46:23.073 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Guardians are
wanting me to also share

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.990 align:middle line:84%
this message that you are
loved and you are always loved.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget your
light because your light

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:90%
is your beacon home.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
more information about you?

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: They can
go to my website.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It's theamyrobeson.com,
theamyrobeson.com.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I have free stuff on there.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I have information about the
Akashic Records, light language.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And if they go to
theamyrobeson.com/free,

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.148 align:middle line:10%
we have 20 plus free healings,
masterclasses and other things

00:46:53.148 --> 00:46:54.815 align:middle line:10%
that we give away for
free all the time.

00:46:54.815 --> 00:46:56.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amy, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:46:56.825 --> 00:46:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBESON: Thank
you for having me.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It was so much fun.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating talking
about your past lives,

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.880 align:middle line:90%
and she knows all about them.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many more she knows
that she didn't tell me about.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
