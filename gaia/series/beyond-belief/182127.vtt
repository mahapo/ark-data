>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we have
a very special guest for you

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Because all of us,
one day, will be faced

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
with the possibility of dying.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And the big question is, can you
die in a very comfortable way?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jessica Nutik
Zitter is with us,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
a national advocate
for transforming

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
the way people die in America.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.678 align:middle line:84%
That's right, I
said die in America.

Jessica, welcome to
the program, doctor.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JESSICA ZITTER: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were on the radio
show with me about a year

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
or so ago.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:10%
>>ZITTER: I think
it might have been

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:10%
two years ago when
my book and the movie

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:10%
came out at the same time.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:10%
And I was in this
whirlwind craziness.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.695 align:middle line:90%
So that's been a while.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
all over the country?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a very crazy time.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.978 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went
to medical school,

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
you went there to become what?

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I went there
to become a doctor.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And the kind of
doctor I wanted to be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:10%
was an intensive doctor who
used technology and treatments

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
and saved people's lives.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
So I became an intensive care
pulmonary and critical care

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:10%
doctor.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point did you switch

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.507 align:middle line:84%
into the area we're going to
talk about on the program now?

00:01:35.507 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It took a while.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I bought into this
idea that medicine

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
was about doing intensive
things to people,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
using machinery and new
and emerging technologies

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to save life, to scoop people
out from the jaws of death.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And it took me,
actually, several years

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
of this subtle realization
that I wasn't even talking

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
about that I was, actually,
sometimes doing more

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
harm than good to my patients.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I was actually sort
of stringing their bodies along,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
even patients who
I knew were dying.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
But I was kind of keeping
them alive as long as I

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
could at the ends of machines.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that your
job, to keep them alive

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:90%
as long as you can?

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: That's
what I had thought.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And so my job was simply
focused on the physiology of how

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.305 align:middle line:84%
do I keep the heart pumping
as long as possible,

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.555 align:middle line:90%
for every possible nanosecond?

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:23.758 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, just the heart.

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Just the heart.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
about the person?

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: That's right.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about the person.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't taught
about the person.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I had never been trained--

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, I
became less and less

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
able to look at
the whole person.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I became so focused
in on the physiology

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and the machines and
the disease diagnosis,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the person,
their reality, their family,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
their personal goals
and preferences.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what eventually
changed my approach.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But this isn't
quite hospice, is it?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: No.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you a
little bit about what

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that change was that I made,
that philosophical change.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: In the early
2000s, I happened to be,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:90%
by total chance--

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it was some
kind of a force from above--

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
by total chance, in a hospital
that was at the forefront--

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
a small little
hospital in Newark,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
New Jersey-- at the
forefront of a new

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
approach to caring for patients
in the intensive care unit.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
They had won this grant
that had been very coveted.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But only four hospitals
won it in the United States

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.735 align:middle line:90%
out of about 400 applications.

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's impressive.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It was
really exciting.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
anything about it.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.987 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was, all
of a sudden, there's

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
this family support team
in the intensive care unit.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They had won this
grant to enhance

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
communication between the
physicians and the patients.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
why do I need you?

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I already know how
to communicate.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good speaker.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I can communicate.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And they started to introduce
me to this new field, which

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
didn't even really become
recognized until 2008, called

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%
palliative medicine.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's only that--

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It's new.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --that old?

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It's new.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a new field.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And the point, the
real thrust, of that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
subspecialty, which I
would go on to learn,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
was that it was about
focusing on the whole patient,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
on a healthy,
communicative relationship,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
on making decisions with
them-- the health care team

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and the patient and
their family-- together

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that were really
tailored to the person,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
something I had never
thought about, never

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
been taught how to do.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
And so this family
support team would come in

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and criticize what I was doing.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one day, I
had an epiphany moment

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.353 align:middle line:84%
when the nurse, the head
of that team, came in.

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was putting a big
catheter into someone's neck

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
who was dying.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.615 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this
person was dying.

00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:90%
But it was the next thing to do.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me,
and she stood there.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.295 align:middle line:84%
She put her hand up
to her face like it

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
was a pretend telephone.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And she said, call the police.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
They're torturing a
patient in the ICU.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez!

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
And you hear this, right?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.612 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I heard this.

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're shocked.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And I was shocked,
and I was defensive,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
and I was angry.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
But over the next few
days, it seeped into me.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And it met with this
growing moral distress

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that I had been experiencing
over the previous several years

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that told me that
something was missing.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.153 align:middle line:84%
And I went to her, and I
said, OK, you know what?

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Teach me how to
do it differently.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And so she introduced
me to palliative care.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I became boarded
in palliative care medicine.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
practice both intensive care

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:90%
and palliative.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was the beginning of a
big philosophical shift for me.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was she saying
don't inject this patient?

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.177 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to help him?

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: She was saying a lot
of things in that one sentence.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And I always refer back to
it as my epiphany moment.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you see
this movie on Netflix--

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
"Extremis," which is
the movie that came out

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
two years ago that follows me
around in the intensive care

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:90%
unit--

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that moment.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talk
about that case.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Because it's such
a sentinel moment in my life.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
What she was saying
was many things.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
She was saying, why are you
doing this procedure that you

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and I both know
isn't going to help,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.682 align:middle line:84%
and you never even
told the husband

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't going to help?

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
You just let him
believe that you

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.788 align:middle line:84%
were going to just be able
to help by doing one more

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:90%
thing and one more thing.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
You never actually
were honest with him.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Where was the communication
and the human interaction

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
between you and that patient?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
things she was telling me.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
There were many other
things that she was saying.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.275 align:middle line:84%
But that was the gripping
piece of it for me.

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did you not even
know that this kind of care

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:90%
existed?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.243 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I didn't.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Let me say something
controversial about

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:90%
palliative care right now.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
The fact is the things
that palliative care tries

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize-- which are
communication, preferences,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
honoring a particular person's
preferences and values,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
eliciting those
preferences and values,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking about treating
their suffering,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.907 align:middle line:84%
all the kinds of suffering
they may be experiencing,

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's spiritual or
physical or emotional--

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that is all stuff,
when you really

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
think about it, that shouldn't
require a subspecialty.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: That's
stuff that should

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
be able to be dealt with by
every intensive care unit

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.725 align:middle line:90%
doctor, every cardiologist.

00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Normally.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.703 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It's part of medicine.

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It's part of treating a patient.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But the way American health
care has gone is we've become

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
so super-specialized and
so focused in on the stuff

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%
that's, honestly, easier--

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
which is adding one more
thing, trying one more thing--

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
instead of confronting
reality of death

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and dying, confronting the
angst of life ending, that we've

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
had to create a
subspecialty in order

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to do the stuff that really
should have been done anyways

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, there was
a TED conference.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And a Dr. BJ Miller--

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah, Miller, yeah.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know him?

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, yeah, very well.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A palliative care
doctor was there speaking.

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BJ MILLER: Now, the
American health care system

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
has more than its fair
share of dysfunction

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to match its
brilliance, to be sure.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm a physician, now, a hospice
and palliative medicine doc,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
so I've seen care
from both sides.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, most everyone
who goes into health care

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:90%
really means well--

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, truly.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
for a system that too
often does not serve.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.066 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:57.066 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's actually a pretty
easy answer to that question,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and it explains a lot.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Because health care was designed
with diseases, not people,

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
at its center, which
is to say, of course,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%
it was badly designed.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And nowhere are the effects of
bad design more heartbreaking,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
or the opportunity
for good design

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:84%
more compelling, than at the
end of life, where things are

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:90%
so distilled and concentrated.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no do-overs.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
My purpose today is to
reach out across disciplines

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
and invite design thinking
into this big conversation--

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that is, to bring
intention and creativity

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:90%
to the experience of dying.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
before a universal-- one of
the few universal-- issues,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, as well
as a civil society,

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to rethink and redesign
how it is we die.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder, doctor,
if his losing his limbs--

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
his legs-- had anything to do
with his change in attitude

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:90%
as a doctor.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well,
the thing about BJ

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is that he lost them
before he became a doctor.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So he had the
incredible privilege,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:84%
in a way, of coming
into medicine having

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
witnessed the other side.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to him?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
He had a situation where he
was joking around in college

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.115 align:middle line:84%
and got hurt while
playing around with some--

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A silly,
reckless thing.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Silly,
reckless thing, yeah.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you're
working with a patient,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to save
the patient, obviously.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
How many of them who come down
with diseases and illnesses

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
do you think will be dead
within a couple years?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well,
it really depends

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
on what the collection of
people you're talking about is.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:10%
If you're in an intensive
care unit, for example,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:10%
you can imagine that the
way this system works--

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:10%
I talk in my book
about something

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:10%
called an end-of-life conveyor
belt, that because we're not

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:10%
talking, because
we're not thinking

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:10%
about the person and their
preferences earlier on,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.628 align:middle line:10%
we just keep kicking the can
down the road and saying,

00:10:36.628 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:10%
well, we can try this,
and we can try that,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:10%
even as the patient
continues to deteriorate

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and, ultimately,
continues to die.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't acknowledge that.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk about it.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
We just keep doing
things to people.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
an ICU population,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we have this
end-of-life conveyor belt,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
the sickest people, the patients
who are closest to dying,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are ending up like a sieve
in the intensive care unit.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So of that population
of patients

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
who come into an intensive
care unit with serious illness,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:90%
many of them are dying.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are at the end.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And they had no idea.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that's most

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.245 align:middle line:84%
baffling and shocking to me
is how few people who I know,

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and who most of
the doctors know,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
are clearly dying have no
idea that they're dying.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, does
the palliative care--

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is its goal to make that person
comfortable before they die?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Or what is that?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well,
again, palliative care

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
isn't only geared towards
patients who are dying.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It's geared towards anybody
who has unmitigated suffering.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It could be someone who has
many years left to live.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The subset of patients
who are actually

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
dying who need
palliative care may

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
be people who are
appropriate for hospice.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's a small subset of
the whole potential offering.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would think the
medical community was always

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:84%
treating people well, at
any point in this illness.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You're saying
that's not the case.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: That to me, it seems
so logical that that's true,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that every doctor would
have as their goal

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to treat and to be
honest and to be

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
forthright with people
all through every stage

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
of their illness.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the sad and honest truth
is that that's not true.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:90%
We are not communicating.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:90%
We are not telling people.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.677 align:middle line:84%
There's a lack of
information transfer.

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:90%
It's really heartbreaking.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whose fault is that?

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It's very complicated.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It's no one person.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a culture.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Not only are doctors
not incentivized to tell

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:90%
the truth--

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
because, frankly,
it doesn't pay.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
What pays is to keep treating,
is to do that next procedure.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
We're also not
given enough time--

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do that operation.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.475 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Do that operation.

00:12:58.475 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get it done.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And it's not only
that it pays financially,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%
but it also pays emotionally.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You feel like a
better doctor if you

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
have something else
to offer, if you

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
have some other way of saying,
we're going to beat this.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what success
feels like, as a doctor.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say there's
also responsibility

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
on the sides of
patients and families.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come to doctors
with unrealistic expectations

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of what they can get, this
fantasy of perpetual life

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
that exists in our culture.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Look at "Gray's Anatomy."

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This doctor's
going to cure me.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll be saved.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.583 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: You guys should
be doing something else.

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And why aren't you trying this?

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
there's data upon data

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that shows that patients
don't like doctors

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
as much who give bad news
as they do like doctors

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:90%
who give good news.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact is if you're
going in just expecting

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.788 align:middle line:84%
from your doctor only
good news, you're

00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:90%
probably going to get it.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I know
people who will not

00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
go to the doctor, Jessica,
because they don't

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%
want to hear the bad news.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
say, wait a minute.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You want to hear
any kind of news

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
make yourself better.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid to get bad news.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Welcome it, and then attack it.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, you don't only
want to make yourself better.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But what about if you have a
serious, life-limiting illness,

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and you're actually dying?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
You also want that news so that
you're not pursuing fantasy

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
treatments that could
get you in trouble,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
like this end-of-life conveyor
belt where, just to tell you,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
there's an epidemic of
people dying on machines with

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
their arms tied down to the
bed with a tube in their mouth,

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and they cannot talk to you.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.193 align:middle line:84%
We have a huge number--
in fact, the data, recent,

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
showed hundreds of
thousands of patients

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
right now in the
United States who

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:84%
are lying in beds in
long-term acute care

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.725 align:middle line:84%
facilities attached
to breathing machines,

00:14:48.725 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
attached to machines, feeding
tubes, with their arms tied

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
down to their bed, who will
never come off of those.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.355 align:middle line:90%
That's a public health crisis.

00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want
to live that way.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Lots of people don't.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
Kevorkian comes in.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And his assisted suicide
probably made sense.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: But you don't even
need to go to that route.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't need assisted
suicide to live well

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:90%
until the very end.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:90%
You need to not--

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, how could you--

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.403 align:middle line:84%
OK, look, let me be the
devil's advocate for a moment.

00:15:15.403 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I hate using that word,
the devil, when you're

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.612 align:middle line:90%
talking about things like this.

00:15:18.612 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But how could you
have a comfortable way

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
out when you're strapped
in, a tube down your mouth,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:84%
another one up here,
and you're like that?

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: You don't need
to have those tubes.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can you be
comfortable like that?

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Because those
tubes never should

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
have been put in, probably.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, then, if you
pull them out, what happens?

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.593 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: People will die.

00:15:35.593 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is if we
know that someone's dying,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't given
them the chance

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to opt out of having this
tube put into their mouth,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
then we haven't done
our jobs as doctors.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
you're saying, though,

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is the odds are very
high that this patient is

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:90%
going to die soon.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's make him die as
comfortable as possible.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Let's allow him to
have a natural death filled

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
with support and aggressive
treatment of any symptoms that

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
come up but not using things
that are going to make it

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:90%
worse--

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.327 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Restrict him.

00:16:09.327 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: --and restrict him--

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
if that's what someone wants.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.912 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- a very small
minority because I talk

00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to people about
this all the time--

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:84%
some people would
say, I don't care.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Do everything.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.827 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if I'm
living on a machine.

00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if I can never
talk to my loved ones again.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if I have
to live in a facility.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.767 align:middle line:84%
Keep my heart beating
for every nanosecond.

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's a tiny minority
of people who would say that.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Pull the plug on me.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to live that way.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Or don't put
it in the first place

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:90%
so that there's a plug to pull.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're dying, do you really
want your body propped up

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
on machinery?

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.773 align:middle line:84%
And that's a decision
that should have

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:90%
been made before it happens.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Where is society today, in
terms of talking about death

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and just going through
that kind of scenario?

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.734 align:middle line:90%
Is it very forthright or not?

00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:58.078 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Not-- not.

00:16:58.078 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're afraid of it?

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: So many reasons.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
are afraid about death.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.742 align:middle line:84%
I think we're a
death-phobic society.

00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you go back
to ancient Greek myths,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:84%
there's myths about
living forever.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The myth of Eos and
Tithonus is a famous one.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
People want to live
forever-- this Fountain

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.567 align:middle line:90%
of Youth, miracle pills.

00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
can if you believe

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife, technically.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: True.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may not
be in a physical body,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
but you may continue.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But what we are doing
here on this life

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is we're using all of
these technologies,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're just sort of trying
to keep this life going forever.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.415 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing
immeasurable suffering.

00:17:34.415 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it change?

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many doctors
are like you that do this?

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It's
starting to change--

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:90%
much too slowly.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Because even when you
get people to cognitively

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
agree and to learn
skills of communication

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and to see a different way, when
the emotion of serious illness

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is happening, people
tend to revert back

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.908 align:middle line:84%
to what we are most comfortable
with, which is just to say,

00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:02.325 align:middle line:84%
well, let's do this, and let's
do that, and let's do this.

00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So we're starting to change.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.473 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to teach
our medical students

00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and our nursing students about
a different way to communicate,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
about how to communicate,
valuing communication

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and decision-making
that's difficult.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.048 align:middle line:84%
But we're not nearly
where we need to be.

00:18:18.048 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's not just
the health care community

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.488 align:middle line:84%
that needs to change and
develop these skills.

00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the community at large
that needs to start saying,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I do want the truth
from my doctors.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I do want to do decision-making
in advance of me becoming

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:90%
so sick and so desperate.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to make the
decisions about how I want

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:90%
to live earlier on upstream.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Is the care also for the living
who know the dying person?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Because they go through grief.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy
on them, either.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, yes.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
My father died pretty darn fast.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:90%
He was 88 years old.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty darn good run.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, yeah.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My sister died in her
early 50s of a brain tumor.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.185 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't a good run.

00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, terrible.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you have
two different deaths.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
One was a little easier for me
to accept than the other one.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how many people
have to go through that?

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.667 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, interesting
you bring this up.

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We have a movie that we're
just about to release

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that's in post-production now
about a woman in my community

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
who was dying.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was doing
everything right.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It was all just so beautiful.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:90%
We called in hospice.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
We got all the attention
to support her.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
She had a very, very
supportive religious community.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Her sons came and flew from
overseas with their guitars.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was-- it was
doing everything right.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.945 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I initially
wanted to make this film

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
was to show how death
can be beautiful.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can make
a beautiful death.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the course of
this film, as you watch it,

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
is that she goes on to have
a very, very difficult death

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.432 align:middle line:84%
with all the right
things in place.

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mean physically?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Physically and
financially and emotionally.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It was just very exhausting
and very difficult.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And her husband-- it
was very tough on them.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this film has
become, actually,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
not about a beautiful death
but about caregiver burden

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.822 align:middle line:84%
and the burden on those
around the dying patient.

00:20:15.822 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's huge.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.155 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And we don't even
think about that as a society

00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
or figure out how to
support those caregivers.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But the worst thing, besides the
physical suffering and watching

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that, the worst thing
that caregivers or loved

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:32.133 align:middle line:84%
ones experience is when
their loved one is dying

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
a death that they
don't think they

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
would have wanted-- for
example, on machines.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.565 align:middle line:84%
But they don't feel comfortable
saying, you know what?

00:20:38.565 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It's time to
release the machine.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.398 align:middle line:84%
It's time to take
away the machine.

00:20:41.398 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that feels
so overwhelmingly--

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
such a huge responsibility.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And most people should never
be put in that position.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.627 align:middle line:84%
That conversation should have
been had many, many years

00:20:51.627 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
earlier to figure out, I know
what my father would want.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't want to
be on this machine.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sudden
death is tougher than

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:90%
a long-term, expected death.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Because when it's sudden--

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
and I've gone through that, too.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine who died
of an overdose of prescription

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:90%
pills.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody expected that to happen.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Those kind are really difficult.
Because as the living,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
you go through these stages
of why did this happen?

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
You get angry.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
You question things.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:90%
The sudden ones are rough.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You get a call from
the police and say

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
your son got killed
in a car accident.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't expect those.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I can also tell
you that long ones can

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:90%
be really tough, too.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.365 align:middle line:84%
So much of it depends on
whether or not the way it goes

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with what's
important to that person.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like torture but longer.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.175 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It can
be like torture.

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it many, many times.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why good preparations
and honesty can mitigate that

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:90%
and make it much better.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
talked about four things

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.705 align:middle line:90%
we can do to prepare for dying.

00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I'm a physician who
really loves to save life.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But I also have come to learn
about the beauty of having

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
a good death.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:10%
A good death is really personal.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Each person has their own
preferences and values.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we can match
those as they're dying,

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:90%
that is a good death.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
achieve a good death,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I think there are several
steps that people can take.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
The first is you
need to acknowledge

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to all die.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:10%
The second is to
prepare for that day.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Third, you really need
to be able to communicate

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
those preferences and
values to your loved ones

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.962 align:middle line:90%
and to your health care team.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone
needs to know what

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
they are in order to enable
you to have your life

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that you want all the
way up until the end.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, I think it's
really, really important

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have a much more
collaborative approach

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to managing patients
at the end of life.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Because while the doctor might
be the expert in the disease,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the patient is really the
expert in the patient.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.458 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I just am
just so happy that--

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So looking at
those patients, doctor,

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:84%
are they in the hospital
to die, or are they

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital thinking
they're going to get cured?

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.202 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It's a good question.

00:23:25.202 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them think
not necessarily

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to get cured
but that we're going to just

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
be able to keep them
going and going and going,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
which may not mean cure but
just keep them going and going.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Both of those
patients were dying.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sadly.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Sadly.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different ages, too.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
She was very young.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The woman
was very young.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Very young, yeah.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
need to be in the hospital

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they do this at home?

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: They can.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We can, actually, manage
patients at home who are dying.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's what hospice is.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
The fact is these
patients both came in

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
because they were suffering
with physical symptoms,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't have any support
in the home to manage it.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
So they came into the hospital.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Both of those patients ended
up going home on hospice

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
once we were able to
clarify with them,

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and they understood
that they were dying

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and that we wanted to make
whatever time we had left

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
the best that it
could be-- allow them

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to be home with their families,
and allow them to feel

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.125 align:middle line:90%
as comfortable as possible.

00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the young
lady's husband, for example,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:90%
who was sitting next to her?

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.912 align:middle line:90%
What was he going through?

00:24:33.912 --> 00:24:36.253 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Oh, it
was heartbreaking--

00:24:36.253 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:90%
heartbreaking heartbreaking.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: He was an amazing man,
an amazing, supportive husband.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:90%
He just wanted to care for her.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:90%
He knew she was dying.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But they just weren't
talking about it.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.953 align:middle line:90%
They weren't accepting it.

00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:49.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old was she?

00:24:49.995 --> 00:24:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: She was-- oh,
I'm trying to remember.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30s?

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: No, she was
probably in her late 20s.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And what happened was
when we started to talk with

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.867 align:middle line:84%
them about the real
fact of her dying,

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
which no one had talked about--
she'd been sick for years with

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
this illness--

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:90%
it was a relief for them.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is when
people are this sick,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:84%
they know, and
their families know,

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that things are
really not right.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But when no one's
wanting to admit it,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
there's this tension and
this sort of dancing around

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:90%
the truth that is exhausting.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you can actually bring
in the truth to an encounter,

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
there is a tremendous
amount of relief

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.443 align:middle line:84%
and then positive planning for,
OK, so how do we go forward?

00:25:34.443 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about the
older gentleman with his older

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:90%
wife that was there?

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Does she expect him to die?

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And is that a different
kind of approach?

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Again, same story.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
That family, also, no one
was really actively talking

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:90%
about death or not death.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
They were just going
from symptom to symptom

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and wanting something from us
to keep the symptoms at bay

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and to keep him going
as long as possible.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And those goals are all things
that can be achieved better

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:90%
with hospice.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
If I needed to be in the
hospital for an operation,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that's where I'd go.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Exactly.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They do a
great job for that.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.122 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right, exactly.

00:26:16.122 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if I
don't need that,

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to do everything at home.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Most people do--

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
not everybody, but
most people do.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is we're not
giving people those options.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.678 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
telling them the truth.

00:26:27.678 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not addressing and facing
the truth earlier and upstage.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
overprescribing of medicine

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:90%
and prescription drugs?

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.402 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a problem, too.

00:26:40.402 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It is.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a big problem.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big part of
what's fueling this problem.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, there are always,
as you know, new things coming

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
up in our health
care system that are

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.882 align:middle line:90%
the new promise and the new--

00:26:58.882 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The new technology,
the new something.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: The new
type of chemotherapy

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that's not going
to make you sick,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%
but it's going to save you.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:90%
The fact is that's exciting.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the beautiful
promises of American medicine.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is those
saves, those miracle cures,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:84%
only work for a small
number of people.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.903 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, they don't
necessarily cure the disease.

00:27:21.903 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They may give you an
extra three months.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
They may give you an extra
year, maybe an extra two years.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But everyone thinks when
there's this small outlier

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
option available that
they're going to be the one

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:90%
to benefit from it--

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
again, that
unrealistic thinking,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:90%
that false-hope-based thinking.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that there
aren't things that can

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:90%
be wonderful that can happen.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But people are so wanting that
to be-- and the doctors, too--

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
we're so wanting to
live with that belief

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that this cure can work for you
that we don't actually, again,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
address the reality
on the ground

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, this
is probably not

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
going to necessarily work the
way we're all hoping it will.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.143 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going to do when
that happens and make a plan?

00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say,
Jessica, in your experience--

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and you've been doing
this for how long

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.822 align:middle line:90%
now, the palliative care?

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Many years-- well,
palliative care since 2008.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
What would you say would be
one of your happier moments

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:90%
doing this as a doctor?

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us a case?

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.311 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, so many--

00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:90%
so many.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:10%
One of the cases is actually
the epilogue in my book.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:10%
The name I use is Marcia Green,
but the woman's real name

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:10%
was Stephanie Rovid.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was a woman
who I actually cared

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:90%
for in the intensive care unit.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:90%
She came in.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:90%
She had cancer.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
She'd had it for many years.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:90%
But she was going to fight it.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying
to her oncologist,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:90%
give me everything you've got.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And as these chemotherapies
kept not really working,

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and the cancer kept advancing,
she kept saying, give me more.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Give me another one.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.325 align:middle line:84%
And the way we
work in medicine is

00:28:55.325 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
we say, well, she wants more, so
we give it to them, even if we

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.933 align:middle line:90%
don't think it's going to help.

00:28:59.933 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So she kept getting one
course of chemotherapy

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:90%
after another after another.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And she was getting sicker and
sicker and sicker and sicker.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
By the time I met her,
I was her ICU doctor

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:90%
because she was in shock.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%
She had no blood pressure.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:90%
She was dying.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:29:12.853 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And so she came
in, and we resuscitated her.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:90%
We were lucky.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, by the
time someone's in shock,

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:90%
we can't save them.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:90%
But we resuscitated her.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:84%
We got her back up, sort
of like pumping up a tire.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.773 align:middle line:90%
But this was a leaky tire.

00:29:25.773 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:90%
It was just going to--

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was going
to deflate again.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.593 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: --deflate again.

00:29:28.593 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But my initial
thing was, OK, good.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:90%
We got this job done.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's send her to the floor.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized,
if I don't talk

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to this woman about the fact
that this isn't working,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
my colleagues out
on the floors aren't

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
going to talk to her
about that, either.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And I need to talk
to her about it.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into her room
to talk to her about it.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
scariest things

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I did because her
family had taped up

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.948 align:middle line:84%
a huge sign in her room
that said, "no bad news."

00:29:52.948 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And I knew they didn't
want to hear any bad news.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought
that was a motivator.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.105 align:middle line:84%
That's probably what
they did that for.

00:29:57.105 --> 00:29:59.105 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: They thought
it was going to give them

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.437 align:middle line:90%
energy to keep going.

00:30:00.437 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down on
the side of the bed,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%
and I told them the truth.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It was very painful.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:90%
They got very angry at me.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.898 align:middle line:90%
They threw me out of the room.

00:30:09.898 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And a couple days later,
I went to check on them.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They were up on the
floor at this point.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that they had
actually heard what I had said.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Even though they kicked
me out of the room,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and they yelled at
me, and they told me

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I was a terrible doctor--

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They listened.

00:30:21.868 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: --they listened.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up
going home on hospice

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and not doing any
more chemotherapy.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my husband said,
she chose Cabernet--

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:84%
because she was a big wine
enthusiast-- over chemo,

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
went home and had two months
of a beautiful, beautiful,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:90%
beautiful chunk of her life.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, she died in her home
with her grandchildren around.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I feel really,
really good about that.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But I have many,
many more examples

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
like that that I can tell you.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's too bad that
we can't cure these diseases.

00:30:52.253 --> 00:30:53.683 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, well.

00:30:53.683 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too bad.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.235 align:middle line:90%
Maybe one day--

00:30:55.235 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Maybe one day.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --technology will
be able to do that, too.

00:30:57.955 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's bizarre
how cells go rampant

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and change everything else.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: They do.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of sick
people out there, Jessica.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Well, yeah.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And currently, death
basically has 100% prevalence.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dies.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So whether we can push
it off a little bit,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
happen to all of us.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us the premise of
your book, "Extreme Measures."

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: "Extreme
Measures" is really--

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
it's both a memoir
showing my movement

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
from one philosophy of care to
another and all the patients

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and colleagues and
experiences I've

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:84%
had along the way, the
difficulty of moving

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
into this new
approach and how it

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:84%
rubs against the
current medical culture

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and causes conflict, but
also the beauty of it

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and how we can have some
really amazing experiences,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
like Stephanie Rovid,
like I just explained.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a call
to action for not only

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
our medical culture to change
the way we're thinking of,

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
as BJ Miller put it, not just
about focusing on the disease

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:90%
but focusing on the person.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:84%
BJ wrote the main
blurb for my book.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The call to action is to focus
on the person, not the disease.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.355 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has this made
you a better doctor?

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.032 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I would
say yes, for sure.

00:32:19.032 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't teach
you this in medical school.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.375 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: No, not yet.

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They should.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: They should.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should
have a course.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.707 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: They should.

00:32:25.707 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:90%
We're working on it.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
take a lot of changing

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.373 align:middle line:84%
in the way we think about how
to teach medical students.

00:32:31.373 --> 00:32:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, is it because
doctors don't understand,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
not caring enough?

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:90%
What's lacking?

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: What's lacking
is several things.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.512 align:middle line:84%
What's lacking is
the tools to know

00:32:45.512 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:90%
how to do communication well.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because communication is
not just a natural thing.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Breaking bad news
is really hard.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Standing strong in the face
of onslaught of emotion

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.820 align:middle line:84%
from your patients,
it's very hard.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:90%
You need to be trained to do it.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It takes lots of
hours of practice--

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:90%
repeating, repeating, repeating.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
That is one thing
that's got to be

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
put into place is really firm
training and communication

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.330 align:middle line:90%
skills.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Number two, the infrastructure
has got to change.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you can't expect to
see seven patients in clinic

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in an afternoon-- in
a pulmonary clinic--

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.437 align:middle line:84%
and actually talk
to those patients--

00:33:19.437 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Each one of them.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.575 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: --about
end-of-life planning.

00:33:22.575 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of those
patients are coming in

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
with end-stage COPD or end-stage
lung diseases or heart diseases

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:90%
or kidney diseases.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.115 align:middle line:84%
And no one's talking
to them about what

00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:90%
their preferences are.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They should be having
these conversations

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
before they hit the intensive
care unit, before they've

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.498 align:middle line:90%
gotten intubated.

00:33:38.498 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of these
patients would never

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:84%
want to be intubated if they
understood what it meant.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The host of my
radio show years ago,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
who was the founder,
died a year ago.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And he had severe COPD--

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:90%
severe.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And the coroner
said it was death

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
by an overdose of
prescription pills.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:90%
That's how they left it.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It must be very
difficult for somebody

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:13.040 align:middle line:84%
who is at that stage in life to
keep pushing and carrying on,

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.730 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
breathe on your own.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be horrible.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, those
of us who have

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.360 align:middle line:84%
been trained in
managing symptoms,

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and really addressing
and managing symptoms--

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
like shortness of breath, for
example, anxiety, itching,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.700 align:middle line:84%
GI distress, all the things
that can come with end-stage

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:90%
illness--

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
we have more than
a 90% success rate

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of getting those kinds of
symptoms under control.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem is very few
patients have access

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to the kinds of expertise
that we in palliative care

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
or hospice can bring.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they're suffering without
good, aggressive treatment

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:90%
of those symptoms.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a video explaining
the kind of work you do.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.226 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Sure.

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING ON VIDEO]

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: My name
is Jessica Zitter,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and I am a physician who
practices both intensive care

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:84%
medicine and palliative
care medicine.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So palliative care is
an approach to medicine

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that really looks
at the whole patient

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and tries to account for
all of the patient's needs,

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:84%
not just the needs of
individual organ systems.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
"Extreme Measures" started out
as a collection of writings

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:84%
from my early career,
when I was really

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
suffering in the intensive care
unit with no other paradigm

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and watching a lot of
suffering of my patients.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.050 align:middle line:10%
I do believe that there is a
public health crisis right now

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:10%
with people dying badly.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I have
a front row seat to it

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in the intensive care unit.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So many people
come there on what

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I call the end-of-life
conveyor belt.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they end up
attached to machines

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and unable to live
independently.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:84%
The book really became
more of a vision of how

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:90%
we can do things differently.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It is scary to talk about death.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:90%
It's scary to think about death.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time
talking to my family

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:84%
about death and
preferences and values.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And it gets a little bit
less scary each time.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
brought us closer.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PATIENT: I want
to go peacefully.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I'm a physician who
really loves to save life.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But I also have come to learn
about the beauty of having

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:90%
a good death.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:90%
A good death is really personal.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Each person has their own
preferences and values.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we can match
those as they're dying,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.833 align:middle line:90%
that is a good death.

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll talk about
how people can get your book.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Great.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sad, though, isn't it?

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Sad but also
kind of beautiful.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Because again, let's accept it.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's remember everyone dies--

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.955 align:middle line:90%
everyone.

00:36:53.955 --> 00:36:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's true.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: So how
do we want to die?

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.213 align:middle line:84%
How do we want to live
until the very end?

00:36:59.213 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that can
be really beautiful

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:90%
when we can achieve that.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The end-of-life
conveyor belt theory

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about, explain
that a little bit more.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It's this automatic
default without conversation,

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:84%
attachment of new machines
and tubes and treatments

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:90%
to a person.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's very
cold, isn't it?

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.407 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It's
very cold, sterile.

00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:90%
It's completely depersonalized.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just a protocol.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't in any way based
on a person, on their prognosis,

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
on their preferences,
on how they want to go.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it because,
Jessica, the medical community

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:40.480 align:middle line:84%
thinks for a moment they're
going to cure that person?

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to put
them in this situation.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put
tubes down their throat.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to inject
them every day.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just do all
these horrendous things

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to try to save them because
maybe just one person is going

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to be able to walk out of here.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Do they think that?

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I think
that it's complicated.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take the
subset of patients

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that we actually know are dying,
and we're still doing that,

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you took a blind
poll, an anonymous poll,

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and asked the doctors caring
for a whole group of patients

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
who are dying, do
you think this person

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.333 align:middle line:84%
has any chance of getting out
of the intensive care unit

00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:84%
or of ever getting
out of the hospital?

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
you would see that a huge
number of the patients who

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
we are putting on the
end-of-life conveyor

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.205 align:middle line:84%
belt every doctor thinks
is not going to survive.

00:38:30.205 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would say, yeah.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: So why
are we doing that?

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nine out
of 10, probably.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Why are we doing that?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you
why we're doing that.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not because we think
they're going to go home.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I just said, these are
patients that we don't think--

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it money?

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It's a
combination of, I

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
think, probably most
important, it's easier.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to just keep
doing things to people

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.035 align:middle line:84%
than it is to talk to people
about difficult stuff.

00:38:53.035 --> 00:38:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, sadly,
it's also profitable.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: And it is profitable.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much does it cost
to have those people in those

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.160 align:middle line:84%
hospital rooms to die if they
last a month or two months

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
or three months--

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: 100%

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --than
if they went home?

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:90%
So agree with you.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Profit is a huge motive.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
sad and scary reality

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
in this country, how the
profit motive impacts

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:90%
the way we care for patients.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.882 align:middle line:84%
But then, I would say one of
the most important things,

00:39:19.882 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
which I talked about
before, is the sense

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:90%
of how it feels as a doctor.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
What makes you feel
like a success?

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel successful
when you just

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:84%
come in with a packet of
some new catheter to instill,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and you get it done, and
then you clean up the mess?

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Does that make you
feel successful?

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Or does telling
someone that you think

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
they're dying and having them
throw you out of the room

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
make you feel successful?

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I would venture to
say it's a lot easier,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and it makes you feel--

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
at least in the moment-- a lot
more successful as a doctor

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.778 align:middle line:84%
to have put your catheter
in and cleaned up and tidied

00:39:50.778 --> 00:39:52.320 align:middle line:84%
up and walked on to
the next patient.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does your mindset
change if the patient is

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.350 align:middle line:84%
a little child, and maybe by
putting them on all these types

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of medicines and things
like that in the hospital--

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
though it's a
horrible little way

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:90%
for a little person to live--

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:90%
could cure them at that age?

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: That's an
excellent question.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a pediatrician.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.028 align:middle line:84%
I don't take care
of little people.

00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:90%
But I will say one thing.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I take care of 20-year-olds.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:90%
I take care of 30-year-olds.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I take care of 80-year-olds.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And even young people die.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And plenty of young people die.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And plenty of my
patients who are

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
young and in their 30s with four
kids and who are nice people

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:90%
die.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't accept
that, that they're dying,

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
when I physiologically
realize that they are,

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:84%
then I am doing
them a disservice.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Because again, whether
you're a pediatrician

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's a baby or
a child, or you're

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about an
80-year-old person,

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
if someone is
actually dying, you

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to be
realistic and honest

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and plan accordingly
and not just

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.480 align:middle line:90%
do things based on false hope.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
mindset to change the way

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
people in the health
community approach this?

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you get them--

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Good question.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to change
their attitudes

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.953 align:middle line:90%
and the way they do things?

00:41:09.953 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I think a lot
of it's about culture.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I just spoke about how
we think of success as saving

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.250 align:middle line:84%
people, or we think
of success as being

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
able to do a good procedure,
regardless of the outcome,

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
we need to change our
idea of what makes success

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to be focused on what's
successful for the patient--

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:90%
patient-focused outcomes.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We need to think about
quality of life more.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We need to think about a good
death as being successful,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.185 align:middle line:90%
compared to a death on machines.

00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.473 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: We need
to be able to change

00:41:40.473 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:84%
what the definition of being a
good doctor, a valuable doctor,

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the people who
are most valued in medicine

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
are the people who do
the procedures, who

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.040 align:middle line:84%
make the money at doing
those intensive procedures.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we valuing
doctors who communicate?

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we valuing doctors
who focus on the family system?

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not valuing that at all.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to change
that culture of what

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.222 align:middle line:90%
is considered success.

00:42:07.222 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the first
things I think we need to do.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
be a lot of work.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is a
lot of work, isn't it?

00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:13.175 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:42:13.175 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And like
we were saying,

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the medical schools need
to start training people

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:84%
in their young 20s, when
they're in school, to understand

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:90%
this a little bit more.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.675 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Yeah,
definitely, definitely.

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:27.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
about the health care community,

00:42:27.133 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
overall?

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.830 align:middle line:84%
What would you
give it as a grade

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.617 align:middle line:90%
in terms of curing people?

00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, there's so many
different things to grade them

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:90%
on, right?

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're grading
on curing people,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I think, oh, it's
a hard question.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A C?

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It just depends
on the subset of illness

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.323 align:middle line:84%
and the medical problem
you're talking about.

00:42:51.323 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the biggest
problem with our health

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:90%
care in America is the system.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the people who come
into it care about patients.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I think, as BJ Miller
said, we're good people.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We're here because we
care, for the most part.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.470 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to do the
right thing by people.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But the system impedes
us from doing that.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got this
broken system which

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is hyper-focused on
diseases, hyper-focused

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:90%
on specialization.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We are not looking holistically
at our population of people

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:90%
who come to us for help.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the system
is really, really broken.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's,
actually, very broken.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd give it a C. I'd
give it a C. I think

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
we have some great technological
things that we're creating

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.115 align:middle line:84%
and developing, and
for that, that's an A.

00:43:35.115 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's a small
subset of people who

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:90%
are going to benefit from that.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Very small.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is it in
the next 15 or 20 years?

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:90%
How does it change?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: There are
some things I think

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.800 align:middle line:90%
that are going to get better.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And some things, I
think, might get worse.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
What might get
better is, as I said,

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to think about
training our trainees to focus

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:84%
slightly on what is really
success, maybe to change

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that definition, to focus
on communication skills

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and the importance
of breaking bad news.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
something that's positive.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I hope the field
of palliative care

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
will lead the way for all
the other subspecialties

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.610 align:middle line:84%
to do what they should
be doing already, right?

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The thing I worry
about getting worse

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is with every new
development that comes out

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.280 align:middle line:84%
in every little
commercial you see on CNN

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.090 align:middle line:84%
in the break about
some new Spiriva

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.770 align:middle line:84%
or some new COPD medication
or some new targeted

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy--

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the disclaimers
are unbelievable.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're horrible.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.995 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: But the
biggest problem

00:44:33.995 --> 00:44:39.470 align:middle line:84%
is that it fuels this fantasy
that we're going to cure death.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is this collusion
between all of us--

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:84%
doctors and patients
and families alike--

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow are
moving towards the idea

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:90%
that we can cure death.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's
a realistic way for us

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.660 align:middle line:90%
to be thinking as a society.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
know they actually

00:44:56.077 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
want to clone our bodies,
download our memories,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.980 align:middle line:84%
store them, and then put
them into the cloned body,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and it would be us forever?

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
get to a certain age,

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.790 align:middle line:90%
they clone your body again.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:15.473 align:middle line:84%
They raise it, and they download
the memory into this brain.

00:45:15.473 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think, one day, they're
going to be able to do that,

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:19.430 align:middle line:90%
technically.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And who are we but our memories
and our brains and our thought

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.780 align:middle line:90%
patterns?

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We could occupy any
body, any physical body.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you still have
your memory intact,

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.305 align:middle line:90%
that's who you are.

00:45:33.305 --> 00:45:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You may look at your
body and go, well,

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like the
old one better.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
they get to that point

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.420 align:middle line:84%
where they can download
memory into a cloned body?

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:90%
You'd literally live forever.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, if
it ever happens,

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I'd
want it for myself.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we
are so far from that

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that I want to focus on helping
the people who are here right

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.570 align:middle line:84%
now, suffering from our
current system, which

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is just causing a devastating
public health crisis.

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
find that religion

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:90%
gets in the way of any of this?

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Hmm, that's
a good question.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Religion is a stand-in
for the human brain.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
religion can sometimes

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:84%
be helpful for people,
and sometimes it

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:84%
can get in the way
of them processing

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%
towards a good death.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people just say, I
don't want to talk about it.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I believe in miracles.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And that shuts down
the conversation.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have any kind
of a further conversation.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people's
faith gives them

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.420 align:middle line:84%
the courage to face this
important discussion.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I wouldn't
say that religion

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.210 align:middle line:90%
makes it better or worse.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen it make
it both better and worse.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a Catholic priest

00:46:45.167 --> 00:46:48.680 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Gerald Coleman
who talks about end-of-life

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.572 align:middle line:90%
with regards to the church.

00:46:51.572 --> 00:46:53.030 align:middle line:10%
>>GERALD COLEMAN:
End-of-life care,

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.020 align:middle line:10%
in terms of Catholic teaching,
rests upon the dignity

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.530 align:middle line:10%
and sanctity of human life
and that every person has

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:10%
fundamental intrinsic
dignity because we

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:10%
were created in God's image.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.180 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, when
a person is reaching

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.060 align:middle line:10%
the end of his or her
life, we treat the person

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:10%
always from that perspective.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.330 align:middle line:10%
They have human dignity.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And even though they may
be limited physically

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.240 align:middle line:10%
or emotionally or whatever
the limitation might be,

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:10%
we always treat the person
having human dignity.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
church's long tradition,

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.870 align:middle line:10%
that
proportionate/disproportionate

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:10%
or ordinary/extraordinary
treatment,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.040 align:middle line:10%
comes into play,
that because we want

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.500 align:middle line:10%
to respect the human
life of the individual,

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.040 align:middle line:10%
certain treatments can
become extraordinary or

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.540 align:middle line:10%
disproportionate.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.370 align:middle line:10%
And if we could demonstrate
that that is the case,

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:10%
then the person has
no moral obligation

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:10%
to pursue or undertake
that treatment because

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:10%
of their human dignity.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And the question of
nutrition and hydration,

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.270 align:middle line:10%
that's a very long,
complicated one.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:10%
But to put it very briefly is
that because of human dignity,

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.650 align:middle line:10%
considering the person's
circumstance and illness,

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:14.040 align:middle line:10%
we presume to give that person
medically-assisted nutrition

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and hydration if it is
shown that helping with,

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:10%
medically, nutrition
and hydration is

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.730 align:middle line:10%
going to assist the
person's human dignity

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:10%
and is not burdensome.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.990 align:middle line:10%
If it becomes
burdensome, then there's

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:10%
no obligation to do
it in the first place,

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:34.650 align:middle line:10%
or there is an obligation, or a
permission, to cease doing it.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.230 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
palliative care, doesn't it?

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:84%
They're saying if it's not going
to prolong life in a good way,

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:45.900 align:middle line:90%
don't do it.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge thing that this
statement, which I believe

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:84%
was reasonably over
the past few years,

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that the pope said that tube
feeding was not a requirement.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:90%
It used to be that it was.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Keep 'em alive.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Keep 'em alive.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Keep 'em alive.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:07.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge move for
the Catholic community.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.300 align:middle line:84%
What I think is really
important to understand

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is that the data show that in
many, many kinds of conditions,

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:84%
as life starts to ebb,
as people start to die,

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.865 align:middle line:84%
as dementia takes its toll and
prevents you from swallowing

00:49:19.865 --> 00:49:21.990 align:middle line:84%
correctly-- which is one
of the things that happens

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:25.200 align:middle line:84%
in dementia-- that giving
people feeding through tubes

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:84%
can actually make
them die sooner

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.540 align:middle line:90%
and cause tremendous suffering.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So we think of food as this
emotional thing, as caring.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a cultural thing for us.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't think of it as
a medical intervention.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is food is a
medical intervention, just

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:84%
like any other type of
medical intervention.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And we need to not
force it on people

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.250 align:middle line:90%
when it won't cause benefit.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How involved
do the family members

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.210 align:middle line:90%
get in these decisions, as well?

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
talking to a patient

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and he's got family members
around, do they get involved?

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Absolutely.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.650 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in the
intensive care unit,

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, patients
usually can't talk to you.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be talking
to their family members.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
That is when the surrogate
decision-maker is, essentially,

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.740 align:middle line:84%
the decision-maker standing
in for the patient.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real
problem in our society.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact
is most families

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
have not had an
honest conversation

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.250 align:middle line:90%
about death and dying.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You saw me and my kids
and my husband sitting

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.033 align:middle line:84%
around talking about,
well, I would want this,

00:50:28.033 --> 00:50:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and I would want that.

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Most families haven't done that.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have a patient
all of a sudden not able

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.780 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you, and there
was no advance conversations

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.520 align:middle line:84%
with the family, and
then you're relying

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.010 align:middle line:84%
on this surrogate decision-maker
to make all the decisions,

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:84%
well, they're going to be
like, well, I don't know.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I never talked about it.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to err on
the side of prolonging life.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
people then end up

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.250 align:middle line:84%
getting trapped who may never
have wanted to be on machines.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Because their loved one,
well-intentioned, just

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.220 align:middle line:84%
never felt comfortable and never
felt they had the permission

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:90%
to say take that tube out.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why these conversations
must happen upstream.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people expect a miracle?

00:51:06.957 --> 00:51:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I don't know
that it's necessarily

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:84%
a miracle in the sense
of God doing something

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.630 align:middle line:90%
like raising Lazarus.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of people have
this hidden belief and fantasy

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:90%
that the health care system--

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.920 align:middle line:84%
hospitals, doctors--
is somehow going

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pull something
out of their pocket

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.810 align:middle line:84%
at the 11th hour to
just keep them going.

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is a little bit of
fantasy thinking and miracle

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:84%
thinking, and I would call
it, sometimes, false hope.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a circumstance,

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.840 align:middle line:84%
or have you witnessed anything,
where you knew this person was

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.940 align:middle line:84%
going to die and, all of
a sudden, they didn't?

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.212 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you brought that up.

00:51:45.212 --> 00:51:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that in my book.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
important phenomenon.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Very rarely has
that happened to me.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And I've actually pulled--

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.390 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote my book, I
wanted to ask other ICU

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.080 align:middle line:84%
doctors and other doctors if
they had had experiences where

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.870 align:middle line:84%
they thought someone was
absolutely-- they were sure

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that someone was going to
die, and they didn't, and how

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:07.680 align:middle line:90%
did that impact them?

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.462 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, again,
like me, very few people

00:52:10.462 --> 00:52:11.295 align:middle line:90%
had that experience.

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right--
doesn't happen a lot.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.983 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It doesn't
happen that much.

00:52:13.983 --> 00:52:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And second of all,
when it happens,

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:84%
it can impact your practice
for years in a bad way.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.670 align:middle line:84%
If you've had one
unexpected person do better

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:28.500 align:middle line:84%
than you thought they
were going to do,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.670 align:middle line:84%
it can make you hesitant
to ever render--

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mean as a doctor?

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: As a doctor.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Gun-shy-- it makes you gun-shy?

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.737 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Gun-shy
about giving bad news,

00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:38.858 align:middle line:84%
which puts people at
a real disadvantage

00:52:38.858 --> 00:52:41.025 align:middle line:84%
because they're functioning
without the information.

00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.470 align:middle line:90%
They go the opposite.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:45.513 align:middle line:90%
Can I give you an example?

00:52:45.513 --> 00:52:47.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, please.

00:52:47.195 --> 00:52:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And again, I
write about this in my book.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.080 align:middle line:90%
It was a young woman.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.740 align:middle line:84%
She was an IV drug user,
and she had endocarditis

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.990 align:middle line:84%
because bacteria was going
through her blood that

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:01.680 align:middle line:84%
had come in through her vein and
fastened onto her heart valve.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And she kept showering infection
all throughout her body.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.070 align:middle line:84%
She had pus in her brain
and all around her body.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It was terrible.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I hope it's not too--

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all right.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's graphic, but
it's important.

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: The fact is she was in
our ICU, completely in a coma,

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.430 align:middle line:90%
for months and months.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And her brain looked
terrible on the MRI.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.230 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't waking up.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And everyone really was
talking to her family about,

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.200 align:middle line:90%
this is terrible.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't think she's
going to wake up.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We think she's never going to.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And her mother said,
I believe in miracles.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Just keep doing this.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that she
ended up, shockingly,

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.510 align:middle line:84%
waking up about eight
months, nine months later--

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:42.242 align:middle line:84%
to everyone's shock,
completely unexpected.

00:53:42.242 --> 00:53:43.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happens.

00:53:43.075 --> 00:53:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It happens, but
rare-- rare, rare, rare.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very rare.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: And that case
impacted our hospital culture

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.180 align:middle line:84%
for years afterwards, made us,
oh, well, remember that patient

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.380 align:middle line:90%
in bed five in the ICU?

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:53.865 align:middle line:90%
She woke up.

00:53:53.865 --> 00:53:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could happen again.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: So any
time we'd say, well,

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.760 align:middle line:84%
let's try to tell this
family we don't think

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.927 align:middle line:90%
things are going to go well.

00:53:58.927 --> 00:54:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, remember that patient?

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is she was
such an outlier case,

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:90%
it was so unexpected--

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and actually,
infections, if you're

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.600 align:middle line:84%
going to have any type
of medical problem

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that could reverse, it
would be an infection.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But if she had had a big tumor,
or if she had had a big bleed--

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:90%
That's going to get her.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.132 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Probably, yeah.

00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is it impacted
our hospital culture for years.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to remember
that these are really, really

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:84%
outlier cases,
and they shouldn't

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.120 align:middle line:84%
make us not willing to give
bad news to other families.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever witnessed
anything angelic or anything

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:37.360 align:middle line:84%
really supernatural at the
moment of death or anything

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.180 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Yeah, well,
it's interesting.

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The most angelic
experiences I've seen--

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen lots of them--

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:49.460 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
families coming together

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and reconciliation and peace in
someone who hasn't had peace,

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.330 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a sense
of peace coming

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.870 align:middle line:84%
into the room over the day
or the week before a person

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.930 align:middle line:84%
died, family members
coming who hadn't

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:04.130 align:middle line:90%
talked to them for years.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:07.800 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's a sort of a
miraculous, beautiful thing

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.600 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the miracle
of human resilience,

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.900 align:middle line:84%
somebody who you just think
they couldn't take another piece

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:90%
of bad news-- they couldn't.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And they do, and they process
it in a way that's productive.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:23.968 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't say that I've seen
auras or things moving in ways

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:25.010 align:middle line:90%
that you wouldn't expect.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen
beautiful experiences

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:31.550 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't have expected,
psychologically and spiritually

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and socially, happen
that you weren't

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.810 align:middle line:90%
expecting that are beautiful.

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When a person dies,
doctor, the moment they die,

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.675 align:middle line:84%
is it the heart that just
stops that kills them?

00:55:43.675 --> 00:55:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: It depends.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:47.150 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways for a person to die.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But usually, the heart
is the final thing to go.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.720 align:middle line:84%
The breathing usually is the
second to last thing to go.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, the person maybe
will take one breath every 10

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.270 align:middle line:90%
seconds or every 20 seconds--

00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they in discomfort?

00:55:59.480 --> 00:55:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: No.

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times patients
are-- it depends, right?

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.810 align:middle line:84%
If we're involved as a
palliative care community,

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're on the case, and we're
really managing their symptoms,

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.595 align:middle line:84%
people can be very,
very, very peaceful.

00:56:10.595 --> 00:56:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought
the best way to die

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:13.760 align:middle line:90%
is in your sleep.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I do, too.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're going
to die, the best way to die

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:90%
is in your sleep.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I would agree.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if there
is an afterlife--

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you that
question in a second--

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:90%
they'll know they're dead.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.940 align:middle line:84%
If there isn't,
who cares, right?

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right.

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.130 align:middle line:90%
I would have to agree with you.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I would look at a doctor
as more of a scientist who

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:41.270 align:middle line:84%
has a different perspective
on life and death.

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to guess
that your belief

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.390 align:middle line:84%
system of life after death is
probably still on the fence.

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I think, for me,
as with so many other pieces

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of understanding life and the
world around me, I feel humble.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I know.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel any confidence that
I know if there's an afterlife

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.300 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could be right.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.400 align:middle line:90%
You could be wrong, right?

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: I just think, yeah,
there's some things that

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.170 align:middle line:90%
are unknowable.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:11.312 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that
it's all beautiful,

00:57:11.312 --> 00:57:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
afterlife, and that it's

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.220 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful afterlife, and
that people live beautifully

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.120 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to do is make
life here on Earth as good

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.230 align:middle line:90%
as I can make it for everybody.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a doctor who walked
up to his patient and said,

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I've got some bad news for you.

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:33.780 align:middle line:90%
You've got two months to live.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's your bill.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And the guy looks at
the bill and goes,

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:38.730 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god, doc, two months?

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:42.053 align:middle line:84%
And I can't afford to
pay this right now.

00:57:42.053 --> 00:57:44.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you've got
eight more months to live.

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.435 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: [GASPS]

00:57:46.435 --> 00:57:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
doctor joke-story.

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.038 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right.

00:57:49.038 --> 00:57:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They love
it at conventions.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.122 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Right,
right, right, right.

00:57:52.122 --> 00:57:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's
some truth to that.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:58:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The medical community prolongs
life when maybe it shouldn't.

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Right.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, number one.

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.953 align:middle line:84%
And number two, we
don't know how much time

00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:06.870 align:middle line:90%
you have left to live.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.465 align:middle line:84%
That's the other lesson
to take out of that joke.

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:12.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know if it's two
months or if it's eight months

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:13.900 align:middle line:90%
or if it's three years.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So we can give you
information based

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.200 align:middle line:84%
on what our general
experience tells us.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.570 align:middle line:90%
But we don't actually know.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what we have to
do, again, it's about humility

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and saying, we think this is
how much time you have left.

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
it's in God's hands,

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.970 align:middle line:90%
or it's in the universe's hands.

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's just try to
make whatever time it

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is as good as it can be.

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mentioned God.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you a believer?

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I am.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.898 align:middle line:84%
But I also, again, I will admit
that I'm very humble about it.

00:58:44.898 --> 00:58:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not sure.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I don't really know.

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not sure.

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I don't really know.

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you walked through
a hospital today, Jessica,

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and saw all these patients
with tubes in their mouth,

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:55.650 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.450 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.175 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I do it every day.

00:58:58.175 --> 00:58:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
pull them out.

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Oh, no.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't want to because
some tubes help people.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I have saved many lives
with intensive care.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is this a judgment
decision by the doctor?

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.502 align:middle line:90%
Who makes the call?

00:59:11.502 --> 00:59:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: About
pulling a tube out?

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About
pulling the tube out--

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Hopefully,
the patient.

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --about
putting them in.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.053 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Hopefully the patient.

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, it's the patient's
informed decision.

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I had all
these tubes in me,

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.878 align:middle line:84%
and you come by, and
I went, take them out,

00:59:24.878 --> 00:59:25.920 align:middle line:90%
even though you thought--

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.830 align:middle line:84%
you thought-- it's
better if they're in me,

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:30.225 align:middle line:90%
would you take them out?

00:59:30.225 --> 00:59:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, first
of all, you probably

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:32.760 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to say
take them out to me.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a tube
in your mouth, you can't talk.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, let's say,
(MUMBLING) take them out.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: But don't forget--
yes, and that happens a lot.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But would you?

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I would.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.418 align:middle line:84%
But we would make
sure, and we would

00:59:43.418 --> 00:59:45.960 align:middle line:84%
have lots of conversations, and
we would bring the family in,

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and we would try
to get a consensus.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but it's
the patient's decision.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.285 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: It is the
patient's decision.

00:59:51.285 --> 00:59:54.330 align:middle line:10%
If a person has capacity,
has mental capacity,

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:57.630 align:middle line:10%
and they don't want you
to do something to them,

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.130 align:middle line:10%
or they want you
to remove something

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:02.160 align:middle line:10%
from them, that is their right.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.800 align:middle line:10%
We do not have a
right to override

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.140 align:middle line:10%
a patient's preferences.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wish most doctors
would think that way.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yeah, well.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.982 align:middle line:84%
I think it's ultimately
got to be about a person.

01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do people get
your book, "Extreme Measures"?

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Anywhere--
Amazon, my website.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is?

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: JessicaZitter.com

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.640 align:middle line:90%

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: Yes.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, good luck doing
what you're doing.

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:31.692 align:middle line:84%
And it is a tough row
to hoe to get up there.

01:00:31.692 --> 01:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZITTER: Well, thank you
for having me on your show.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very appreciative.

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I hope even
one patient, I think,

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
is saved by something like this.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.613 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: I hope so, too.

01:00:41.613 --> 01:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I really hope so, too.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes
a big difference.

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:45.540 align:middle line:10%
It's a fascinating
subject, something

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:51.350 align:middle line:10%
that, ultimately, all of us
will have to face at one time.

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:55.615 align:middle line:84%
And if we do, let's just make
sure that our dying process is

01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
as comfortable as possible.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZITTER: That's right.

01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:58.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm George
Noory, and thanks

01:00:58.552 --> 01:01:00.580 align:middle line:90%
