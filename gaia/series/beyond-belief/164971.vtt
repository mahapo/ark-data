00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:19.719 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:10%
What we're going to talk
with you about tonight

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
could scare you,
because you're going

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:10%
to hear about things that you
may not have heard about ever

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:10%
before, but there's hope.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a way out.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:90%
There's a light.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
My special guest is
a pre-eminent scholar

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and researcher.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jordan Maxwell.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.674 align:middle line:90%
Jordan, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JORDAN MAXWELL: Thank you very
much, George, for being with me

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and allowing me to
be here with you.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jordan,
give us an example

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of what you call
hidden knowledge.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The word human
being means, in law, a monster.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A monster?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: In the
law dictionary it

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:90%
says a human being is a monster.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Then you look up a monster.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And a monster is
an entity that--

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.327 align:middle line:84%
similar to a man, but does
not have the same standard--

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Characteristics--

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --in law.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.511 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and standards.

00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It doesn't have the
same standing in law as a man.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
a man and a human being.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'd rather be
called a man then, right?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, that's right.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Because as a man, you are
the ultimate authority

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Because when you were born,
only God had a deal with you.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But then later on,
government comes in,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
religion comes in,
commerce comes in.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
every agency in the world

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:90%
has got control--

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, with--

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --over you.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --government, how does
this hidden knowledge work?

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: Well, let me give
you an example in commerce.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:10%
For instance, did you
know that in commerce you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:10%
do not, in America, pay a bill?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:90%
You cannot pay a bill.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You can discharge a debt,
but you cannot pay a bill.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
And so we say, we have to
pay this bill or that bill.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't pay--

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a bill.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.743 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --a bill.

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:90%
You discharge a debt.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
you were a painter--

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I give you a
bill to pay off this thing.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.136 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --well, suppose you
were a building contractor,

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and I call you to
paint my bedroom.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And you come over and give
me a price, say, of $100

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to paint the bedroom.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's-- we're
talking commerce now.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
business, all right?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
When you're through with the
painting job, you come to me,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:90%
and what do you do?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:90%
You give me a bill.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And the bill is for $100, right?

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So I reach in my pocket,
and I pull out $100,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and I give it to
you, and I paid you.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:90%
No, I did not pay you.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I did not pay you anything.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
You gave me a bill for $100.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I gave you a $100 bill.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
If you give me a bill for
$20, I'll give you a $20 bill.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Get it?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.625 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I'm
discharging a debt,

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm giving you
back your debt.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:90%
You're charging me $100?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:90%
No, I'll charge you $100.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you a $100 bill.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.575 align:middle line:90%
Now, you owe me $100.

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's look at
hidden knowledge for a second

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and how that relates
to all of this.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Who planted it there, and why?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, brilliant minds.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant minds a long time ago.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The system that we
live under government--

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
our system in America is
directly on the Rome--

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.882 align:middle line:90%
it's a Roman government.

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:32.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still?

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Still.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And so in the history
books, we say things.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:90%
You'll read things like Caesar.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
When he would officiate
over his government,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
he would go, quote,
"up on the hill."

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was called Capitoline
Hill, or Capitol Hill.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.325 align:middle line:84%
And he would officiate over
his senate up on the hill.

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
all the records--

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
Washington, doesn't it?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --and so sounds
like Washington, DC.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is that hidden,
or is that right out there

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.825 align:middle line:90%
for everybody to see?

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.866 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, of course
it is, but nobody ever

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
thought about it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
history book says.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Caesar went up on the hill.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But I don't see
anything sinister about that,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:10%
do you?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, it's
just a government.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's based on
Rome, and it's founded.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
And now, you begin to understand
the importance of the Vatican

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
in relation to America and
America being the new Rome.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And when Caesar was ruling
during the Roman Empire--

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.676 align:middle line:84%
when he went into Britannia,
or what we call the UK today,

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:84%
his base of operation
was called York, England.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.912 align:middle line:84%
That was the basis for
Rome's power in the UK.

00:04:42.912 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like the
movie the "Gladiator."

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.744 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Precisely.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And today in our country,
which is Rome, we now have--

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the basis for power is New
York, like York, England.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And so our New York is
the Empire State empire.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:90%
What empire?

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And so you begin to see there's
a lot of hidden words and terms

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that we consider to be
just normal terms that you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:90%
use on the street.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
No, you need to understand
when you go into a court,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
you better know what
you're talking about.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You better use the
right language.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
know it, get ahold

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%
of an attorney who knows it.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:10%
We've got a lot of
celestial objects

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:10%
that are tied into
religion as well.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yes.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, especially Saturn.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is very, very
important to world religions.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: All world religions.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It's very important.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Because Saturn
was the inhibitor,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and he was referred to
as the Lord of the Rings.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, Saturn
is Lord of the Rings.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lord of the Rings.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.695 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: They're still
making movies in Hollywood

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:90%
about "Lord of the Rings."

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And so today--

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the celestial
objects lead religion

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
into the direction that
it's gone into, or--

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --well--

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.016 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --vice versa?

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --I think that
somebody led us into this.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I believe-- it's
my personal opinion

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have extraterrestrial
or other world knowledge that's

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:90%
being given to us.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Nikola Tesla said that.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He said that all
of his inventions--

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
he would leave a pad
and pencil on his--

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:90%
by his bed at night.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning
would be an invention,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and so somebody was leading him.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody is leading
us, and telling us

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
about the gods and the
planets, and who they are,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and what they do.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And we call it astrology.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Where are we getting
this information from?

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is guiding our destiny.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know who it is,
but we're just following.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.635 align:middle line:84%
We just-- as people
do, they just follow.

00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're sheep.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: We're sheep.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And somebody is
guiding our destiny,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:90%
because we don't understand.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't do our homework.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know who
that somebody might be?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: Well, the
scriptures talk about--

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:10%
I have a video called
"Cosmocratorus,"

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:10%
or "Cosmocrat."

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's dealing with
this very subject

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of who these entities
are-- who are leading

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
the destiny of the whole world.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The Illuminati?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The
Illuminati, so to speak.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angels--
are they symbolic?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, I think angel
simply means messenger of God.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:90%
See, "el" in Hebrew is God.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And so angel is a messenger of
"el," or a messenger of God.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:90%
What God?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Who's God?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.905 align:middle line:84%
And now, you open
up a can of worms.

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another can.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Erich von Daniken
talks about angels.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.659 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Exactly.

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: We
have figures like angels.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
An angel in our normal knowledge
is a being, a messenger coming

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:90%
from God down from the sky.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We represent angels with wings,
with halos around their head.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But these angels
were not fine guys.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
These angels had sex
with some humans.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
These angels were not spirits.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:84%
These angels had war
among each other,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:90%
described in [INAUDIBLE] text.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So we must change the word angel
into the word extraterrestrial.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And an archangel is one
of the leaders of one

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
of the group of the
extraterrestrials.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
We must change
only about 10 words

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
in the old so-called
holy writings.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we change the
complete meaning.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And exactly this takes
now place in our time.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
extraterrestrial, Jordan?

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yes, they have to be.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.939 align:middle line:84%
You ask any child, do
you believe in God?

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:43.738 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:43.738 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Where is God?

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:90%
He's out there.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Up there.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.458 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well,
if he's out there,

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%
that means he's not from Ohio.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:90%
He's out there.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:90%
That's extraterrestrial.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, do you
believe in angels?

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.944 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are they?

00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:90%
They're out there with God.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
we headed as humans?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well, first of
all, we have no understanding

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
at all about religion
and theology.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You hear it-- talk
about Lucifer.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks
Lucifer is the devil.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, in the
Book of Revelation 22:16,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says, I,
Jesus, I am Lucifer.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say that.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
He said that.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:10%
It's in the Bible.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.953 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I got to look for that.

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, it's
in Revelation 22.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the last chapter in
the last book of the Bible.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is there hope
for mankind, Jordan,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:10%
in your opinion?

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Well, it's going--

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll see there's only going
to be a small-- people who

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
are awakening who want to know.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.619 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't want to know.

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
They're having too much fun
just being human, and going

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
to parties, and
kicking footballs,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and having fun,
whatever they're doing,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and running out the
material possessions.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants to know, until
it's time to leave this world.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you finally are
ready to leave this world,

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
now you're thinking
about, where am I going?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, now is a lousy time to
start thinking about that.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You should have thought
about that a long time ago

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and figured out who you
are, where you've come from.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
And now, where are you going?

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And why were you even
here to start with?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.136 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how do we create
a better world for people?

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I think,
first of all,

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to require the
whole human family, which

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.785 align:middle line:90%
sounds impossible.

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:84%
The whole human family
is going to have

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to take another look at
what is called humility.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
be humble enough to admit

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
you don't know everything.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should
understand religion,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:90%
understand government.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Where do courts come from?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have police?

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have the
world we have today?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.589 align:middle line:84%
It's because we don't understand
where things come from.

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why do you have police?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.296 align:middle line:84%
Or why do you have
to go to court?

00:10:56.296 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
You play basketball on a court.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:90%
You play tennis on a court.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you play
tennis on a court?

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:90%
You play with a racket.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
words and terms,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see how the system
that we live under is set up.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's been set up a long
time before your grandmother was

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
ever born.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you may not
like the way it's set up.

00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: That's too bad.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You came in the last five
minutes of the movie,

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know what the
whole story of the movie

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
was all about.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to sit
through the next show,

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and see how it came about,
and how you come to understand

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and believe what you do.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we make it better?

00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Can we--

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yes, we can--

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --fix this?

00:11:36.073 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --make it better
if we're humble enough to--

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
this is very important.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We can make it better
if we're humble enough

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to agree that we
don't know everything,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and that our religion isn't
the most important religion

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:90%
God is too big for one religion.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And when you understand that--

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about God,
like my one professor said,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.156 align:middle line:90%
you need to define your terms.

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
use the word God,

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that may not be what
I'm thinking about God.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
be humble enough

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to understand you
don't know everything.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You need to start researching,
and reading, and studying,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and go back if you
care to do that.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, most
people don't care to know.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they don't.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And so I have said so
many times, to change mankind,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, is like trying to
empty the Pacific with a cup,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because there's only a
handful of people who

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
really care and want to know.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.596 align:middle line:90%
But the masses of the Earth--

00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
they don't know anything about
it and couldn't care less.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
As long as they were eating,
and watching television,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.565 align:middle line:90%
and they're happy.

00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They're happy as long
as their belly is full.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
stepped on toes.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember when you
were on "Coast to Coast"

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
with me years ago,
the phone went blank.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You were gone.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you could still hear
people on the other end,

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
talking about maybe you'll
get the message now.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.124 align:middle line:84%
It's like they
clipped your line.

00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was scared
to death, because I

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what was happening.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't hang up.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to wait and
see what happened.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I could hear
some people walking around

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in an office.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was obviously
a very small office,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because I could hear the
reverberation of them

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
walking around talking.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, to set
the scene, Jordan,

00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
for what we're
talking about today,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
2004 came with the movie
"National Treasure"

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.282 align:middle line:90%
about government secrecies.

00:13:34.282 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the secret?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:10%
>> A treasure.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:10%
A treasure beyond all imagining.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:10%
A treasure that had been fought
over for centuries by tyrants,

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:10%
pharaohs, emperors, warlocks.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And every time it changed
hands, it grew larger.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.505 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly, it vanished.

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:10%
It didn't reappear for
more than a thousand years

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:10%
when knights from
the First Crusade

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:10%
discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:10%
You see, the knights who
found the vaults believed

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:10%
that the treasure was too
great for any one man, not even

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:10%
a king.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:10%
They brought the
treasure back to Europe

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and took the name,
the Knights Templar.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:10%
Over the next century, they
smuggled it out of Europe,

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:10%
and they formed a new
brotherhood called

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:10%
the Freemasons in honor of the
builders of the great temple.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:10%
War followed.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:10%
By the time of the
American Revolution,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:10%
the treasure had
been hidden again.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:10%
By then, the Masons
included George Washington,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:10%
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, look here, Ben.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:10%
The Freemasons among
our Founding Fathers

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:10%
left us clues like these--

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:10%
the unfinished pyramid,
the all-seeing eye,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.485 align:middle line:10%
symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

00:15:16.485 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:90%
They're speaking to us.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.622 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
That half-built pyramid
and that all-seeing eye?

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The all-seeing
eye represents the Messiah

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Testament.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the New Testament it
represents Jesus the Messiah.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And in point of
fact, the triangle

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
on top of a pyramid with the
eye is a symbol for the Messiah.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
In the movie,
"National Treasure,"

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the family was called
Carroll, C-A-R-R-O-L-L,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:90%
the Carroll family.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, my mother
used to tell me all the time.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
She would say, remember,
you're from the Carroll family.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.989 align:middle line:90%
That's your family.

00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:90%
She would say my family--

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:90%
On her side?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.541 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --on her side.

00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:84%
She said, my family
is the Carroll family

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:90%
and you remember that.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't you ever forget that
you are of the Carroll family

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and of the Washington,
DC Carroll.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And so she said that
to me so many times.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as a kid
that means nothing to me.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:10%
But it was not until
just a few years ago,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:10%
when I was reading the book
called "Rulers of Evil"

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:10%
by Tupper Saussy,
in which he was

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:10%
talking about the founding
of the United States.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And that the only
Catholic in this--

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:90%
I was born and raised Catholic.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, Tupper Saussy
said the only Catholic signing

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.206 align:middle line:84%
the Declaration of Independence
was a Carroll of the Carroll

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
family in Washington.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoa, you're
related to them.

00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:51.135 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: That was my
mother's family, the Carrolls.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And he
actually signed

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
on the Declaration
of Independence,

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and that was my mother's family.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think, Jordan, so much

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.183 align:middle line:84%
seems to be locked into
codes and mysteries?

00:17:03.183 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I think that
that's the way-- well,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:84%
the scripture says
in the Old Testament

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:84%
something to the effect that
it is the work of God to hide

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
in mysteries.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it is the glory of
a king to find him out.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is that God
does not make things easy.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just go sit
down, and have a quick drink,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and read the Bible,
and know all about it.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are all hidden?

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: All hidden.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the word for hidden
is occult, O-C-C-U-L-T.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Occult is not evil.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It does not imply bad, or
devil, or anything like that.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or paranormal.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, it
just means hidden.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you put your
hand in your pocket,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
dictionary definitions--
your hand's

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:90%
occult, because it's hidden.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, the
powers that be in this world

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:84%
do not figure that this is the
kind of knowledge, a hidden

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
knowledge as something
you need to know about.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
You just do what
you do and don't

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
worry about running the world.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.836 align:middle line:90%
They will run the world for you.

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
in the years I've

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
interviewed you picked up
some kind of concern or fear

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.792 align:middle line:84%
I just relayed the
story about what

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
happened when you
were on the show,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:90%
and your phone line got clipped.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:90%
What are you concerned about?

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I am being
watched, and I've

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:30.547 align:middle line:84%
been told that by military
people, by government people.

00:18:30.547 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you
stories you would not

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
believe about people
that I know in government

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:90%
that are very high up.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I do mean very, very
high up who tell me,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
we're watching you.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
You need to watch what
you say in public.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And I've been told that.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
The one time that you and I
were on the stage together,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.801 align:middle line:90%
and I was late getting there--

00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I remember that.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --right?

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got there,
there was-- government agents

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
came in the back, and I
was sitting there with you.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him come in, and I
just knew he was government.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
He just looked it.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And then as we were finishing--
just before we were through,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
he walked up to the front
and stood in the corner.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Waiting.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Waiting.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, because I'm
coming off the stage this way,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and we were looking at him.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came off, walked
off the stage, I looked at him.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you,
yeah, come here.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And I knew, well, there it is.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you go talk to him?

00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, I did.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he want?

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It was a very,
very interesting conversation,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't say
anything to me at first.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:90%
He said nothing.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
He reached in his coat and pulls
out a long, oblong wallet--

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
heavy, heavy wallet
and hands it to me.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I opened it up, and there's two
very impressive-looking badges.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:03.064 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very legitimate
badges and then two IDs.

00:20:03.064 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
he's the real deal.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: He's the real deal.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.399 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
for a few moments.

00:20:07.399 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I studied it, because
I've never been

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:90%
this close to the real stuff.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at those
badges and the idea.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Then I closed it up, and
I handed it back to him.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, so talk to me.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
government sends me around

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.287 align:middle line:84%
to the big conferences to see
how much the people don't know.

00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't know?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: That's right.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.364 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he knows you know.

00:20:29.364 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And he
said, I was told

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to talk, and to
come and see you,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
listen to what
you say in public.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And then he began
telling me some things,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not at liberty
to talk about right now.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But he began telling me
some really strange stuff.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they want
to shut you up, Jordan?

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I don't think
they want to shut me up.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Because he said to
me, your government

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
is not going to be your enemy.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:90%
We know who you are.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.074 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe that?

00:21:00.074 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I think so.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your
government is not

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
going to be the one to harm you.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:90%
There are others who are--

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
looking to, but it won't be us.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It won't be government.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
we appreciate

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:90%
what you're trying to do.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
You're just a teacher and
trying to educate people.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
And so we know.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
We understand that.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't see you as a
threat, but others do.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you need
to be careful what

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
you say in public, because
you're being watched,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're being followed,
and we know that.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about that
subject that is dear to a lot

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of people, but also
controversial--

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that of religion.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
You believe that there
are hidden meanings

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:90%
within religion.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, yes.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.626 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well, for
instance, as a Catholic,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I was taught as a child
like all Catholics--

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are
evil, and you die,

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and a sinner, and you died
that you will go to hell where

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:90%
your soul will burn forever.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, scaring the
living daylights out of one.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I was raised as a Catholic, too.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: So one day
at nine years old--

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Catholic school
at nine years old.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And the nuns told us,
now, tomorrow night

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
at the church service--

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
it's what we call
the confirmation.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:10%
And she said, now, tomorrow
night at confirmation service,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:10%
the bishop will be here.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:10%
And after the confirmation
service is over,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:10%
the bishop might
possibly-- maybe not,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:10%
but he might possibly ask if
you children have any questions,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:10%
and he'd like to
answer them for you.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And so remember if he says
that-- if he's asking you,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:90%
you do not have any questions.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:90%
You keep your mouth shut.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:90%
You have no questions.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
not easy for you.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --no, I came
in looking for trouble.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that night after
the service was over,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:84%
the bishop did say
to the children,

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
if you have any questions,
I'll try and answer them.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knew
you're not going to have

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
any questions, so I stood up.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I stood up to make sure
they know who I am.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, bishop,
I have a question.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, my father works
with torches like a welder.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if I had a
torch, and it was on fire,

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and an angel appeared
to me, could I

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
hurt him if I burned
the angel with a torch?

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why not?

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, something
to the effect that, well, fire

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:90%
is a natural thing.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to have paper,
or wood, or plastic,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:90%
or something to burn.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't burn an angel.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why not?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, first of all,
you can't even see an angel.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to burn.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a spirit.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.622 align:middle line:90%
And you can't burn a spirit.

00:23:40.622 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, then
why am I concerned

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
about going to hell where
my spirit will burn forever

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:90%
if you can't burn a spirit?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You set him up.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little Irish
priest standing very close.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, you--
yeah, sit down and shut up.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed around the church
everyone looked at me like

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:90%
a deer-in-the-headlights.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody--

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hush.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --ever
thought about that.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.414 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It's so simple.

00:24:07.414 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is simple.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And so
I-- at that point,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I begin to suspect that
the adults around me

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:90%
are playing the game.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.155 align:middle line:84%
They're just mouthing
and regurgitating.

00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:21.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some don't
know any better.

00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Some are just praying.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: They don't
know any better,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.014 align:middle line:84%
and they're just telling you
what their grandmother said,

00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
or what the priest said,
or what the rabbi said.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
They just--

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pass it on.

00:24:30.023 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --trusted
what they said.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot
of symbolism, Jordan,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
in the art in religion.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, very.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Only someone who rubbed
shoulders with the poorest

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:10%
people in Rome could produce
a painting like this.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:10%
Christ grabs doubting
Thomas's wrist,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:10%
guiding his finger deep into his
wound, burying it in his body

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:10%
until Thomas believes.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.930 align:middle line:10%
Caravaggio says, you don't
just look at my pictures.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:10%
You don't just stare.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:10%
You feel them.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:10%
OK, we say.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:10%
OK, we feel it.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:10%
We believe.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:10%
We believe.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't do it
just for effect.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:10%
It's because no one
else painting in Rome

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:10%
takes the message
of Christianity

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:10%
more seriously than this sinner.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Christ says the wretched
of the Earth can be saved,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:10%
and they are what
Caravaggio gives us.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.945 align:middle line:10%
The gospel is happening
right here, right now.

00:25:34.945 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:10%
When people come into
church and see them,

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:10%
they are thunderstruck.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:10%
Their lives change.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:10%
Their eyes open.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Their hearts pound.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:10%
In the presence of sacred
drama so vivid, so physical,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:10%
they think they can
stretch out and touch them.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
The most hardened sinner,
the worst sneerer believes.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:10%
This was the painter the
church had been waiting for.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:10%
Here's St. Paul
flat on his back,

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:10%
his eyeballs scorched
yellow by the blinding light

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:10%
of revelation.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:10%
Next to him, St. Peter bears
his load of cowardly guilt,

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:10%
crucified upside
down, unworthy, he

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:10%
says, to be martyred
the same way as Christ.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.775 align:middle line:10%
No one could touch Caravaggio
for capturing the sheer weight

00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:10%
of the gospels.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:10%
His faith is carnal.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:10%
The bodies in his
masterpieces are

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:10%
trapped in flesh, even when
they're the Son of God.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:10%
But wasn't that the
point of the gospel?

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Christ's presence on Earth
not as a weightless angel,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:90%
but in the flesh of man.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That kind of
depict a lot, didn't it?

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.641 align:middle line:90%
Was there much code there?

00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, yes, yes.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I am of the opinion that
the whole of the New Testament

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:90%
story about Jesus--

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.355 align:middle line:84%
the whole of the New
Testament is a metaphor.

00:27:10.355 --> 00:27:11.155 align:middle line:90%
The entire--

00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:11.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:11.955 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --story is simply--

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
it is a symbolic
metaphor, telling you

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
truths that have always
been known by mankind

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's just being retold
to us in what we call the New

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Testament, and it's a metaphor.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand the
symbols that are talked about

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and understand the symbolism,
it all begins to make sense.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:84%
For the first time, you're
not seeing it as history.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing it
for what it is--

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:90%
an encoded story, a metaphor.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is everything coded?

00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Just about.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just about everything?

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.241 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I've talked
with so many rabbis.

00:27:49.241 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes, there
are many codes in the Bible

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:90%
we don't tell you about.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dan Brown--
the Bible code, right?

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.808 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, that's
right-- the Bible code,

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:90%
but that's just one.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I was told by rabbis that
there's at least seven codes

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.141 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Testament.

00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
Torah code, too--

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: With the Torah--

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --isn't there?

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --the Torah codes.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so a classic example
is when you're looking

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:90%
at the story of the Holy Ark.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:90%
"Indiana Jones and the--

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Ark
of the Covenant.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --Raiders
of the Lost Ark."

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the lost ark is supposedly
the lost ark of the Hebrews,

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:90%
the Jewish lost ark, correct?

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.288 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --a
Jewish story, right?

00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, why did Steven Spielberg
have Indiana Jones go

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.440 align:middle line:90%
to Tibet first--

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.416 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --when he
was looking for the ark?

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And then from
Tibet, where did he

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
go once he got what
he was looking for?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Where did he go to
find the lost ark?

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
In the Holy Land?

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Egypt.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And he found it in Egypt.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Because their whole story is
based on an Egyptian story.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Ark of the Contract.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, a contract can
be called a covenant.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the Hebrews call
it the Ark of the Covenant.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
No, it was originally called
the Ark of the Contract.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's an Egyptian
story, not Hebrew at all.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.321 align:middle line:84%
And it has its
beginnings in Tibet.

00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, Steven Spielberg-- there's
a lot of things that I say.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did he get
the information for all this?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well,
this is my point.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg
is a lot of things,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:90%
but stupid is not one of them.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:84%
He knew what this story
is really all about.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get
the understanding

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
of the lost ark of the Hebrews,
you've got to go to Tibet.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And from Tibet, you trace
the conceptual idea to Egypt.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing is an
Egyptian story directly

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:90%
from Egypt.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it happen?

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well,
I don't think so.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was a story
in Egypt, and it

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
was based on something
that goes back to Tibet.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there in either place.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.311 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, some say
the Ark of the Covenant

00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:49.572 align:middle line:90%
is in a church in Ethiopia.

00:29:49.572 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, well, that--

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --no.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Storm the church.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: All right.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain something to you.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, where
do we find out

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.741 align:middle line:90%
about the Ark of the Covenant?

00:29:58.741 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in the Bible.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's in the Bible.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Then if
it's in the Bible,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
what does the Bible say about
where the Ark of the Covenant

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It says-- it tells you
exactly where it is.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Revelation, it says

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
God took the Ark of the Covenant
to heaven, and it's in heaven.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not in Ethiopia.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It's in heaven.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what the scripture says.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe that?

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Well, I mean--

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is there
a code there, too?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.125 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --there's
a code there, too,

00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%
but the point being--

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:90%
it's not in Ethiopia.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to the
black Israelite stories,

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and the British-Israel stories,
and the Masonic Knights Templar

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
All of these are ancient
stories that have just--

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.175 align:middle line:84%
circulating that gets into
motion pictures and movies.

00:30:41.175 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I tend to agree
with you there, too,

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:10%
or they would have
gone to that church,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:10%
and they would have found it.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Of course.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even if it
was buried somewhere,

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:90%
they would have found it.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Right.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:10%
Keep in mind, too, when you
talk about motion pictures, what

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:10%
we call the Caucasian man, or
the white man, so to speak,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:10%
comes from Europe--

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:10%
Northern, Eastern, Western,
and Southern Europe.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.315 align:middle line:84%
So anything happens
in the North,

00:31:07.315 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
East, West, or South is news.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So in Europe before the Roman
Empire existed in that area--

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:84%
North, East, West,
and Southern Europe

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
was already an establishment
of civilization.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:90%
They were referred to as Druids.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And the Druidic culture--

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:90%
they were-- they always--

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.580 align:middle line:84%
their symbol for power
in the Druidic culture

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:84%
was a magic wand like Merlin the
Magician with the magic wand,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.430 align:middle line:84%
or the orchestra leader
with the magic wand.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And you play the tune
his way, not your way.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Magic wands were always made
out of the wood of a holly tree.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It's made out of Hollywood.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Get it?

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin
to say, oh, I see

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.570 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in Hollywood.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a Druidic magic, but
it's a legitimate magic.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not sleight of
hand like the magician.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.330 align:middle line:90%
There's something else going on.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the other world.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Other world entities are
guiding and directing

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:90%
the destiny of the human world.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know it,
because we're so ignorant,

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and ill-informed, and
self-centered that nothing

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.610 align:middle line:90%
would--

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.230 align:middle line:90%
we would never follow anything.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why are these
messages all hidden, Jordan?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people like you
decipher them, find them,

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:90%
but most people don't.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I know.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.029 align:middle line:90%
Most people are not interested.

00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they
don't see right--

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: They don't see it.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on their nose here.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I always
say, they're not interested.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So why do you look for something
if you're not interested?

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.200 align:middle line:90%
But you see, I've always--

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
even when I was a child had
other world experiences.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I grew up seeing things and
experiencing things other

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:90%
children didn't.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jordan, we are on
a roller coaster of life.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden from
his Gaia television

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:10%
show "Missing Links"
tends to agree.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: What's causing
these extremes in our world?

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Why are they
happening right now?

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's all about cycles--

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:90%
cycles of time.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Scientists now
recognize that we are

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:84%
living the rare
convergence of three

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.070 align:middle line:90%
massive cycles of change--

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
cycles of climate,
economic cycles, and cycles

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:90%
of human conflict.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more you know,
these are natural cycles,

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and they follow natural
rhythms that we can know,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
we can predict, and
we can calculate,

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and they appear on
a regular basis.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
today so different.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:84%
All three of these cycles are
appearing at the same time.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.904 align:middle line:10%
They're colliding right now, and
it's happening in our lifetime.

00:33:41.904 --> 00:33:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You shake your
head at all the things

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
on this planet today,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's so frustrating
for so many people.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It's so chaotic.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:90%
How do we fix it?

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:84%
How do we really look
for some solutions

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:90%
to some of these ills?

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe we never can.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I hope we can.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I kind
of hope we can, too.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But it looks pretty
bad, because you've

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
got seven and a half
billion people on the Earth.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And out of billions
of people, there's

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.110 align:middle line:90%
only a handful of people.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
There always has been
only just a handful

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
who really are scientific
in their minds,

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're open to everything--
open to research everything,

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand where
things have come from.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they going to
be the ones to fix this?

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well,
they're the ones

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to wake up
the world today like yourself.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, but
without people like you

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to give people like me
an opportunity to speak,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:84%
we are kind of a small
group, and we're trying

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:90%
to help the whole human family.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, there might
be some sort of--

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic event in
which God, so to speak,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
will do something to awaken
humanity to who we are,

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and where we've come from, and
what we're doing to our Earth,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing to each
other, man's inhumanity to man.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
However, I think we
have to do it ourself.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Well, I'm afraid so.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.183 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we're doing here.

00:35:15.183 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to educate
people who want to know.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very big point.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They want to know, because
most people don't care to know.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so as I said, until
you get to be at an age

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
where you're looking at
passing away from this world,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
then you start thinking
about what life

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.399 align:middle line:84%
is all about and your family,
what's going to happen to them,

00:35:39.399 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and where you come
from, and then you

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.380 align:middle line:90%
want to know the mysteries.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.650 align:middle line:90%
No, it's too late.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:84%
You should have
started a long time

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
ago taking life more serious.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And so I do the best I can.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And I travel all over
the world talking

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:90%
about theology and religion.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, once you get
into that subject of theology,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
it opens up a massive world of
knowledge you'd never heard of,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:07.582 align:middle line:84%
you've never seen, and
know nothing about.

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you find out where
these different religions have

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.040 align:middle line:84%
come from and how
they're connected

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
to government behind the scenes,
it's an extraordinary story.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a book
called "Thy Will Be Done."

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the subject of
how the oil companies financed

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
churches around the world
to send out missionaries.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So many of the
missionary movements

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
of the church around the world
are financed by oil companies.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To find
more oil, probably.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Or prepare the
people for the oil companies

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to come in.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:90%
You prepare them.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.227 align:middle line:90%
You get them depending--

00:36:43.227 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Acclimated.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:44.893 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --on you.

00:36:44.893 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you give
them little trinkets,

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and give them money,
and food, and whatever.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
ready to accept you.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, they're ready to
accept Western civilization,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
the way you live, your
banks, and your government,

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you've slowly,
surely moved in on

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and colonized through
money from oil companies.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying,
unless you are

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:84%
prepared to look
at the real truth

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and understand that you
don't have the whole truth--

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and as a matter of
fact, most people

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
have no-- even knowledge of
what the truth really is.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I want to ask you
a little bit about symbolism

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:10%
of ancient gods
and how that ties

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:10%
into what we're doing today.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in
that kind of genre?

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: Well, it's
really interesting,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:10%
because the planets originally--
going as far back into history

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:10%
as we have written records
of and know anything about--

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:10%
there were three basic cults.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
They turned into-- after
those three basic ones,

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
concepts and cults today.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But originally there was an
astral cult, which was Stellar.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
Stellar Cult, meaning

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
that those ancient
peoples read the stars.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:90%
We call it astrology.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.980 align:middle line:90%
They read the stars.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:84%
They wanted nothing to do
with the moon or the sun,

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:90%
just the stars.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a
Solar Cult. And they

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:84%
were worshippers of the sun,
only of the sun, nothing else.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:90%
And then there was a Lunar Cult.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.298 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just the moon.

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The
worship of the moon.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And Moses was a leader
of the Lunar Cult.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to see
how the Lunar Cult worked

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and what it taught,
then you begin

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to see that was the basis
for what we call Judaism.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:84%
However, if you look
at the Solar Cult,

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:84%
you will see that that
was the basis for what

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:90%
we call Christianity.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And so today we are
still worshipping

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
the same ancient concepts
and ideas in our mind.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The more we change, the
more we stay the same.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
worshipping the moon today.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:90%
We're still worshipping the sun.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
recommend for people today

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
with everything that's going
on, on this planet today?

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is very chaotic,
and people are concerned.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:90%
People are upset.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.650 align:middle line:84%
What do you recommend they do
to get through with all of this?

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well, let me give
you an example of something

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:90%
I say often in my lectures.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have a two-story building
and you're going to put a lot

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of weight on the second
floor, like printing presses,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
or storing cars, or something,
the smart thing to do

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:84%
for the illustration-- the
smart thing to do is to go

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
downstairs, get on a ladder
with the building inspector,

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:84%
go up and remove
the ceiling tiles,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and look at the floor that
you're going to build on--

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Make sure it holds--

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --and see
if it's going to--

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --up, right?

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --hold
that kind of weight.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're doing now is
standing under the foundation

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.876 align:middle line:90%
to get understanding.

00:39:49.876 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
word comes from.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
To stand under the foundation,
you now understand.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to understand
what's going on today,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
you need to go
beneath the surface.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't just look at
what's being taught

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and what is believed by
everyone, because it doesn't

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.897 align:middle line:90%
matter what everyone believes.

00:40:08.897 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What you
see and what happens

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.521 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:40:11.521 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: That's it
and what you know.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why the church
was always the enemy

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.100 align:middle line:90%
of what we called the Gnostics.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Because Gnostic in the
Greek word meant to know.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's not a believer,
but they know for sure.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
education and science comes

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:90%
into the picture of theology.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is another story.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Boy, when we get into
religion, there's theology.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And then once you understand
what the word theology means

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you find out what
the word church means--

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And what's sane.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And people use the
word Jesus Christ--

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.860 align:middle line:84%
have no idea in the world what
the word Christ really means,

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.630 align:middle line:90%
or where it came from.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.570 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary
stuff when you find out

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:90%
You say, whoa, I didn't know.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
Christ mean to you?

00:41:01.112 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, it doesn't
matter what it means to me.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
What does the word
actually mean?

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Christ comes from Christos
in Greek, which Pillsbury has

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:90%
a cooking oil called Crisco--

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:90%
well, not Crisco--

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Christo.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And so it's an oil.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the oil goes
back to Lord Krishna in India.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Lord Krishna, Lord Christo.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Krishna.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Or in Latin, Lord
Christ or Christ the Lord.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.306 align:middle line:90%
So Christ basically means oil.

00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're an
Antichrist, you're anti-oil.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.340 align:middle line:10%
And it sounds simple and silly,
but in actual point of fact,

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:10%
there is something to this.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:10%
Once you get to the
etymology of words

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:10%
and trace their concepts
back into the ancient world,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:10%
you will begin to see
that what you think

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:10%
you understand
about religion today

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:10%
has no basis in fact whatsoever.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:10%
It's just people
coming up with ideas.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And you as a child--

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:84%
you grew up in a
household with ideas.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Nobody said the ideas were
true, but you just understand.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you teach your
children the ideas,

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and everybody goes to church,
or synagogue, or wherever.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And everybody believes
something until one day.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:84%
There's now, today,
beginning to show

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.582 align:middle line:84%
that the religions of this
world are not telling the truth.

00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it all
about control, Jordan?

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It's
all about control--

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what--

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --mind control.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.204 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --I thought.

00:42:31.204 --> 00:42:32.565 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the program.

00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:34.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Thank
you for having me.

00:42:34.023 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are all
kinds of hinting things

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
in symbolism and codes.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
An expert like Jordan
Maxwell easily sees them.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people like me probably
don't, but keep looking.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Because hidden behind
just about everything that

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:10%
happens on this planet,
according to Jordan Maxwell,

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:10%
is a message that
affects all of us.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
