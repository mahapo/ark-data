00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Great program in store for you.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
George J. Haas is
with us, the founder

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:10%
and premier investigator of
the Mars research group known

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
as the Cydonia Institute.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing career
you have had, George.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE HAAS: Well, thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
involved with Mars?

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, long ago, I had
been very interested in Mars,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.862 align:middle line:10%
planets from grade
school and college.

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As kids, we
love Mars, don't we?

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Right, and I
was remembering when--

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I was the class of 1976,
bicentennial class.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.843 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we had the
Viking Lander that landed.

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to
land on July 4, but--

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the one that
took the picture of Cydonia,

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.413 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The Cydonia
area, right, the Viking.

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So from that time on, I was
very interested in the idea

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
of possibly finding life
or structures or something

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.918 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you never gave up.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Never gave up.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.918 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never gave up.

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Now one of our
probes that circled

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the planet taking thousands
of pictures was the Mariner 9.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Correct.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When did that happen?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The Mariner 9 was sent
up in, I think, May of 1971.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And it reached and started to
orbit Mars in that November.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God,
49-year-old technology.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, and the Mariner
9 took over 7,000 pictures

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And it also took pictures
of the two moons of Mars.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
This Mariner 9 has
since crashed, right?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It just, gravity pulls it in?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.267 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, it photographed
the planet for about a year.

00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And it took some of
the first pictures

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
showing evidence of water on
Mars, some of the geology.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
It took pictures of the Valles
Marineris, the Olympus mounds.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
So it was very instrumental in--

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
provided a lot of science.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these,
George, dramatic photos?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when scientists
first saw them,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
planetary scientists,
astronomers, did they go crazy?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Oh, they did because
they saw all this evidence of--

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
they thought Mars
was a dead planet.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But the Mariner
9 showed evidence

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that there was evidence
that in the past where water

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.363 align:middle line:90%
had formed some of the geology.

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that there
was water in the past.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so
significant about that?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, if there's
water, there's life.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's always
been the mystery.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And the hard nut to crack with
Mars, is, what type of life

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:90%
was there?

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:90%
How long was there life on Mars?

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And how green was the planet?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Was it just a short period of
being sustainable for life?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:90%
These are the questions we have.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're still trying
to figure these out.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're going
to get into some pictures

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that you've supplied us and
they're pretty astounding,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
which will explain a
little bit more about Mars.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.765 align:middle line:84%
But it does make the
mind wander, doesn't it?

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes, it does.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the early
Mariner 9 pictures,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.232 align:middle line:84%
the scientist Carl Sagan
noticed a three-sided pyramid

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which
was pretty exciting.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did that baffle him?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.365 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, he
was very confused

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
about seeing a three-sided
very geometric formation

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
on the planet Mars
when they thought

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:90%
this was just a dead planet.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And he actually brought
this to the attention

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of scientific community.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That doesn't
happen in nature, does it?

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, a three-sided
any type of geometric shape

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
doesn't normally
happen in nature.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
With mounds, usually,
they're erratic.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:90%
They're dome-shaped at times.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult to
find a four-sided

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:90%
or a three-sided pyramid.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And this image that
Sagan had looked at

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
was very sharp angles.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And the formation
was also featured

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in a science paper, yeah, that
was published in "Icarus."

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha, OK.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Not by
Sagan, but by a group

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of other scientists
that had noticed it.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I think his name was
Gibson, something like that.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.118 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: And that was in 1977.

00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
So it was a little later.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
publication "Icarus,"

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:10.762 align:middle line:84%
wasn't that the person
who flew too close?

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:12.095 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes, and that's a very--

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:12.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the sun.

00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --highbrow
science journal.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it is.

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So that's a
very prestigious journal

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:90%
to be published in.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
images of Mariner 9.

00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a
couple of these, George.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.255 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain to us
what we're looking at here.

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:10%
So what are we looking
at here, George?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.947 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, this is the
Mariner 9's orbiter that--

00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's just the one
that took all the pictures.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.405 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is the one
that took all the pictures.

00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:10%
It had an onboard camera
and took over 7,000 pictures

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:10%
of the planet Mars.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:10%
How big is that in relationship
to a man standing up?

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.347 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: It's probably
about the same size.

00:04:46.347 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: They're not very big.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.237 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No, not big at all.

00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:50.485 align:middle line:10%
And this, what site is this?

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This image is
showing the location

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called Sagan pyramid.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:10%
This is the area of Elysium
that he saw the pyramid in.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was he able to
notice this and nobody else

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:90%
did?

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Well--

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or did people see it?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't say
anything about it.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well,
there was thousands

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.273 align:middle line:90%
of pictures to go through.

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And he had access,
being a scientist,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to go through some of
these early pictures.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And just the symmetry of it,
I guess, jumped out at him.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I guess, other scientists
had seen the formation,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.537 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of geologists, they're
just looking at the geology.

00:05:25.537 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And they might see
that and think, oh,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that's an interesting
geological formation.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
looking for water.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did Sagan
say about the pyramid?

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: He thought it was
an exceptional geometric

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
formation.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's got these three
faces, very sharp.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it possibly
could be artificial.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And the formation is
about two miles wide.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge mega formation.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he wrote the
book "Contact," of course.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:10%
And he was a staunch believer
that there was life out there.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:10%
Didn't believe
that it visited us.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he was not a
believer in ET visitations.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
But he did believe it was there.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, he was very
cautious about his ideas

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
about how explaining how
such a formation could

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
get on the planet.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.443 align:middle line:84%
He said that it was
possible it could

00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
have been an
artificial structure,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
but he tried to give
explanations for wind erosion

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.042 align:middle line:84%
And I think last time
I was on the program,

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
the wind on Mars.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get any faster than,
like, 16, 17 miles an hour,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:90%
15 miles an hour.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
When they have storms,
it can get up to 60.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're really not going
to get that type of erosion

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
on hard surfaces to create
these nice, flat faces that we

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:90%
see on this pyramid.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's show folks
what this Sagan type

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:90%
pyramid looks like.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, this is
the original picture

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.412 align:middle line:10%
that Carl Sagan saw.

00:06:47.412 --> 00:06:49.245 align:middle line:10%
The second image here,
this is a comparison.

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's much better.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: On the left side is
the early 1972 Mariner 9 image.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the sharp
angles on that formation.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
NASA sent up the
Viking orbiter in 1976.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And in 1978, they took this
picture, the second picture.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:10%
But as you can see, it's very
blurry, the one on the right.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's a higher resolution
picture from the Viking,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:10%
but I think the camera was
way high above the surface.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:10%
So this is the last picture,
the only other picture

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:10%
that Carl Sagan had access to.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.892 align:middle line:90%
And he died in 1998.

00:07:27.892 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's it again?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is a themis, the
Mars Odyssey themis image,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:10%
which takes heat signatures.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a--

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.577 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of the same
structure, though, right?

00:07:39.577 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Of the same structure.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would it
take in nature, George,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:10%
to make that kind of
structure in nature?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, these formations,
geologists would say,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
would be caused by wind erosion,
coming in different directions.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It would have-- and of
course, the wind would--

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.123 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: The wind would affect
the structures next to it,

00:08:03.123 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:10%
so you'd see a uniform type of--

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:10%
now this image
they're showing now,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.037 align:middle line:10%
this is what I call
the shield star.

00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It looks like a parrot.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now if you look at
this, it's very symmetrical.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:10%
You have the two points.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:10%
It's a star shape.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.442 align:middle line:10%
I call it a star shield.

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have the drawing
on the other side there.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It's very symmetrical.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
nature could make

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.813 align:middle line:90%
something that is so geometric.

00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks like
your mustache up in the top

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
left there.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: You notice
the point at the top.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how does something
like this happen naturally?

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Naturally, exactly.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: If you had wind
going across the top,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.527 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how you'd have
that point sticking out there.

00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What about the bizarre
structure down at the bottom?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: That's just-- actually,
a larger picture of this,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:10%
you would see there's a
big crack in the surface.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.997 align:middle line:10%
There's been some type
of faulting, which hits

00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:56.205 align:middle line:10%
the corner of that structure.

00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It almost looks like a
parrot's head with an eyeball,

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:10%
doesn't it?

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.193 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: It looks that it
has a beak to it and--

00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Down at the bottom.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.068 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Oh, I see what
you're looking at.

00:09:06.068 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:10%
Yes, yes, kind of.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.825 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's something.

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:10%
Now generally, George, that
would have been how big?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: That's about,
I think, 6 miles long.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 6.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Now what are we looking at here?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.176 align:middle line:84%
Is this that-- no, this
is a four-sided one.

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is another
four-sided pyramid

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:10%
in the same area.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:10%
These are all right next
to Carl Sagan's pyramid.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:10%
This is a four-sided pyramid.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:10%
I call this the kite
because the one end,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.223 align:middle line:10%
the western end is
a little elongated.

00:09:31.223 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:10%
But you can see
the symmetry here.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:10%
This is the perfect symmetrical
geometric formation--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.742 align:middle line:10%
again, something that
doesn't happen in nature.

00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
in the same area.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to take
aerials of the pyramids of Giza

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, would
they look like this?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: They would look
very similar to this.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is
that, of course,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:10%
these are probably covered
with dirt and sand.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.437 align:middle line:10%
So we're just seeing--

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:55.812 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's
a good point.

00:09:55.812 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: We're seeing the--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.577 align:middle line:10%
if the pyramids in Egypt were
covered with dirt and sand--

00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It would have
that kind of texture to it.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: You see this type
of formation in Mexico

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because the Maya had a
tendency to bury pyramids.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So Teotihuacan, when
that was first discovered,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:90%
it was just covered with dirt.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now look
at this strange one.

00:10:15.223 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now this is what I
call the Star Shield Junior.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
first one we looked at,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
but this is a lot smaller.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.807 align:middle line:10%
This one, I think,
is, like, 4 miles.

00:10:22.807 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now that
looks natural to me.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:10%
This one does.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, to me, it
looks very geometric.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.933 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the
drawing, all the angles,

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's just
amazing that you

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:10%
have all these angles in there.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:90%
And then here's this.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.927 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now this is,
again, next to all

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
of these other formations.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
This is another
three-sided pyramid,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the Sagan pyramid.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:10%
And this one has
the three faces.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Very geometric.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:10%
And again, this
is not a formation

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:10%
that you would find in nature.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the possibilities,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
George, that Mars was
inhabited and these

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:90%
were built by whatever?

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.795 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, that's what
we're thinking these are.

00:10:58.795 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
These are huge mounds, like
a mound building culture,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
like we have with the American
Indians out in the Midwest,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.273 align:middle line:90%
building these huge mounds.

00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:90%
These things are huge.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.712 align:middle line:84%
This is about two miles
square, this formation.

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened to them?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
If Mars was inhabited,
some catastrophe

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
destroyed them or what?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, that's what
we're trying to figure out

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
with what happened
to this culture,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
if these are actual structures
from a civilization.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, built
by a civilization.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It appears that Mars has
gone through many catastrophes.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
We had the third planet
theory, which the asteroid belt

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:84%
had blown up, that, possibly,
the asteroid belt was

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
a large planet that occupied--

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Between
Mars and Jupiter.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Exactly.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And that, through some type
of catastrophe, either natural

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of a Darth
Vader beam blowing it up,

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:90%
the planet blew up.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we have
the asteroid belt.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Now remnants from that
asteroid hit Mars, our moon.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
craters on that side.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It hit Earth.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The theories are that's
what killed the dinosaurs.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing with
the dinosaurs is

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that I think what
killed the dinosaurs is

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.758 align:middle line:90%
when this Planet X blew up--

00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I think so.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --creating
the asteroid belt.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and we
got hit by one of them.

00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It affected the
placement of the planets.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
The planets were--

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Earth was probably a
lot closer to the sun--

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --when this other--

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.730 align:middle line:84%
if you stick another
planet in there--

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not as close as Venus.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Everybody
has to move around.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in a line and
then another person's in line,

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
everybody has to move up
a little bit to make room.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Because everybody's got--

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got to
compensate for that.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: You have to have
your six feet distancing.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You've got to keep
your distance.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
planet is taken out.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Now everybody's--

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.598 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you've
got some more room.

00:12:38.598 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --jostling
for position again.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So, planet Earth
moves further out.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.790 align:middle line:90%
So now you have less gravity.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Or you have more gravity,
because it's the placement

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
of the planets are moving.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably what
killed the dinosaurs

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't live
through such a higher--

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
the higher gravity that we have.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at some
more formations on Mars

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and get your opinion on this,
whether these are terrestrial

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.800 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:90%
All right, this is--

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Now this--

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is perfect.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Right, this
image is found in Nevada.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:90%
This is on the famous Area 51.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
This is from--

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
natural structure?

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Google Earth, yes.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.705 align:middle line:10%
This was built-- this is a
military base in Area 51.

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The
symmetry is perfect.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.747 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah, but
I put this on here

00:13:28.747 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:10%
to show you how we're looking
at these pyramids on Mars that

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.425 align:middle line:10%
are very similar to this.

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a three-sided pyramid.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But this was not--

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
was this constructed by man?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it was?

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yeah.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: This is a man-made--

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:90%
this is on a base in Nevada.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is part
of a military base.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they're
using this three-sided--

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.102 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is that?

00:13:48.102 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --building for?

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:10%
This here is probably--

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Giza size?

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Oh, no, no, very small.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Small.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: It's--

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: There's actually
on the side of this a road.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:10%
Those little
buildings on the side,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.643 align:middle line:10%
that small one on the
right, that's probably

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:03.350 align:middle line:10%
as big as a tractor trailer.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's the
hole on top of it?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Don't know.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting take.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And again,
the top is flat,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
like you have the Giza
pyramids where the--

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
it's just perfect.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.407 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It's missing
the capstone.

00:14:13.407 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what
is this, George?

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: I put this slide in
there to show the viewers,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:10%
looking back at the star shields
and the star shield junior,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:10%
that kind of shape, this is
a very similar shape here.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:10%
This is Fort Henry.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:10%
This is in Tennessee.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:10%
This was built in 1861.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:10%
This was built
during the Civil War.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
In the 1700s, 1800s,
over in Europe,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot of military structures
were built as a star shape.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And during the Civil War, a
lot of the North and the South

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
utilized this whole
idea of star forts.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Because it has a military--

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --use.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that indeed
looks like a star.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And you have the
buttresses on the side, which

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
all this military use.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was just showing that
a common structural design

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
on Earth looks very similar
to what we're seeing

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.395 align:middle line:90%
on Mars with that star shield.

00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks almost
like a fort, doesn't it?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes, they're forts.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
That's Fort Henry.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Now what the heck is this?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Now this is an arkology.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:10%
This is the theory that some
of these structures on Mars,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:10%
like the Sagan pyramids
and these formations,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:10%
that these are huge
man-made structures that

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.642 align:middle line:10%
are arkologies that
you can live in.

00:15:19.642 --> 00:15:20.642 align:middle line:90%
So if we were to go to--

00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So this is underground?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.182 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And they also are
above ground and underground.

00:15:24.182 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see, OK.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So the
probability that if we

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
find these structures
on Mars and are

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
able to go there and
get inside, then we

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
may find rooms and libraries
and all kinds of things.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like a city?

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes, it's a whole city.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:10%
And what's holding it up?

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: It's just--

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It looks
like it has legs.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.445 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, that's elevators
on the sides that go down.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.403 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, all right.

00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is just a schematic
of showing you a profile view

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:10%
of what above and
below what these--

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now this
is based on your--

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: No, this is an
arkology which was put together

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:10%
by an architect.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
He was a student of
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.429 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: This is

00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:07.054 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
geodesic dome there.

00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is geodesic
dome, which was we all

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:10%
know Buckminster Fuller.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.925 align:middle line:10%
And him and Solaris
also worked together.

00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:18.725 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:16:18.725 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now you don't
find those on Mars, do you?

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: No, but we're saying
this type of intricate

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
construction could
be underneath these--

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Underneath
these facilities.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Which holding
these structures up.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This kind of composite
modular type of construction.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pyramids in
the star shape again.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is, again,
just showing you these

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:10%
could be the supportive
armatures of how

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:10%
these formations on
Mars are put together,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:10%
like the star fort and
things like that, if these

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:10%
were constructed on Mars.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And they're so
large, you would have

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:10%
to have these kind of girders
and arches to hold it up.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:10%
And this is just
contemporary people

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:10%
that have put these
theories together

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:10%
of trying to build
modern architecture.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we won't know,
George, unless we go, right?

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That's right.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
We have to go.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the thing.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And a lot of people at
this point want to go to Mars.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.996 align:middle line:84%
We have India working
on sending a--

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: China, everybody.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: China is teaming
up with their good friends,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%
the Russians.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
do a joint mission.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think Japan,
and also, we have

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.723 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk and our
government trying

00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:90%
to get to the moon and Mars.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeez, outside of
the Russians helping us

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
get to the International
Space Station,

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:31.125 align:middle line:84%
when's the last time they sent
a probe to another planet?

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:32.655 align:middle line:90%
My God, it's been years.

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:35.143 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, they're
teaming up with China.

00:17:35.143 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, China has been to
the moon twice already.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, absolutely.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And they've actually
been to the dark side already.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
on the far side.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: They're on
the far side, yeah.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what they're
doing over there, but.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But can you
imagine we got there

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:90%
with 50-year-old technology?

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It's amazing that--

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't
we capitalize on that?

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We were 50 years ahead
of everybody, George.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:90%
We'd be so far ahead right now.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Now they're catching up to us.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, I think the space
program was halted because

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.192 align:middle line:90%
of what they found on the moon.

00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:90%
I think there was more than--

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare them?

00:18:06.525 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: I think there was--

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the ruins and things that
we're finding on Mars,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
there was evidence through
the early Apollo photographs

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.917 align:middle line:84%
of the moon that there was some
weird things up there also.

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And that may be one of the
reasons why we stopped going.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were we told not to go?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: There's theories
that we were told, stay away.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The Russians were way
ahead of us in the '60s.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.697 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: They had orbited
the moon way before we did.

00:18:32.697 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They had the first
woman in space.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And they had the first float--

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
the first satellite.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.262 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Right, they
had the first low orbit

00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:90%
photographs of the surface.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
theories are that they

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
may have saw these structures
before we did and alerted

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
the United States and said,
maybe we don't need to go here.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.977 align:middle line:84%
We don't need this
kind of environment.

00:18:49.977 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be careful.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Right, and
then right after that,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy was assassinated.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true, too.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The raptor head,
the geoglyph, that

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is on Mars near the
Sagan pyramid, right?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yes, this
is the raptor head.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.945 align:middle line:10%
Now this is also located in
Elysium, which is about--

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: --350 miles
from the Sagan pyramids.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So to give the audience
an idea, that's

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
probably the distance from New
York to Richmond, Virginia.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's about 350 miles.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's very close in
the scheme of things.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at the
next picture, which I think

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:90%
is the raptor head as well.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.243 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yes, this is
just a colorized version.

00:19:30.243 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:10%
This is a raptor head.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:10%
It's a profiled head
of which looks to me

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:10%
has the beak, the small head.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:10%
It's got the eye.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just comparing it here
to a contemporary sculpture

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.032 align:middle line:10%
of a raptor head.

00:19:42.032 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
you think, George?

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
If these were made
by extraterrestrials,

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
what's the significance
of doing this?

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Why are they building structures
that resemble raptor heads?

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
So, for who?

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, if you look
at this complete complex,

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
the raptor head sits at
the top of the complex.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other
structures are below it.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.608 align:middle line:84%
The raptor or the eagle
is a symbol of the sun.

00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the highest point.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:10%
The raptor, the eagles, they're
the highest flying bird.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:10%
So there's Egyptian mythology.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You have Horace, all this
connections to the sun.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So it would make
perfect sense to put

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a pictograph of a bird, an eagle
at the top of your complex.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And a traveling culture
flying over your planet,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
looking down, seeing a
recognizable raptor head

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.567 align:middle line:90%
would say, oh, looky here.

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:90%
This is where our settlement is.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.413 align:middle line:90%
This is where our city is.

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is weird,
I got to tell you.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look natural.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now, this slide
here is showing you

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:10%
where labeled A, that's
where the Carl Sagan

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:10%
complex is with
all the pyramids,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:10%
the star-shaped formations.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Now if you go down to
the southwest letter B,

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:10%
that's how close the
raptor head complex is.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.075 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How far is A to B?

00:20:59.075 --> 00:20:59.471 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: It's 350 miles.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.217 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, not bad.

00:21:02.217 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
These structures-- and
they're all over the planet,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.685 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: They are.

00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it
shows you there's

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.362 align:middle line:90%
settlements all over the place.

00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:14.342 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Cydonia, which
most people know about

00:21:14.342 --> 00:21:15.142 align:middle line:90%
with the DNA--

00:21:15.142 --> 00:21:15.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The face.

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:17.886 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --pyramid and things
like that and the face on Mars.

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
early on were

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
just comfortable with
looking at Cydonia as--

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
because I know Richard Hoagland
had put a lot of emphasis

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:90%
on the mathematics.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And he figured that the Cydonia
area was the only place that

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.048 align:middle line:90%
had ruins and the face on Mars.

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's not true.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.382 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: No, but at the
time, he had thought that,

00:21:34.382 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
people did, too,

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that this was the
signature showing us

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
about all this high math and
the tetrahedral geometry.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And but what we're finding,
since a lot of people

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
got interested in looking
through these NASA photographs,

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.782 align:middle line:84%
is that we're finding
these similar complexes

00:21:49.782 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:90%
in other parts of the planet.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.198 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet.

00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: They're in
Utopia, in Elysium.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they near places
that you think had water?

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It appears
to be when you

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
look at NASA
scientists, geologists,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that talk about
where the water was

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and where the land
was, all of these

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
seem to be around
the shore area,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
right next to
where the water is.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not finding any
of these cities where

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
oceans where they predict

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
that the water would be.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So that even gives more
evidence that these are possibly

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
settlements.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Predict for
us what you think Mars

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:90%
was like a billion years ago.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, Mars
was probably very

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Earth like, rivers, oceans,
probably more water for mass

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
than we have on Earth.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And there possibly was
an advanced civilization.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Now these structures that
we're finding on Mars,

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
think that they

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
were built by the
indigenous people of Mars.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that culture
probably was extinct.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.412 align:middle line:90%
And when Mars evolved--

00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever
happened to Mars.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.245 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --and had
water, whatever

00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
happened to that
Planet X that blew up

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that created the asteroid belt,
that probably really affected

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.302 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Martian
people that were there

00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
could have known that this
thing was going to blow up

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.193 align:middle line:84%
and had moved and migrated
to Earth or our moon.

00:23:11.193 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We could
be the Martians.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: We could
be the Martians.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
on Mars is evidence

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of a more recent settlement.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the Martians left
Mars when it was destroyed,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:84%
came to our moon and our
planet, and once they

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:84%
evolved here and were
able to be spacefaring,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:90%
they put colonies on Mars.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And possibly, there
was another conflict

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
like we had with between the
United States and England.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.722 align:middle line:84%
You have colonies going from
Earth, settling on Mars,

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and of course, then they want
to have their own government.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Why are we depending
on Earth, we can--

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and that could end up having
a conflict and another war.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they
came here from Mars,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's ironic that Cairo
means Mars in Egypt, but let's

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
say they built the pyramids,
and they did other things

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, that's
another mystery.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with
the Martians, you

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
have this new settlements that
we're seeing evidence of now.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
is all dead now.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.333 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing on
Mars, this is ruins.

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody living there.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And you have to
add into that whole concept

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the Anunnaki,
what part did they play.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there seems to be a lot
of different candidates for who

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
built these structures.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, earlier,
one way we're going to find out

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:90%
is actually if we go there.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have to go.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.325 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And I think
there's a lot of evidence

00:24:39.325 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:84%
through the NASA photographs
and other European Space Agency

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that even England
and Germans that they

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:90%
want to be part of this.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And we all want to get
to Mars to find out

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
if any of this stuff
is actually something

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:90%
we can get our hands dirty on.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The surrounding area
of the raptor head geoglyph,

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
you sent us some
additional pictures.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at them,
George, and see what they are.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:10%
I find this fascinating.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:10%
Now what is this?

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now this is
a four-sided pyramid

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:10%
that has what
appears to be a ramp

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:10%
or a platform on the front.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:10%
You can see the four faces, very
geometric, very symmetrical.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:10%
You have the four
flat faces again.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:10%
At the top, there seems
to be a flat area,

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:10%
like there might have
been a capstone that

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:10%
had blown off at one time.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But this, again, is a very
symmetrical formation.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:90%
These lines that I put on--

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that I overlaid just shows
the spine, the supportive

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is something
that looks very artificial.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is,
it's very old, too, isn't it?

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yes, again, like
when the archaeologists first

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:10%
started looking at
structures in Mexico,

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:10%
a lot of them that were just--

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now this is strange.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, these
are covered in sand.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:10%
On the left side, we have
an S-shaped formation, which

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:10%
I call the serpentine mound.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Next to that, you have a
circular mound at the top

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:10%
and a square mound
at the bottom.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This whole formation, the
serpent S-shaped formation,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:90%
is about three miles.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:90%
So this whole thing is square.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And it all seems to
be clustered together.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't know
how anything could

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.635 align:middle line:10%
be explained about how
you could get a circular

00:26:13.635 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:10%
or square or this S-shaped
formation that would

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:10%
be caused by wind erosion.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could these have
been natural formations

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.553 align:middle line:90%
that they carved out?

00:26:22.553 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: No, I think these
are artificial structures.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yeah.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the get-go.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: And these two
examples here on the left,

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:10%
this is the cascade structure.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:10%
This was built-- this was plans
for an architectural house.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.275 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
cascade S on the left.

00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now where is that?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: And that is in Utah.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:10%
That was done by an architect
that did this in 2016,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:10%
I believe.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.291 align:middle line:84%
And his name was, I
think, Wallace Cunningham.

00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:50.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, and
what's on the right?

00:26:50.124 --> 00:26:51.332 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That's the architect.

00:26:51.332 --> 00:26:52.582 align:middle line:90%
On the right side, these are--

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:54.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like a
peanut. these modular--

00:26:54.582 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is kind of
like the geodesic domes,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:84%
but these are modular
formations that you can build

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:90%
any kind of shape with these.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is by I think a
Dutch architectural firm--

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
N55 it's called-- that
put these together.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And they call
these space plates.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:10%
And again--

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we looking
at it from above?

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that
what we're doing?

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:10%
So it forms an S just
like we're seeing

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:10%
like that serpentine
formation on Mars.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So either one of these
contemporary architects

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.292 align:middle line:84%
could have produced
that formation on Mars.

00:27:24.292 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now this is strange.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.156 align:middle line:10%
What is this?

00:27:27.156 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is an
American Indian mound.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:10%
This is just a circular dome,
which I use here to just show--

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You put some
comparisons in here.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.345 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Comparison
of the circular dome

00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing on Mars with
a huge American Indian dome.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:10%
Now that white
line you see there,

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.515 align:middle line:10%
that's a contemporary
piece that's been added.

00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:10%
That's stairs that you can go
to the top of the mountain.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And
obviously, you can tell

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:10%
this was man-made
because of the cemetery.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is, what, Mars?

00:27:53.442 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: No, this is on Earth.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
This is in China.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.165 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the--

00:27:58.165 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Man-made?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, these are one
of the man-made pyramids that

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:10%
are all in China.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:10%
These pyramids in China were
discovered during World War II.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why is it
so rough looking?

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Because
it's deteriorating.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a mound pyramid.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And what you're seeing--

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's old.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.395 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes, it's very old.

00:28:14.395 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And China hasn't really given
us much information about these.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.298 align:middle line:84%
These are in the
Zion area of China.

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they holding back?

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.132 align:middle line:84%
But this stuff was
always denied by China.

00:28:25.132 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't tell you anything.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you mean?

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:90%
They said it never existed?

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.002 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: They said
they never existed.

00:28:29.002 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:90%
But because we have Google--

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There is.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Google Earth--

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't hide that.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: These
things are all over.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%
There's hundreds of them.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And some of them are massive.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why
don't they come forward?

00:28:38.462 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's historical.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:90%
What are they hiding?

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it's a
communist government.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And if they say it doesn't
exist, it doesn't exist.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They've actually taken some
of these pyramids in China,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and they've put dirt over
them and planted trees.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:90%
So you can't see them.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So here, I'm showing the
comparison of the possibilities

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of you have this American Indian
mound, the circular mound,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the squared eroded
mound from China,

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.037 align:middle line:84%
and this contemporary
module type of construction.

00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:06.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there are
similarities between what

00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:90%
you see on Mars and here.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, I'm just showing
the possibility that these

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:90%
could have been constructed.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And these are--

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and I think what
you've done so brilliantly,

00:29:13.538 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
George, is you've
taken things that we

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
know are artificial from
here and compared it

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.547 align:middle line:90%
to things on Mars.

00:29:20.547 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:10%
All right, what do we have here?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now this is another
one of the formations that's

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:10%
below the raptor head.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That looks weathered,
extremely weathered.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: The top is rounded,
which could have been by wind.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:10%
But this is almost
a perfect pentagon.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.488 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating there, too.

00:29:38.488 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Right, and you
can see the line overlays.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.890 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty symmetrical.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:10%
This is another formation
down below the raptor head.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:51.060 align:middle line:10%
This is a square type mound
with a little truncated ramp

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:10%
that goes off the side.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And look at the
perfect circle in the middle.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.663 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now that's an odd thing.

00:29:55.663 --> 00:29:58.708 align:middle line:10%
The circle in the middle,
now if that was a meteor hit,

00:29:58.708 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:10%
it would blow up the structure.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The whole
thing would be gone.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, so
this appears to be

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:84%
some type of supportive
structure underneath that's

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:90%
collapsed.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can also
see the collapsing

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
on that linear part
there just below the--

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:84%
it looks like part
of it has collapsed.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What could it have
been used for if they used it?

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.715 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: These were
probably used for-- there

00:30:19.715 --> 00:30:21.590 align:middle line:84%
could be, like we were
talking about earlier,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:90%
these arkologies.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.300 align:middle line:84%
There could have been
massive rooms and structures.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it have
been a launch site?

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: No, I think it
was a building that--

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A building.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --people were living in.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A big building.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah, huge.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:10%
And you think that
they built these

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:10%
because of the environment?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They needed to hide?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: That's why I
use the arkology model

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're living
inside these huge mounds.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:84%
How do people get a hold of your
website and your work, George?

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I'm a member of the
Society for Planetary SETI

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Research.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:10%
They can contact me there, or
with the Cydonia Institute.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Just type it on the internet,
thecydoniaininstitute.com,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:10%
and--

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --we have all
kinds of records, archives.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of our papers
are published there.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And we've had, I
think, six papers

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.037 align:middle line:84%
published in science
journals that the audience--

00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
final graphics here.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
rectangular-looking formations.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: All right.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These got
to be fascinating.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.237 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, well, this
is a rectangular cluster.

00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's the
parrothead, right?

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.555 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Right, well the--

00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The raptor.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.628 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: The raptor
head at the top.

00:31:24.628 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:10%
And right below that, we
have this whole cluster

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:10%
of all these formations.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:10%
And on the right side,
that is a LiDAR image

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:10%
of a Maya city, which
is covered by jungle.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And the LiDAR camera
just comes down

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:90%
and bounces off the surface.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:90%
So this whole--

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They look
like buildings.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.898 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yeah, well, they are.

00:31:42.898 --> 00:31:44.830 align:middle line:84%
These are Maya structures
on the right side.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.245 align:middle line:84%
That's from Mesoamerica on
the right side of the screen.

00:31:47.245 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:84%
The left side, I'm just
doing the comparison,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
showing that this
whole cluster of--

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I see what
you're doing, OK.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --of formations
look very much

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:90%
like what we're seeing on Mars.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And this whole area
in that rectangle

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.392 align:middle line:84%
that's outlined there,
that's about 10 miles.

00:31:59.392 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.642 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Which is very comparable
to what we're seeing in Mexico.

00:32:03.642 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Maya did a little
better job than the Martians

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:90%
in terms of structures.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their objects are
a little more symmetried.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is, your
conclusion is what?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Mars was inhabited.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Something tragic happened.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:90%
They left, maybe came here?

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That about sums it up.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.157 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That does it.

00:32:27.157 --> 00:32:28.157 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
We're finding these
structures, but it

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
appears that these formations,
these large mounds,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
these pyramidal formations,
we believe they were built

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:90%
after Mars was a dead planet.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:37.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:37.993 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: A culture
that came there.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why these huge arkologies
are things they lived in,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.252 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to some
people think, well,

00:32:44.252 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
if you were to go to
Mars, the best thing to do

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.820 align:middle line:84%
would be live underground,
because there's water

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:90%
under there and everything.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But whatever culture
did this, they

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.430 align:middle line:84%
decided to build these huge
mounds in these big arkologies

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.230 align:middle line:90%
that they were--

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and once we go there
and actually are

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
able to go inside
those, we're probably

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.183 align:middle line:84%
going to find all kinds
of buildings and archives

00:33:03.183 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and libraries that are going
to be inside these buildings.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there
was a planetary design on Mars

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:90%
for the entire planet?

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: There are some people
that think that all of these

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:10%
cities and--

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're all connected.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: --complexes we're
finding are kind of connected.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.262 align:middle line:10%
I haven't seen the kind
of grid work that we see.

00:33:20.262 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a
lot of researchers

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that have done the global
grid that the Earth seems

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to have with all of
these cultures lining up,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.267 align:middle line:90%
these cities and everything.

00:33:27.267 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very obvious grid
pattern on our planet.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't seen strong
evidence of that on Mars yet.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't found
all the cities.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
you keep looking.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:90%
You keep looking.

It's fascinating, just to
think what that planet of Mars

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:10%
might have been like
millions, if not billions,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:10%
of years ago, and the
tragedy that occurred there

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:10%
when another planet exploded
and those Martians had to leave.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:90%
