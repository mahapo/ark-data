00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And we have an amazing
program for you today.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Jaime Maussan is a
Mexican journalist.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
He is an expert
investigating UFOs.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And he has been interviewed
on more media outlets

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
than just about
anybody I can remember.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
talking with Jaime today

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
about a number of
amazing UFO cases

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
plus some of the new things
he's been working on.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Jaime, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always good
to see you, my friend.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Thank you,
it's the same for me

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
started investigating

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.714 align:middle line:90%
all these very strange cases?

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well,
as you know, I've

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:90%
been a journalist all my life.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:10%
I worked in "60
Minutes" in Mexico.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
I became an
investigative journalist.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And in 1991 I
realized that we were

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:10%
in front of one of the
most important phenomenons

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:10%
of our time.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
People were recording
UFOs in Mexico City

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.594 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I asked people to record
more, to watch the skies.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And then I got involved.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And I received many, many
videos that I presented in TV.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And I got more.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
From there I started
to investigating cases

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.776 align:middle line:84%
on the field as I
do all the time.

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
that "oh my gosh"

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
feeling when you started
investigating these cases

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and you began to realize
there's something

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:90%
very strange going on?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
As you know when you are a
journalist, you need facts.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%
You need good evidence.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that the video recorded

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
by very normal people, we
are talking about times

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:90%
where CGI was almost unknown.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It was not available.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Then we saw this craft.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
wow, this is real.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
This is something I have
to really go in-depth.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.355 align:middle line:84%
And from that case, I went
to the other and the other.

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I always investigated
in the field.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately
now, most investigators

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.534 align:middle line:90%
just work in the internet.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't go to the places.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't go out
onto the field.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.089 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They don't go
and talk to the people.

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't got the feeling
and get the evidence

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
to prove if something's
right or it's not.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.854 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you do.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what I do.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.946 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what I do.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are so
many cases worldwide.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
We could go on for
18 "Beyond Belief"

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:90%
shows to talk about every case.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have focused
recently on cases in Italy.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amicizia.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --a case that
is at least 40 years old.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.547 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
look at a video on this.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It's something
I learned very recently.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I learned that in
2007 Stefano Breccia

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book in Italian.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Very recently, it was
translated into English.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:90%
It is called "Mass Contacts."

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And this man was a scientist.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:10%
He was director of the
University of L'Aquila,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:10%
"the eagle," in Italy.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important university,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
at least four
Nobels work there--

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --under his command.

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about one of
the most important scientists

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in artificial
intelligence in the world.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:10%
He decided to write
this book because he

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:10%
participated in
this experiment that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:10%
happened from 1956 to 1978.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:10%
At least 150 people
in Italy, and we're

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:10%
talking about
journalists, we are

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:10%
talking about
scientists, diplomats,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.459 align:middle line:10%
very, very important people--

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And just people.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --religious people.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All kinds of people.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: All kinds of people.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were in contact
with ETs, extraterrestrials,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
human-like.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
These extra terrestrials,
some of them

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
live in Pescara and Milan
in Italy and most of them

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
under the sea in a base
in the Adriatic Sea.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.265 align:middle line:90%
It sounds crazy.

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sounds strange.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It sounds
science fiction.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But I found at least
four witnesses, all

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:90%
of them more than 80 years old.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And they decided to speak to me.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And they provide me with
photographs and films

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:90%
from the '50s.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.400 align:middle line:90%
And we tested them.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
We asked some
analysts to really try

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:90%
to decide if they were real.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that they
were real, absolutely real.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to really
get interested in this case.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I found that all
these extra terrestrials were

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:90%
trying to help human beings.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And they went to different
countries like Russia.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
They went to Switzerland.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
They went to Austria,
Argentina, Chile.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Not to the US, not to Mexico.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
They went to France.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were in contact with
some people in every country.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The only case we have
been able to investigate

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:90%
is the one from Italy.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But we have enough
evidence to consider

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
that this case was real.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And something very important,
when these people left in 1978

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
in the 21st of June, 1978,
they destroyed their race

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:90%
under the sea.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
We had a tsunami, 90 feet
wave tsunami in both coasts--

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
good-size tsunami.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --in
Croatia and in Italy.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we think that
everything they said is real.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.764 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ETs were
living in Pescara.

00:05:56.764 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
mean by living there?

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They were
in contact with people.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amongst society?

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.967 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then they look like us?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%
They drove cars.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Some of them--

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They drove cars?

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.616 align:middle line:90%
They smoke cigarettes.

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd
they get licensed?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They did
things as humans.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.736 align:middle line:84%
No, because they were
involved in the human society.

00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:15.937 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Country of origin--

00:06:15.937 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Neptune or whatever.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's, well, that's
what the witnesses say.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.846 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when you
talk to these old people,

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
you get the feeling that
they are telling you

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:90%
the truth and so much detail.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know what, I was
going to ask you that, Jaime.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
When you look at somebody and
you look at them in the eyes,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.917 align:middle line:84%
can you tell if they're pulling
your leg or telling the truth?

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It was very
difficult for them to talk.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was very difficult.
They didn't want to.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But Bruno Sammaciccia,
the man who

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
was the leader of this
group died in 2003.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And he asked them
now to open the case.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the first one was
Stefano Breccia in 2007.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the world
learned about this case.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that
American investigators,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
field investigators got
interested in this case,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
go to Italy, and try
to convince themselves

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
how important this case was.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Amicizia" means
friendship in Italian.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> For some time now, Jaime
Maussan has been traveling

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to Italy to find and interview
the participants of what could

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
be the largest mass contact
program in the history

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
It was known as
"amicizia," which

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:90%
means "friendship" in Italian.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
For decades,
starting in the '50s,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
politicians,
university professors,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and citizens of Italy
were contacted by beings

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
from a different world.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
The ETs were on
earth on a mission

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity evolve to
their next spiritual level.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The many witnesses
and participants

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of the program filmed
flying craft, flew with ETs,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and even learned their language.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Jaime has been following
the case for many years.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
According to the
witness testimonies,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
other alien factions
that idolize science

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
attempted in numerous occasions
to bring the project down.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The conflict led to a plethora
of paranormal phenomenon

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.525 align:middle line:84%
in the Adriatic Sea and
over the Italian skies.

00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:21.579 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime,
these black and white

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.159 align:middle line:84%
photographs that we just saw and
video, I mean, what were they?

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well,
this is a craft that

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
made a demonstration to them.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:90%
There are many more pictures.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.790 align:middle line:90%
This is just a very few.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a highlight
of some of them.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, and there
are many more films,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:90%
all of them from the '60s.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It means that if
this is a hoax, it

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.085 align:middle line:84%
was planned 50, 60 years ago,
which doesn't make sense.

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were those
authentic pictures?

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have the negatives.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And the negatives
are from that time.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And besides
that, they were tested.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We know that they were
not over impositions.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.070 align:middle line:84%
There is no trick, that
they all just were large.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
different details

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that the analysts found to
declare this evidence real.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
We have all of these.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you
that in gaia.com you

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:10%
can find in the Spanish
site, this evidence,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:10%
this full investigation.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
so much to this.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important because it

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
seems that many years ago there
was a clear intent from them

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
to really get in touch with us.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But the experiment
failed because of humans.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
We fail as we usually do
because of interest, because

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
of money, because of how we are,
unfortunately, and they left.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But they said they
could come back.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And we think they did.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to speak you that
in the next part of the show.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime, with
these visitations,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
let's say specifically
in Italy, what do you

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:90%
think the ETs are looking for?

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to help us or
is there a different agenda?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: At least
the human-like,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:90%
they try to help us.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They said that love, for
them, was very important.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Love was like energy.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
how, but that's

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
what every one of the
interviews, the interviewers

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:90%
told me.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They said love was the
energy that they need

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:90%
to really to survive and work.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can believe them?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I believe them.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
as I said, it was

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to say, to
really believe that there

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:90%
were people living there.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Taking cars,
doing things like humans,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:90%
living like humans.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interacting,
everything, breathing our air.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: They like to drink.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They like to drink?

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: They like to drink.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's their
favorite little beverage?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.959 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: They like to smoke.

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
They told me that.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that that was also
real and part of the experiment

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long do they live?

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.002 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They live
for hundreds of years.

00:11:13.002 --> 00:11:13.801 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Even smoking?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: [LAUGHING]

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.591 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Someone's got to tell
them to stop smoking, right?

00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah,
well, I don't know.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
that experiment.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they did.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
involved Emilio

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
was able to decode their
messages, their language.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to understand
so much more from them

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
through their translations
from this language.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they say what star
cluster or planetary system

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
they were coming from?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, but they say
it was a planet very, very

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
similar to Earth.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said that originally
that planet was destroyed.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
to different planets.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.149 align:middle line:90%
And now they found the Earth.

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
For some reason
probably, they wanted

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to live here or
something because they

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
tried to adapt to how we were.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, they
couldn't stand us

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and they leave, unfortunately.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long or how
many of them, do you think,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.954 align:middle line:90%
came here at one time?

00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Hundreds of them.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds of them.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Hundreds of them.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.201 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a
number of craft, too?

00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Most of them, even
kids, living under the sea,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
living in a base.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:90%
This base was so high.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
It was like a mile,
the floor to the roof.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And it rains inside.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the base a
craft that basically sat

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the ocean?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No, no.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
They explained how they do it.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a full explanation,
scientific explanation

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
how can they really
make these holes

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:90%
without taking the dirt out.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.989 align:middle line:84%
They compress it,
they open it, and then

00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
somehow they are able to build.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's like a
bubble around it or a dome?

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like exactly like if
you make a balloon inside

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:90%
and you push it.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That's
how they did it.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a full explanation
of the craft, the materials,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:90%
the energy they use.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
There is so much.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't explain all of that
because I'm not a scientist

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and because it's a
very long explanation.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But the people who wants
to read about this,

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.720 align:middle line:84%
this book "Mass Contacts." they
can find it in the internet.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:90%
And they can read about this.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
worth it because it

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:90%
was a real experiment.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I believe after seeing
the evidence that this really

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
it's ongoing, Jaime?

00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I think it's
ongoing because I'm

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
going to present to you
the next case in your show

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:90%
that I think is related to this.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Now there is one
person recording

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:90%
these UFOs very close.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And they are real.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening in
Italy, too, in Milan.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so special
about Italy and these cases?

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Well, I don't know.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
As

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As opposed to
Mexico, Switzerland, Russia,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
it seems like Italy
has a lot lately.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, well, for some
reason, they like the people.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.824 align:middle line:90%
They like the place.

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:90%
I cannot tell you why.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they're
in to pasta, who knows?

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: [LAUGHING] Maybe.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, but it seems
that Italy has

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:90%
become very important for them.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And right now I think the most
important case in the world

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:90%
is happening right there.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying-- most cases
are happening now in Russia.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.395 align:middle line:90%
Russia is very important, too.

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But the most documented
case with the best evidence

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
right now is happening in
Italy where Antonio Urzi lives.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and tell us
a little bit about Antonio.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: Antonio
Urzi is a designer.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.867 align:middle line:10%
He designs clothes for
Lady Gaga, Rihanna--

00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A designer?

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --Beyonce,
Aguilera, Christina Aguilera.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Many, many very famous artists.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
He works for Versace.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
He works for Armani.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
He works for Chanel.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most important
designers in Italy,

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
he works for them.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He doesn't have the
big name as a designer yet.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't get the big
bucks from the business.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But he's probably one of
the most important artists.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Lady Gaga loves him.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He has done all his
clothes for the tours

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and for the Super Bowl.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he's a very,
very important man.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now how did
this guy a designer get

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:90%
involved in the study of UFOs.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well,
since he was a kid.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
He was a very young kid,
five or six years old,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and he started to tell
his mother and his father

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.125 align:middle line:90%
about these UFOs following him.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he started to look
to the sky every day.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes he told his father
and mother they are there.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes they saw it.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed them.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed his brother.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed his
father, his mother.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And they told me yeah, we didn't
believe him until we saw them.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:90%
And then he grew.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
He decided to start recording
them at the end of 2003.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:10%
In the year 2000, he got
close to Simona Sibilla.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And after they met
for some reason,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:10%
the sightings
increased even more.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
From 2002 to 2003 he
saw hundreds of UFOs

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.605 align:middle line:84%
until they decided
to record them.

00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was not thinking in
releasing all this information

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
or all the videos to anyone
until at the end of 2004, 2005,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
he decided to ask some
people like Giorgio

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Bongiovanni, stigmata,
who is my friend,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to analyze and to take
a look to his case.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
invited to go in 2006.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I saw
the videos from Antonio.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
they were fake.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they were so good
that they couldn't be true.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look at a
little bit of Antonio's work,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Jaime.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
>> This is some of the most
outstanding UFO footage

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of history, the
quality, consistency,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
and diversity of the identified
craft stands out from most

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:90%
other sightings.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the work of Antonio
Urzi, world-renowned UFO

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:90%
hunter.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:10%
For decades, he has been
filming otherworldly craft

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:10%
over the skies of Italy.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly,
most of his footage

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:10%
has been taken at the
epicenter of the activities

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:10%
of the Italian mass
contact case, "Amicizia"

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:10%
that took place during the
later half of the 20th century.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
For Urzi, it all
started at an early age

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
when he had his first
encounters with UFOs.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:10%
And now as an adult, no matter
where he goes in the world,

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:10%
he's able to film the most
clear and impressive flying

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:10%
saucers, luminous ships,
and extraordinary paranormal

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:10%
objects.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I just see
a horse flying around?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: [LAUGHING]
It's a horse.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a horse.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.535 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed every witness.

00:18:16.535 --> 00:18:19.984 align:middle line:84%
All of them saw how this
horse was moving the legs.

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A real horse?

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning I
was very impressed.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It was, I kept in my mind
that image, you know?

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I presented
in the Mexican TV.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And everybody, "ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a balloon,
Jaime, come on."

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And then I went back to Italy.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find a
balloon like a horse.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Then we had to ask internet to
send us a balloon like a horse.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
And they are this size.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, I took the balloon.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And you have the images.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And you will see how this
balloon goes upside down.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It goes straight to the sky.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't move like this horse.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: You know?

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was
under some control.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: But even
more important,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
after the witnesses they
told me that the horse was--

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
they recorded the horse
when it was going away,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
not when it was
really close to them.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't
have the camera.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Urzi came to see the horse
until he realized it was real.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
He went up, get his
camera, came back,

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:90%
but the horse was far away.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:84%
What is most
important, we found,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think nobody has,
three paintings with a flying

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:90%
horse in Italy.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:10%
One of them is at the Vatican.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You mean old paintings?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: Old
paintings from 1517.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:10%
This was painted at the
Museum of the Vatican

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:10%
in the chapel of
St. Peter Martyr.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, this man Pedro de Verona
who became St. Peter Martyr,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:90%
he was killed in 1252.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And we found after the
painting of the Vatican,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
we found two more
paintings, two in Florence.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And we realized
that this happened

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.707 align:middle line:84%
at the plaza of
the Santa Trinidad

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of Florence.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All with pictures
of a flying horse?

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And you can
see the people, the crowd,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
the flying horse.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That is why this
man was the declared

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:90%
a saint when he was killed.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Two years after
the sighting of the horse,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
he was declared a saint because
it was considered a miracle.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Now we don't believe in that.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So many years ago
it was a miracle.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Now it's laughable.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think this evidence
from one was painted in 1380.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
The other was painted in 1445.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.115 align:middle line:84%
And the third one in
the Vatican in 1577.

00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime,
what do you think

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the significance of a
flying horse might be?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
What's happening and
why is it happening?

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Just I think
it's a demonstration.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.812 align:middle line:84%
I think they're demonstrating
that they can do this.

00:21:00.812 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They levitate
the horse, do you think?

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They
levitate the horse.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:90%
They can do that.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They come to the house of
Antonio, just in front of him,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:90%
to his window.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's able to record
right there these UFOs.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.787 align:middle line:90%
You just saw two or three.

00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're remarkable.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: There are
50, 60 videos like that.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he like Billy
Meier of Switzerland--

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that has
those incredible--

00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.869 align:middle line:84%
Even more because
now it's closer.

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's in the middle of the city.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
There are many witnesses.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
There is a group now
that records with--

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
you saw the last two videos.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: There are other
videos recorded by other people

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So this is ongoing.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And what is incredible, I've
been with Urzi in Laughlin,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Nevada and he recorded a UFO.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:84%
In Chicago, he recorded
a UFO, in New York,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina, in
Brazil, in Mexico City,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey, in all of those
places where he was invited,

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:90%
he recorded UFOs.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling the
production people here,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I am telling you, invite Urzi.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Bring his videos.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And if he comes here
with enough time,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:90%
let's say three or four days--

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He will
record a UFO here.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Because they follow him.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.271 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They follow
him, don't they.

00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I
couldn't believe it.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that sometimes
he sleeping and these creatures

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:90%
come to his home.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I am very skeptical
about contactees.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I am skeptical
about, you know--

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until you
investigate them.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --ETs in
the houses and so on.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.999 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It's very difficult
for me to believe that.

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But he told me, Jaime,
it's very uncomfortable.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I wake up and I have a face
here in my face looking at me.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what to do.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have told
me in my head that I

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:84%
have to release all
this information.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
That they want us to
understand that they are here.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:90%
That they are good.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
That they don't want
problems with us.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:90%
They want to create a contact.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And he is the messenger.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's his
motivation for this?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.564 align:middle line:90%
Because, you know--

00:23:13.564 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He
doesn't get a penny.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't ask a penny.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, no money.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.801 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No money whatsoever.

00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
He's poor.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I told you he designs for
Rihanna, for Beyonce, and so

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: He doesn't get money.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.494 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's his career.

00:23:25.494 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That's his career,
but everybody exploits him.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The big names Armani,
Versace, exploits him.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, they pay him peanuts.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.512 align:middle line:90%
And he has to continue.

00:23:38.512 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes he
doesn't have money

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to get tapes or cards to record.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the way, he lives
in a very small house.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple life.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's so nice, you
couldn't believe it.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:90%
You have to meet him.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I think he's the most
important character right now.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:90%
He's not known in the USA.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: He's not known.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he will
be after this program.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Please.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Because he deserves to be known.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
He deserves good investigation.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
MUFON should get
involved in this.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Go to Italy.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Go to the witnesses.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Probably they will have the
luck to record you for--

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in June the 10th,
you saw the video,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:84%
a Japanese crew was
there recording.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And they got this video, too.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they
must have been amazed.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.894 align:middle line:90%
Does he speak English?

00:24:30.894 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, he
doesn't speak English.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He does not, all right.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He speaks
a little Spanish.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:90%
His mother is Argentinian.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And he speaks Italian.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, even if you have
to translate right in here,

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.855 align:middle line:84%
bring him because his
is very important.

00:24:46.855 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:90%
He's the Billy Meier.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe we could
have Paula Harris interpret

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Paula knows about him.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And many people know about
him, but not in the US.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I ask people here
and nobody knows him.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
most important case.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And he has so much to tell.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You will see what I mean.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you believe
that he gets these videos

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:90%
because they're coming to him.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.265 align:middle line:84%
For some reason
they want him to be

00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
able to tell the
world about them?

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely
I know they come.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You know something
very important?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important for
the people that records UFOs.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:90%
After 2011, he got a huge lens.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And now he-- at the beginning
the UFOs came to his house,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:10%
very close, very close.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Now that
he has a big lens,

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
they come very high in the sky.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
With these lenses, he's
able to record them.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can see what is a
little dot is a big UFO when

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:90%
you use that lens.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It means that if
people start recording

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
UFOs with super lenses,
we are going to see

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:90%
a very different reality.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, Jaime, has
he explained to you why him?

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
He's got to be
baffled about this.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I think this because
from very little kid

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:90%
he was so interested.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
He was looking to
the sky all the time.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
He was looking to them.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
He was-- he went to special
places to try to attract them.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes in
some of his videos

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:90%
you can hear music in his house.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Because he meditates.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And after he
meditates, they come.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.517 align:middle line:90%
And he feels it.

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
He feels the [GASP],, when
you go to the roller coaster.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] You have this feeling.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
He tells me it's
very uncomfortable.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.088 align:middle line:84%
Jaime, I am talking to you,
[GASP] and I feel this.

00:26:35.088 --> 00:26:35.888 align:middle line:90%
And I cannot talk.

00:26:35.888 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do anything.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he do
that in front of you?

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And he
knows they are there.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And he takes a camera,
he looks for them.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, he
records them right then.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he enjoy the
fact that he's being contacted?

00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I think he likes it.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He doesn't
like to be visit by them.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like that
because he gets scared.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
scare him still?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Now he has
cameras inside this room.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
sooner or later, he's

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
going to record these
creatures inside his house.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has he been abducted?

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He has not.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has he explained what
these creatures look like?

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, they are--

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:10%
some of them are human.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:10%
Many of them are greys.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are tall whites.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what he says.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they come to his
house, not the humans,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
but to his home,
the little greys

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and the other tall
whites, they come.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And he gets scared.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.709 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the tall
whites look somewhat human?

00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Somewhat human, yes.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're skinnier
though, aren't they?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes,
exactly, and very tall.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He told me they came
from here to here in his house,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in his house.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eight feet,
nine feet tall?

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Hm?

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.922 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How tall?

00:27:47.922 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Like what?

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:53.925 align:middle line:84%
Probably seven, six or seven
feet tall, very very tall.

00:27:53.925 --> 00:27:56.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're being
visited, in your opinion--

00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:57.258 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: He's being visited.

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --by a number of
different races and sects?

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.956 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: This
is the first time.

00:28:00.956 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I just went to see him in May.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
time he tells me

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that he has been visited.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:90%
He didn't tell me before.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
He said this happened
10 years ago.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's continue happening.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Not recently, but like for many
years it was very constant.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And now he has a camera
inside his house.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And he expects that
sooner or later, he's

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:90%
going to record them.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And people will believe him.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And some people like
Giorgio Bongiovanni,

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio Bongiovanni, the
stigmata, has told him twice.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Be ready--

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stigmata, of
course, being the wounds

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.887 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus, right, of Christ?

00:28:39.887 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: He said the
Virgin is going to give you

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:90%
a sign flying in the sky.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, amazing.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And Giorgio told him before.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:84%
This time in just
recently in April 2018,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
he told him you are
gonna record a gold UFO.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And he recorded this
gold UFO on April 17.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime,
are these messages?

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they trying
to tell us something?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the message is?

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They are using
him to tell us something.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They are using him for us to
get used to their presence.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
something important.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think very
soon we are going

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:90%
to learn why it's so important.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.707 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a warning
behind this message?

00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No, not really.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are we on
the verge of some calamity?

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, he
hasn't told me that.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would he?

00:29:32.525 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes,
I think he would.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
He would tell me, Jaime,
they are very scared.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.709 align:middle line:84%
Or they want us to
know that something

00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen to us.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
No, no, they just want us
to know, according to him,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
not to me, that they
want to be known.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.322 align:middle line:84%
They want us to accept
their presence here.

00:29:52.322 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well if that's
the case, though,

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:84%
why don't they land on
the White House lawn

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
or in the middle of New
York or something like that.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Because probably they want to
do it in a very smooth way.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:90%
They are using now--

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
would panic, I think.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Probably.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But after we accept
this case, for example,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:90%
we would be even more ready.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:90%
This is something else.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
in my life, I feel

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
like I am in front of a
real contactee, a messenger,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
a man who has been
chosen to do this.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The messages that
are out there that they

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:84%
may be leaving for us could
very well be coming come

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.410 align:middle line:90%
from crop formations as well.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's possible.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
that crop formations

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.145 align:middle line:90%
might be messages from ETs?

00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or I have always
thought that it had the "Gaia

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:84%
theory," that this
planet is alive

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's
communicating with us.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, I think
they come from the space.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I think they come
from intelligences.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's ridiculous that
some people say they do it

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I've been there 15 years
in a row in England.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've been there
after they appear.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I was in a field
the night before

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.517 align:middle line:84%
and the next
morning it is there.

00:31:15.517 --> 00:31:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's weird.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And they tell me did
it from 10:00, 11:00 at night

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.340 align:middle line:90%
to 4:00 in the morning.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And nobody saw them?

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Nobody saw them.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use any lights.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are so
complex, so perfect.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Why they don't record
themselves doing it?

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
You now have night
vision cameras,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you have drones
with [INAUDIBLE] cameras

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
that could prove that you
are doing something like that

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do it?

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I tell Linda Moulton
how, all the time, Jaime,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that if there are 10 crop
formations, how many, Linda, do

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you think, are real
or made by man?

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think
most of them are real.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, I
don't think they are.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe one is real.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And then she gets upset.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But I say, Linda, what
are you upset about?

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.944 align:middle line:84%
All you need is one that is made
by some extraterrestrial group.

00:32:06.944 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't need 10.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.384 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just need one.

00:32:10.384 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely,
I agree with you.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
think most of them are real.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy when
you educate your eye,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to see
when they are not real.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And
when they are real.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
see the difference?

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: The real
ones, they are perfect.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
There is not any fault, any
detail in a real formation

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:90%
that tells you--

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No mistake by man.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
some crop formations.

00:32:37.453 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Please.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> This star-shaped formation is
one of the latest crop circles

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:90%
of the year.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It appeared on July 7th in
Martinsell Hill in the UK.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Jaime Maussan has been
researching crop circles

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
for decades traveling
often to Europe

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to study the most
incredible figures.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:84%
This other one appeared one day
at Sutton Hall, also in the UK.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:06.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:84%
This other star-shaped crop
circle showed up overnight

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.155 align:middle line:90%
at Devil's Den in the UK.

00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
June has been a prolific
month for crop circles

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:84%
as it normally is, appearing all
over the UK and also in Italy.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there are messages
embedded in the circles which

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Jaime and his team have
been analyzing and decoding

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
in an attempt to extract
the information that's

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
within their sacred
geometric patterns.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, UFO
and paranormal phenomena

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
tend to accompany the appearance
of these stunning formations.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Is something or somebody trying
to communicate with humanity?

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.217 align:middle line:84%
If so, what are they
trying to tell us?

00:33:56.217 --> 00:34:00.359 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime, that's some of
the best video I've ever seen.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: These,
are from this year.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: All of them
are from this year.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
phenomenon continues.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.239 align:middle line:84%
The crop circle makers have
declared many, many times

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:90%
we're going to stop this year.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.353 align:middle line:90%
We're going to stop.

00:34:17.353 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We are not doing it anymore.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And they continue.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Who are doing them?

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Prove me that you
do it, you know?

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very easy to say--

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long would it
take a human or group of people

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.087 align:middle line:90%
to do what we saw there?

00:34:30.087 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: You
remember in California,

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
it was done, one very nice a
few years ago to make publicity.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They
did it in day time.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:90%
They did it.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:90%
It took them two weeks to do it.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.107 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two weeks in day time--

00:34:43.107 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, sir.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where people
could see them, right?

00:34:46.427 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, sir.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:84%
But in the United States
nobody is aware of that.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
Then you see people working in a
field, you don't pay attention.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
they're working.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.178 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: But in
England if you are

00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the night in a crop,

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
everybody will know that
you are doing something.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:02.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Why nobody--

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can't
do it in the dark.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: In so many years,
in almost 30 years or 35 years,

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:90%
nobody has been caught doing it.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.106 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Why nobody has been caught?

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not that good.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And the
farmers are really angry.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:90%
You saw the stars.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
their field, right?

00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes,
the star formation,

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:24.900 align:middle line:90%
the first one you saw.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is that?

00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It was destroyed
the same day by the farmer.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He just
mowed them down.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.891 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, because he
was very mad because people

00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:90%
would come to his field.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.431 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well that's
his wheat field.

00:35:35.431 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, you, and he
said, you know what he said?

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:84%
If they asked me, I
would give them one part

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:90%
of my land to do their thing.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Because I wouldn't
spend money on herbicides,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't spend
money on fertilizers.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:90%
And then do it.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you want.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And they don't ask me because
this is not done by humans,

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
message, Jaime, behind some

00:36:00.428 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:90%
of those symbols we saw?

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We know
some messages.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:84%
These messages are a
little cataclysmic.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
2002, you remember

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:90%
the face, the alien face?

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The face, right.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And you remember
the message in binary code?

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And they said
"much pain, but still time."

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:90%
They said that.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, there was a cross with
also a message in a bar code

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and it said, "beware."

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.422 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they
are trying to tell us

00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:90%
something is going to happen.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something is happening.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, at the end
of 2011 in Mexico,

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:84%
this didn't happen
in England, we

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:84%
have a formation
that you could see

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:90%
an asteroid coming to earth.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.469 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And this happened
12 or 14 months later.

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
we were gonna get hit.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: In February 2013,
OK, it happened in Chelyabinsk.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In Russia.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.116 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: In Russia.

00:37:09.116 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was a message.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1,400 people were
injured from the concussion--

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.915 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely

00:37:12.915 --> 00:37:14.081 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of the explosion.

00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And they told us
this was going to happen.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And through-- beginning
2011, December,

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.290 align:middle line:84%
we have so many
sightings in Chelyabinsk.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:30.370 align:middle line:84%
In December 22, 2011,
at least 20 people

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
recorded a UFO going
around the city.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.910 align:middle line:84%
20 people, 20 recordings
of the same object

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:90%
going around Chelyabinsk.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Through the whole
next year, 2012,

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.030 align:middle line:90%
there were many sightings.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:90%
I have many, many videos.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And then in February
we have the crash

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.042 align:middle line:84%
of the asteroid in
the very same place.

00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable timing.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't think
it's a coincidence.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, there
are no coincidences.

00:37:55.725 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: But we don't
want to look at them.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to believe
anything, you know?

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.334 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
get in touch with us

00:38:03.334 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:90%
through the crop formations.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.624 align:middle line:90%
They are trying to tell us.

00:38:05.624 --> 00:38:09.342 align:middle line:84%
They are giving us messages
and we don't want to listen.

00:38:09.342 --> 00:38:11.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is science
investigating these formations

00:38:11.425 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, no, they
declare these are fake.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.563 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to get involved.

00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:18.690 align:middle line:84%
They feel like if they do
it, they will be punished.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
They will be declared crazy.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't just want to do it.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Ask a scientist to
investigate the phenomenon

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see what I mean.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to get involved.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
That's very unfortunate
because the scientists,

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the first duty is
to investigate, not

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.575 align:middle line:84%
to declare something fake
without investigation.

00:38:39.575 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Investigate it first.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That's the-- but
they don't want to do it.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:90%
That's very unfortunate.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to do it.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:84%
All the scientific
investigations

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:84%
in the crop formations
have demonstrated

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that the crystals
inside the plants

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:84%
are in disarray after
a formation is done.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I told you about a ghost
formation that was there.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That was
the very last one.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a formation in the
very same place last year,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:84%
at the end of last year,
the very same formation.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And the energy remained
there and reappeared.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Now that the plants
are growing again,

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:90%
the formation is still there.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Explain to me that.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a ghost
formation from this year.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was there.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just the energy that
remained from the last year

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.470 align:middle line:90%
with the same formation.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It proves right there
that this is not human.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:90%
This is done by someone else.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it done by the same
ETs that we saw in "Amicizia."

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't
know, probably.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe?

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think we
are visited by hundreds

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:90%
of different civilizations.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if all of
them think the same.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.577 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if all
of them are positive.

00:39:51.577 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you
what I don't know.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.390 align:middle line:84%
What I know is that
the phenomenon is real.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not crazy.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm dedicating my
life to this because I

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.190 align:middle line:84%
believe this is the
most important thing

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.440 align:middle line:90%
for human beings right now.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We are part of a
group of planets,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of a confederation of
planets in the universe that

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
have intelligent life.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have to become adults,
not adolescents like we are.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:90%
We are abusing our planet.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
We are destroying our planet.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:90%
We are doing stupid things.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:84%
We now have to
grow and understand

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
intelligent beings.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:10%
In 1995 the first
exoplanet was discovered.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:10%
Now we know that there are--

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hundreds and thousands.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Hundreds
and dozens of--

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe millions.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --Earth-like planets
that could have life, you know?

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.200 align:middle line:84%
There are many even 10,
20 light years away.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:84%
There are, like
TRAPPIST, you know,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the seven planets in
the TRAPPIST system,

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:84%
39 year light years away,
all of them, all of them

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:90%
are like the Earth.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And at least three of them
are in the habitable zone.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It means that they could
be exactly like Earth.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if
in our solar system

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.386 align:middle line:84%
there was a second planet with
intelligent beings like us?

00:41:16.386 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it
would be amazing.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We would be very
different here, you know?

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes we would.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And I think we
have to understand and accept

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that and accept that we are just
one of the intelligent beings

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists have to
evolve to that, you know?

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You know about
the pentagon UFOs.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.110 align:middle line:90%
You know what happened there.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:10%
You know that they are accepting
people in the military, pilots,

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.670 align:middle line:10%
radar operators,
people in the Pentagon

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.790 align:middle line:10%
are accepting that they don't
know what is this phenomenon.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:90%
What are we waiting for?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
What are we so afraid
to accept all of this?

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to really, at least
there only, for me, it's

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:90%
the only way to save the Earth.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe if we don't do it,
if we don't have a big change,

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:84%
something bad is
going to happen to us.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's no
question, these formations

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:84%
are being developed
ETs, in your opinion,

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to give us a specific
targeted message?

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that message,
you think, is a warning

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:90%
most of the time?

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the message is
that we are not alone.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the main message.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And two times through
this year they

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:84%
gave us a specific message,
one in binary code.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.080 align:middle line:90%
There is no mistake there.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.710 align:middle line:90%
And the second in barcode.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:84%
It means-- and the third message
was in 2014 at the 6th of June,

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the anniversary of the
landing in Normandy.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:90%
It was no more wars.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:90%
No more wars.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the third
message we received.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It was said in Morse code.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Then we
know that it's not just

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.719 align:middle line:84%
to what we think about it,
it's a real, straight message.

00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because when
you look at the video

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:17.670 align:middle line:84%
we just saw of the crop
formations, it's pretty art.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it looks nice.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Are there any crop
formations out there

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that look so horrendous one
would look at them and go,

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, something horrible is
going to happen to this planet?

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't get that.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, I
haven't seen one.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen one.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:90%
All of them are sacred geometry.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
They are mathematics,
geometrical formations.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:46.372 align:middle line:84%
Then, no, think all of them are
very, very nice, very beauty.

00:43:46.372 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime, our
dear friend Erich von

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Daniken wrote a book years ago
called "Chariots of the Gods."

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.260 align:middle line:10%
And he highlighted the
Nazca Lines in Peru

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.340 align:middle line:10%
that he is convinced were
made by extraterrestrials

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.140 align:middle line:10%
and with humans as
messages for those above.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They could see things, spiders,
all kinds of symbols and stuff.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
You've been investigating this,
much more than just the lines.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you've been doing.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, I've been
investigating these bodies,

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
these dessicated bodies.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot consider them
mummies because they were not

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:90%
done mummies.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:84%
They were just put in a cave
with diatomaceous earth.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this
desiccates the body.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have been
investigating this.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are very, very
close now to have

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.040 align:middle line:90%
the final results of the DNA.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
going to prove that we

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:90%
found two different species.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:10%
One like human,
just very similar

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:10%
but not the same, and the second
like reptiles, which are--

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: ET types.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, ET types
like 15, 20 inches tall.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think in both
cases we're going

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.150 align:middle line:90%
to get the results we want.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The analysis has taken time,
more than I thought it would.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But they are done in
the best possible way.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:17.200 align:middle line:84%
50 layers, for
people, Investigators

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.530 align:middle line:84%
that know about this, it
means that it's very in-depth.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
the results very soon.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
here talking to you

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:90%
very soon about those results.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And I am very sure,
I could be wrong,

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
proof in my hands,

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:84%
but I think that
we're going to have

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:84%
a very good scientific evidence
to prove that in the past,

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
there were creatures that were
not humans living with humans.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I agree now with
Erich von Daniken,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.090 align:middle line:84%
these lines were
done by these hybrids

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:90%
that I think are hybrids.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And I will explain why now.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.884 align:middle line:84%
That lived with humans
and they did these lines

00:46:00.884 --> 00:46:02.050 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the sky.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To communicate
symbols to up above.

00:46:03.883 --> 00:46:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Why I think
they are hybrids?

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.310 align:middle line:84%
As you know, the Paracas
skulls were analyzed

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and now we know these
skulls have the foramen

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:25.840 align:middle line:84%
magnum, the hole in the the head
connected to the spine back,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.389 align:middle line:90%
it's like half an inch back.

00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More so than us?

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And that cannot be done.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
heads were real.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:84%
They were not elongated here
they were not made by humans.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.850 align:middle line:90%
They were that way.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same that we found
in Egypt, we found in Peru, we

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:90%
found in Mexico.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.274 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
born that way.

00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And they found
through the analysis of the DNA

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that the origin of these skulls
is the Middle East, probably

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:90%
the Sumerians.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.040 align:middle line:90%
You know the legends there.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Probably they came as hybrids
to really give knowledge

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In June of 2018,
Gaia released updates of Nazca

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:90%
with scientist William Brown.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM BROWN: I'm only
analyzing or interpreting

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.640 align:middle line:10%
the data as presented
in the report.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:10%
I would say that the beings from
which the samples were taken,

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:10%
from which the DNA
was analyzed, are not

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:34.780 align:middle line:10%
of any known terrestrial origin.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:10%
They don't appear to match
any species on Earth.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.770 align:middle line:10%
I first saw the Nazca mummies,
"most likely it's fake,"

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.450 align:middle line:10%
that was what I thought.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:10%
Although, that was my initial
reaction to seeing it,

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.640 align:middle line:10%
when I saw CT scans,
imaging of the bone

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.730 align:middle line:10%
underneath by
individuals who are

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.990 align:middle line:10%
trained in this kind of
practice, this kind of study.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So of the DNA that was
isolated, only 25% of the total

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:16.067 align:middle line:90%
matched any known human gene.

00:48:16.067 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in the beginning,
he thought they were fake.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.310 align:middle line:90%
He changed his mind, didn't he?

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Like many scientists, this is
going to happen to everyone.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't do
anything to the bodies.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They accused me in Peru that
I took the bodies to a shop.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I cut the fingers, I put
the fingers back into--

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.270 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:37.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
you do that, Jaime?

00:48:37.853 --> 00:48:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists,
the anthropologists.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But now let me tell you
something that just happened.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:84%
A congressman in Peru
asked to make a law

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to protect these bodies, to
investigate these bodies.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's ordering the
Ministry of Culture

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:90%
to investigate these bodies.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many are
there that we know of?

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We know, we have
an adult we call Maria.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a baby we
call Wawita, the baby.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And they are human-like.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have at least,
at least, probably even

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:21.030 align:middle line:84%
more, six types, six reptile
bodies 20 inches long.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Found in
a cave in Peru?

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Found
in a cave in Peru

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in a mine of diatomaceous earth.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.354 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they
died there or were put there?

00:49:31.354 --> 00:49:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, no, no,
they were buried there.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were buried there?

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:34.966 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:49:34.966 --> 00:49:36.870 align:middle line:90%
They were buried by the people.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember
that in the past

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the reptiles like Quetzalcoatl
were the ones that were sacred.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: These creatures
don't have ears, OK?

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Look at the head.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.750 align:middle line:90%
The body was stronger than us.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:90%
They have arms like a gorilla.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.630 align:middle line:90%
They were very strong.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:84%
They run very fast because of
the long, the feet so long.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:90%
They were able to run very fast.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It means that they were
considered very, very special.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And they have all
this knowledge.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They had to be sacred.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:90%
They had to be gods.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And they were treated like gods.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I think history
is going to change.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I think they were the ones that
are behind all these mysteries

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:29.880 align:middle line:84%
in Sacsayhuaman or Machu
Picchu or in Mexico or in Egypt

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:90%
or Tiahuanaco, Puma Punku.

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:84%
All of these are real
mysteries from the past.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think they are
related to these creatures.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And history is going to
have to change, George.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it's so
difficult to do anything

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.270 align:middle line:84%
about this because when we
have to change everything

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.779 align:middle line:84%
we believe, we don't
want to do that.

00:50:50.779 --> 00:50:51.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to happen.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And we will have to accept
that from the very past,

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:84%
we were in contact with
these civilizations,

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:90%
probably even more than today.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens next
in the investigation, Jaime?

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well, we have to wait
for the analysis of the DNA.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Once this is accepted, we have
to present probably a big press

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:14.940 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what Gaia
wants to do because Gaia

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.570 align:middle line:90%
is very much involved in this.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.994 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Without
the support of Gaia,

00:51:21.994 --> 00:51:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been
able to do this.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I am very, very
thankful to Gaia.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's an organization
that has come to this field

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to really help us,
to open our mind,

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.970 align:middle line:90%
our hearts to these phenomenon.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And after they
decide what to do,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I think this is going to be
news all around the world.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to publish
a scientific paper.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scientist.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But we will find
a scientists who

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.850 align:middle line:84%
writes a scientific paper with
all the analysis and results.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Once that is done, we have
to protect the bodies.

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:00.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to take them to
a university in Peru.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be
there for the future.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:07.640 align:middle line:84%
People all around the world
will be able to see these bodies

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and to decide for
themselves if they

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.870 align:middle line:84%
are real, the smoking going that
we've been looking for so long.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's right there.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It's physical.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.260 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I had a bad
experience three years ago

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:90%
when I presented a picture.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.837 align:middle line:84%
I still believe was
an ET in Mexico City.

00:52:25.837 --> 00:52:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, I remember that.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: And I was attacked.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't defend
myself because all I

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:32.550 align:middle line:90%
had was a picture.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot defend a picture.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.920 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to defend a picture.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.330 align:middle line:90%
But now we have the bodies.

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And we have the analysis.

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And we have everything.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And if these little
creatures are reptiles

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and they are intelligent,
it means that the ETs

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.820 align:middle line:90%
were here and are here.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And probably this is going
to be the biggest news ever.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And we are very, very close
to have this information,

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.340 align:middle line:90%
to release this information.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
We are weeks away to
this incredible news.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a time to be happy.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to celebrate
because something very important

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.480 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.687 align:middle line:84%
And if not, if not, we
will tell it to the world.

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:11.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a compromise.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One way or
another, one way or another.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, sir.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I am not a liar.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I won't lie.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, I am an investigator.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I am a human being.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.257 align:middle line:84%
I want to know the
truth like you are.

00:53:22.257 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then move on.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and to
build a better world.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
the bodies now, Jaime?

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Right now they
are somewhere in Cusco.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what I know,
somewhere in Cusco.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.144 align:middle line:90%
But they are ready to be moved.

00:53:37.144 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they protected?

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: They are protected.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:42.420 align:middle line:84%
They are ready to be
moved and delivered

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to the authorities in
Peru because that's

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.070 align:middle line:90%
where they belong.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.090 align:middle line:90%
But they have--

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they want them back?

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Is there some--

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They
haven't asked for them.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.884 align:middle line:90%
They haven't done anything.

00:53:52.884 --> 00:53:57.920 align:middle line:84%
They were told at
the beginning of 2017

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that these bodies existed, that
these things were happening.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.100 align:middle line:90%
And there was no answer.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.552 align:middle line:90%
So far has not been any answer.

00:54:06.552 --> 00:54:08.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the
Peruvian government?

00:54:08.135 --> 00:54:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the Ministry
of Culture of Peru,

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.660 align:middle line:90%
no answer whatsoever.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing?

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Nothing.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
strange all by itself.

00:54:15.533 --> 00:54:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, its because
all the archaeologists

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and anthropologists said
that this was a fake.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a debate in television
with an archaeologist.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And she said that if
these mummies were true,

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:84%
she would eat a cockroach
with mayonnaise.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could they say
it's fake until they're tested?

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what I said.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you say
what you have to say.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:38.939 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what I said.

00:54:38.939 --> 00:54:43.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what I tell you, all the
scientists are very prejudiced.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And they like to say even before
they know anything it's fake.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said,
please investigate.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling you
that they are real.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.134 align:middle line:84%
All I am asking
is to investigate.

00:54:56.134 --> 00:54:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And find out.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I ask all the people
who consider themselves

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:84%
investigators just in the
internet not to consider

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:90%
themselves investigators.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
consider investigator,

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.970 align:middle line:84%
go there, find out,
investigate yourself.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:12.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:16.370 align:middle line:84%
All the cases I presented
here, I've been there.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking to people.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.514 align:middle line:90%
I've done my homework.

00:55:19.514 --> 00:55:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime,
if it's determined

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that these creatures are
"out of this world," what

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:90%
does that tell us?

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.565 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That
we're in contact,

00:55:28.565 --> 00:55:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have an incredible
future, that our kids are not

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:38.570 align:middle line:84%
going to confront what looks
like an unavoidable future

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:90%
with catastrophes and so on.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.420 align:middle line:84%
It means that we could
get out of these problems

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and we could change and
create this paradise on Earth.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.150 align:middle line:90%
We have now the opportunity.

00:55:53.150 --> 00:56:00.470 align:middle line:84%
We have the evidence to support
that and to believe that.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
just about to happen.

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy.

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
for the near future.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we tell
by the creatures

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.260 align:middle line:90%
how they may have died?

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well, we think that
Maria died of tuberculosis.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They were half humans
and they were half ETs.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Subject to disease
and everything else.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, they
lived like humans.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:90%
They didn't live in craft.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:84%
They didn't leave
like all the luxury.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.230 align:middle line:90%
They lived like us.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And they confronted the
same sickness like us.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.190 align:middle line:84%
There is something
behind this phenomenon

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.680 align:middle line:90%
that it makes them closer to us.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.490 align:middle line:84%
As I told you in the
"Amicizia" case, they smoke.

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They drink.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.920 align:middle line:90%
They drove cars.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.030 align:middle line:90%
They live like us.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.710 align:middle line:90%
They like us.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They want to be like
us, too, in a good way.

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this is
their home now maybe.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Probably
it's been all the time.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The hybrids from Peru,
were they created with man

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and alien you think?

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:05.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.710 align:middle line:84%
We found in this first
analysis, as you heard,

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.530 align:middle line:90%
25% human, just 25%.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:16.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, it means that it's a part
of human, but 75% unknown,

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.930 align:middle line:90%
probably contaminated.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.460 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you
can contaminate 75%,

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.180 align:middle line:84%
probably 30%, 40%,
50% is contaminated.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But you know, a chimpanzee
is 99.99% percent human.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 99.9, there's
just one little strand.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: A fly is 95%.

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.090 align:middle line:90%
A mouse is 98%.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.166 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all close.

00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It's very close.

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:57:42.665 --> 00:57:44.680 align:middle line:84%
These species all
came from the same.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: From the same
origin, the same evolution.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:51.850 align:middle line:84%
You see, then it's
human, yeah, 25% human.

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:53.260 align:middle line:90%
What about the rest?

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to find
out in the very few weeks,

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.450 align:middle line:90%
in the very next time.

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's your
gut tell you, Jaime?

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I know you're waiting
for the results.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.175 align:middle line:90%
But is there something inside?

00:58:06.175 --> 00:58:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I know
they are gonna be ET.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I can be wrong.

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
I will be wrong.

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw it
with my own eyes.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're wrong,
do you continue to search?

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, there
is so much more.

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Once this is opened,
we have to go back

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:24.790 align:middle line:84%
to Peru we have to find out
more about the mysteries.

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:28.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to find, I am sure
there are more like those

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:29.980 align:middle line:90%
buried in Peru.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could be
all over the planet.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I think that there is
so much more to be discovered.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.948 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet.

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: You know, one
of your producers, Jay,

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:90%
he was with me there.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:40.390 align:middle line:90%
He was amazed like I was.

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were
like, what is this?

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.310 align:middle line:84%
He said from the beginning,
this is a hybrid.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, and he was amazed.

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:49.290 align:middle line:84%
"Jaime, this is
history," he told me.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And we were convinced and we
took scientists from Peru,

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:57.360 align:middle line:84%
from Mexico and from Russia and
all of them we were a group.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.120 align:middle line:90%
He can tell you all about it.

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.380 align:middle line:90%
We were so together.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.610 align:middle line:10%
We were so excited
because we knew

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:10%
we had found something
extraordinary.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love your
enthusiasm, Jaime, and thank you

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.030 align:middle line:90%
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:11.321 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No, it's a pleasure.

00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor for me to
be with you, George Noory.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
amazing topics.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:24.280 align:middle line:10%
UFOs in Italy, creatures found
in Peru, soon we'll get results

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.780 align:middle line:10%
and we'll let you know right
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:33.803 align:middle line:90%
