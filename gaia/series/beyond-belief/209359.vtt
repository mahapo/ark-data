Psychedelics today

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:84%
seems to be more
acceptable, Tom,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:90%
than it was back in the '60s.

>>TOM HATSIS: These
are actually medicines

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.790 align:middle line:90%
that can help society.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.382 align:middle line:84%
People have very deep
spiritual experiences,

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and I know because
I'm one of them.

LSD do to you?

>>HATSIS: It opens
up the gateways

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions
and other realities,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and enhances the senses we
don't normally have access to,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:90%
like more intuitive abilities.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not like getting
drunk and it's not

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
like doing some
other kind of drug.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
These are deep
insights and you're

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%

How in the world did you get
involved in all of this, Tom?

>>HATSIS: When I
was 18 years old,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:10%
I had my first experience
with mushrooms,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:10%
and it was love at first bite.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
you get the mushrooms?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: A group of people
in Fort Totten, New York.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know you're
eating the right mushrooms?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Because some mushrooms are
poisonous, aren't they?

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, the thing with
psilocybin mushrooms

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:10%
is that you pinch them
and they'll bruise blue,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:10%
and that's how you
have a good one.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you cook it?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:84%
How do you ingest a
mushroom like that?

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, I'm just--

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I just eat it like a sacrament.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Just straight--

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many does it
take to start putting you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:90%
in a different mode?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I
prefer higher doses.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So I like the 4-
or 5-gram range.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
seriously OD'd on this stuff?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Not really.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, other than having a
more enlightening experience

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:90%
if that can be called ODing.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Psychedelics
today seems

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
In the '60s, I mean,
you were the devil

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
if you were on
anything like that.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
Today it's a little
more accepted.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.968 align:middle line:90%
Why the change?

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, a lot of people
have been working really hard

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
over the past 20, 30 years to
show that these are actually

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
medicines that can help society
instead of scourges on society

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:90%

>>HATSIS: A
psychedelic historian

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
is someone who
looks into history

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and sees where and when
different people used

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
psychoactive and
psychedelic plants

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and fungi for different
kinds of purposes,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
whether they be spiritual,
therapeutic, religious,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:90%
mystical, things like that.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Santa a mushroom?

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: No, Santa
Claus was not a mushroom.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep hearing
stories that he was.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, yeah,
I've heard that, too.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
No, it's something
I actually believed

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in my youthful
indiscretion days myself.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But as I look deeper into it,
one of the important things

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
about psychedelic
history is not just

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
finding where psychedelics
appear in history,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
but also finding where they
don't appear in history.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And the whole Santa Claus
Amanita muscaria mushroom,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.653 align:middle line:90%
that's the famous red-top--

00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: --white
spotted mushroom.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --costume.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: What's that?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But his costume actually went
through a variety of changes

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout the 1800s, and only
later settled on red and white.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back
and look at the sources,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
if it actually had been
based on the mushroom,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that would have been evident
right from the start,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and it just wasn't.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, there's a
word, E-R-G-O-T, ergot.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.268 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Ergot is a fungus that
grows on diseased rye grain.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
It kind of sticks out
like a sore thumb.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It looks like this little
purplish black spur.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word "ergot"
comes from the French "argot"

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:90%
which means spur.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was the cause of
this horrific malady called

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
St. Anthony's fire all
throughout history where,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your limbs
blacken and fall off,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:90%
your skin gets all scabby.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it's horrible.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From this stuff?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We actually have reports
from the Middle Ages

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
suffering from ergotism,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:90%
which is what it's called.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually
drown themselves just

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.922 align:middle line:90%
to escape the torment.

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do some
people today still

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:90%
come down with this affliction?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I think
the last time this

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
happened was in the
early 1950s in France,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:90%
but not so much anymore.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We have much better
refining techniques

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
than the people of
the Middle Ages.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is
this ergot today?

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I mean, you could find
it anywhere where grain grows.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just a fungus that
will grow on grain.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's
that dangerous?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah,
very dangerous.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to eat
ergot, absolutely not.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.795 align:middle line:84%
And how does it tie into
the Salem Witch Trials?

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
so interestingly,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
just like the whole
Santa Claus and mushroom

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
idea that's kind
of a modern myth,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
another modern myth is the
idea that the Salem witch

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:90%
trials were based on ergotism.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But I went back and looked
at the primary records from

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the Salem witch trials
and it doesn't--

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --doesn't
even come up, does it?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.932 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No, it doesn't.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was
that the young girls

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
who had pretty much started the
whole Salem witch trials were--

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
it was said that they were
having these hallucinations

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and convulsions, and
there was a researcher

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s named Linda
Corporal who hypothesized,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, maybe this was due to ergot.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But the issue is-- why I think
that it wasn't actually based

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
on ergot was that the
young girls didn't

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
show any of the outward
signs of ergotism.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- their limbs didn't
fall off and they didn't get

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:90%
scabs or anything.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And they only seem
to have convulsions

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
when they were in the same
room with the accused,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%
like in the court house.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
That's mighty
specific for ergot.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know of any
kind of malady that acts up

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
just because someone
else is in a room,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.502 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as they're
led out of the room,

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:90%
the convulsions stopped?

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can pin the
origin of the Salem Witch

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Trials not to ergotism,
but to the imaginations

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.442 align:middle line:90%
of a group of young girls.

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, I want to
talk with you about LSD

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelics, but first
let's look at Paul Austin,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
an expert on
psychedelics, appearing

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia's "Healing Matrix."

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL AUSTIN: And
then when we look

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.188 align:middle line:10%
at the second wave
of psychedelics,

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:10%
this was when psychedelics
were first reintroduced

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:10%
into modern Western culture.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it started when Albert
Hofmann invented LSD in 1938,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and then really picked up
steam in the '50s and '60s

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
with Timothy Leary
and Richard Alpert

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and the entire counterculture.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And the hallmark of the '60s
as we know it culturally

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:90%
was irresponsible use.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words it was, well
everyone should just take LSD

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see how
that can transform.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And the big difference
between the second wave

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and the third wave
is the third wave

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is about responsible intentional
use for specific outcome.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And this has really
been kickstarted

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.327 align:middle line:84%
by the legalization
of cannabis where

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
reevaluate what we thought

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.493 align:middle line:84%
was a dangerous substance,
an illicit substance, and now

00:07:03.493 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
we're realizing, oh,
it has medical value,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and we can legalize it.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.878 align:middle line:84%
And then that was followed by
all of this research that's

00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
starting to come out about
the efficacy of psychedelics

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to treat a number of
intractable clinical conditions

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
like PTSD, treatment-resistant
depression, and alcoholism.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And so with those two forces
coming together, that--

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
plus this trend of
microdosing, it's

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
clear that our culture now
is more ready than it's ever

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:84%
been to finally have a
mature conversation about,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
how can we actually
use these substances

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
appropriately for development,
growth, and transformation?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, what
exactly is LSD?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: LSD is a refined
version of ergot which

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about
where the more awful parts

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
of ergotism are totally
suppressed and the--

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope so.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more, at
least in my opinion,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
the more spiritually significant
parts of it are amplified.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they make a
mistake and get too much ergot

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.723 align:middle line:90%
in the LSD?

00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
I'm not a chemist,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
so I would probably
make that mistake,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but other people that
know what they're doing

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.967 align:middle line:84%
are really good at making
sure that when you take LSD,

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:90%
your limbs don't fall off.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kids, don't
do this at home, right?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, do it in a park.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back again,
back in the '60s,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
LSD was used a lot
by the younger crowd,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:90%
but looked at as something evil.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Today it's a little more
acceptable, isn't it?

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Well again, there's
better research

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:90%
coming out as Paul said.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly,
before the '60s,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the 1950s was also filled
with responsible use.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of that that
happened before the 1960s.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Before LSD broke out
into the streets,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
it was actually
very well-respected,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and many doctors believed,
as many of us do today,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that this was a very
useful key into the mind

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and into the soul.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Albert Hofmann?

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Albert Hofmann
was the Swiss chemist who

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
synthesized LSD, as
Paul mentioned, in 1938.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
He was working--

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was number one.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, he
was the first one.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Actually, the date is coming up.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
April 16, 1938 was
when the first--

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
he accidentally ingested--
somehow, we don't know.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
He ingested a little
bit of LSD and ended up

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
leaving his laboratory
for the day.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And then-- this was on a--

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.187 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physically or mentally?

00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Mostly physically
and a little mentally.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
He said he just
felt a little dizzy.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And then two days later
on Monday, April 19,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
he took the first
deliberate dose of LSD.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't there a story
about the CIA giving somebody

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
LSD and the guy jumped out
the window or something?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
jumped or pushed.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:90%
His name was--

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or pushed.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: His name
was Frank Olson,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and he was part of an
experiment within this larger

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
umbrella known as
MKUltra where LSD

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
was given sometimes
wittingly, sometimes

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:90%
unwittingly to people.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And he seems to have
had a bad reaction.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, reports are
kind of a little fuzzy

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
because his wife said that
he had actually spoken her

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
on the phone and said
that he was fine,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and when he fell
from that window,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
it was actually the
Statler Hotel in New York,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
we don't know if he jumped
or if he was pushed.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But there really aren't
too many cases of people

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.625 align:middle line:84%
jumping out of windows a
week or so after taking LSD.

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this wasn't--

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --good point.

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%
This was way after the fact.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it-- personally I think he
was pushed, but that's just me.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are psychedelics
used as medicinals?

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh,
absolutely they are.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I use them
personally as medicinals.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And not just for--

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they do for you?

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well for me,
they put me in communion

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
with my goddess, personally.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a goddess worshipper.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your god is a goddess?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: My god
is a goddess, yes.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:90%
The creator of the universe.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And for me, they put me
in a communion with her.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I think
that they've been

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.233 align:middle line:84%
misunderstood throughout--
mostly because of the '60s.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, I agree with my
friend and colleague Paul

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't drive people crazy.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
With the right set
and setting, I mean,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.212 align:middle line:84%
people have very deep
spiritual experiences,

00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and I know because
I'm one of them.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know how much to ingest?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well for
me, I'll start off

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
with about 3 or 4 grams, and
then when I'm in that space,

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes my goddess will tell
me to take more, especially

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
with mushrooms.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll take more after that
and she'll tell me when to stop

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.613 align:middle line:84%
and when not to in order
to get to that place

00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
that I need to get to.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these considered
illegal substances still?

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, so in
Portland where I live,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
we just legalized psilocybin
mushrooms for therapeutic use

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and we decriminalized
all substances.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And-- I mean, this might
sound weird or arrogant,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
but I don't care about
the legal substance.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
These are-- we have a human
right to these medicines,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
so I don't care what
any law says about them.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would not put
cocaine in this category?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No I wouldn't.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Cocaine is a different--

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the FDA might,
but I certainly don't.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about the
dangers of fentanyl these days?

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, that's awful.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, people putting
fentanyl in things like MDMA,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:90%
that's just horrible.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So you always want to
make sure that you're

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
testing your substances
before taking them.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, people go to
Dance Safe and they'll

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:90%
send you a test kits.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.377 align:middle line:84%
And always make sure to test
your stuff before ingesting it.

00:12:37.377 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people don't put
fentanyl and mushrooms, really,

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
so you don't got to
worry about that.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
die from mushrooms?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you die from LSD?

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.075 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you can
die from fentanyl?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, there's
a big difference.

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
What does LSD do to you?

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
To the mind?

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It opens
up the portals,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
it opens up the gateways
to other dimensions

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and other realities.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least that's
what it does for me

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much all the witchy
people that I hang out with,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:90%
all the tree-huggers.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
For us, it puts us in communion
with nature and the gods.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
alert of things?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can function?

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah--
well, it depends, I

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.708 align:middle line:90%
mean, on how big the dose is.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you drive a car?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, absolutely not.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would not?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No, no, no.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
When I'm-- I mean,
when I do my--

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
when I eat my
psychedelics, I do it

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
in a highly
ritualized container.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's incense
and chanting and prayers.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
enhance your senses?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: In an odd way, yes.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it enhances
the senses we don't normally

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
have access to, like
more intuitive abilities.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people sometimes,
either with mushrooms or LSD,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.718 align:middle line:84%
will have these
psychic moments where

00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
they're like reading
each other's thoughts.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:90%
That happens quite frequently

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Between people?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And they actually tested
that in the 1950s.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman named
Rosalind Haywood who was a--

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
she was a medium, and she would
test both mescaline, which

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is the synthetic version
of the sacred peyote

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
cactus, along with LSD.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said that the
psychic state of awareness

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and the psychedelic
state of awareness

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:90%
were one and the same.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you overdose
on the psychedelics?

00:14:13.772 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I've
never heard of that.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.147 align:middle line:90%
I don't think you can.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, mushrooms are
one of the safest things

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:90%
you can put in your body.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you certainly can't
overdose on mushrooms.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they can't kill you?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Unless you do something
very irresponsible.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like jump out a window.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.367 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or be pushed.

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, or drive
a car or go swimming

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
or just-- it's better to
have a safe container.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you lose
control of your faculties?

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean,
do you say, I'm

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
going to go shopping
now in the car?

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Or do you know, are you
aware, I'm not going to drive?

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I mean, I can't speak
for how other people do it.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I personally think it's a very
bad idea to go driving a car

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
or go shopping or do
anything other than stay

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:90%
within a safe container.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But under the
influence, you know this?

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, of course.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you can't do this?

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this doesn't--

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
LSD and mushrooms, they're
not like alcohol or anything

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
like that or cocaine where
you get this, as they call it,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
like a liquid
confidence with alcohol.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty well aware.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, LSD doesn't destroy
the mind the way it was once

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
said it did.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of information
still floating around

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
out there about what
these medicines can do.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia's got
a program called

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelica discussing the
shadow side of psychedelics.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.765 align:middle line:84%
Let's get your
reaction after this.

00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>>BRIGTTE MARS:
There's a concern

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of young people
are taking these substances

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:10%
and maybe having a difficult
or dangerous experience.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I
think that when you're

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
doing these substances at
a concert with thousands

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of people and very loud music
that may not have the highest

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:84%
intentions, it might
be music that's

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
coming from a place of ego
and only junk food and alcohol

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
being served, I see
that as something that's

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:84%
going to not give you a
deep personal experience.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SHANE MAUSS: For me, I try
to avoid festivals and concerts

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:10%
in general when I'm
on psychedelics.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that I get a
lot of deep inner work done

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
when there's music blaring and
a light show and all of that.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It can be fun.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- it's not
that I never do it,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
but it can be a little
overwhelming for a lot

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:90%
of people, I think.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.263 align:middle line:90%
Or just not productive.

00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:10%
>>STANISLAV GROF: And
you have to choose

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:10%
if you want to use the full
potential of psychedelics

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:10%
or if you want to play
psychedelic roulette.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
People have taken it under a
lot of lousy circumstances,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
There are the raves
where people go get it,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what they are
taking how much they're taking.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They know they're doing
something illegal or the police

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:90%
can come-- this is the loudest--

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:84%
loudest possible
setting I can imagine.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So part of me
agrees because that's

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
what worked for me, is again, I
like to have a safe container.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a certain type
of mystical experience known

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
as a monastic mystical
experience, which is exactly

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that, where you are
surrounded by a lot of people

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of
music, and you lose yourself

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in that sort of environment and
the ego completely dissolves.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's not the way I
prefer to use these medicines,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't say that for
everybody that's the worst way.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
In my 20s, some friends and I,
we would go up to Lake George

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and we would make
this big bonfire

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and eat mushrooms and get
out the drums and guitars

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and dance around the bonfires.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it
was a lot of fun.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't recommend
anybody do that,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but it depends on
the person, really.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't do it that way anymore.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.458 align:middle line:84%
I would agree with a lot
of the commentary there.

00:17:57.458 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, interesting.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:90%
How often do you do it, Tom?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Mushrooms, that's the
one that I do the most often.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
At least once a year,
but a few times.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once a
year's not a lot.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No, it's not.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's integration
that has to follow.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is not
like getting drunk

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's not like doing
some other kind of drug.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
These are deep
insights and you're

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of
personal work, so you

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
want to have a period
of integration.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, psychedelics
are not magic bullets.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
They show you the path, but
you have to walk that path.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does LSD
give you the ability

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
to have extrasensory perception?

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Some people
would say that it does,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm certainly
open-minded to it.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that, again
in the 1950s--

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and a little in
the 1960s, they did

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:84%
test for that, and
unfortunately, the hammer

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.405 align:middle line:90%
came down, and people--

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
people weren't allowed

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to work with these
medicines anymore.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've had more than
enough experiences

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
with these medicines to say
that the case is definitely

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:90%
not closed on that.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it really is.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're tapping
into parts of your mind

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that you don't ordinarily
have access to.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, the mind
is a deep reservoir

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:84%
of just fantastic
cosmic awareness.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People at home
are watching this program

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're on the fence.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, I don't
know about LSD or mushrooms.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.605 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them?

00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: If you're on the
fence, don't take them.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you want
to be in a place

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
where you trust the
medicine-- as people

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
in my kinds of circles
say, to trust the medicine.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
When I take LSD or
mushrooms, I trust,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I know, especially
with mushrooms,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that these are gifts
from my goddess.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So I've never had
a bad-- like, I

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:90%
don't know what a bad trip is.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know what a bad
trip is, I've heard of them,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
but for me, I mean, that's
I've never experienced that.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have a bona fide
good supplier for mushrooms?

00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
get a bad supplier?

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I
pick them myself

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
from the Oregon Coast
with my partner.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know what you're doing?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.503 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, I
know what I'm doing.

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:10%
So I've grown them as
well, so I get them myself.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:10%
I learned-- I started doing this
because people would put them

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:10%
in plastic bags to sell them,
which is like, ew, you're

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:10%
suffocating them.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I want
to go get them myself.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So my partner and I,
we go to the coast,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:84%
we do all kinds
of witchy things,

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
we say prayer to the Earth,
we clean up the woods.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So if there's litter
anywhere, we clean it up.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then Gaia bestows
her gifts upon us.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
use of psychedelics,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:90%
what can you do with it?

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you use it as a tool?

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: For me, for
spiritual growth and just

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
a better understanding of
our place in the world.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
My own place, my community's
place, my friend's place,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and all of us and how we
can work better together

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And just to-- life is kind of
difficult, and it can really--

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:90%
it can knock you down.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And for me, just having
that space, a church

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
within your own body, a temple
within your own mind and soul,

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and being able to go
there, it just, for me,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
growing up in New York,
it certainly tempers me

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:90%
and makes me--

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It calms you down?

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what a lot of people

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
turn to these medicines
for, just answers, really.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of us are looking
for answers, especially as we

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:84%
get further and further
away from the natural world

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.880 align:middle line:84%
with technology and social
media that is ruining all of us

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
as people, having these kinds
of medicines and having that,

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:84%
as Terence McKenna would put it,
that archaic revival especially

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
within yourself,
being able to touch

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors through
these medicines I

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.723 align:middle line:90%
think is so important.

00:21:48.723 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you call
the psychedelics medicines?

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Because they are.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:90%
They've always been medicines.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
They've always been
spiritual tools.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to change that
paradigm that, again, grew out

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
of the late 1960s where
they were seen, again,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:90%
as the scourge of society.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And because you had a
lot of people using them

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
irresponsibly, they were taken
out of the safe containers

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and put into-- yeah,
going to rock festivals.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Again, for some people--

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's wrong
with that, though?

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well for some people,
they're not ready for that.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.292 align:middle line:84%
They'll think that it's
like, oh, well, you know,

00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten really drunk before.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I've taken half a bottle
of whiskey to the dome

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and I was fine.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I could go-- yeah, well,
mushrooms are way different.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're opening
yourself up to portals

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
beyond your normal
consciousness.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you really
want this loud amplifier

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:84%
blasting bass music in your
face when that's happening?

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it doesn't
enhance the music?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well it
can, of course,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
if you're spiritually
prepared for it

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're mentally
prepared for it.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, I like--
again, I would eat mushrooms

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and we'd have drums and
flutes and guitars and things.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
We'd throw love
parties in my house

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
where it's these very
decadent affairs with MDMA

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.537 align:middle line:84%
and mushrooms and fruit plates
and things and throw pillows.

00:23:05.537 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
papitate the heart

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
or give you a racy heartbeat
or anything like that?

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No, no.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Not if you're in that safe
container, it doesn't.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're dancing, of course,
at a concert it's going to--

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It'll
have that effect--

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
adrenaline is rushing--

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Your adrenaline is going, and of
course, it can cause confusion,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and especially if you're not
prepared for what might happen.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's not
always the best way

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:90%
to respect these mushrooms.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'll tell you where
they want the experience to go,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and if the mushrooms don't want
you to be at that rock concert,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:90%
they're going to let you know.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
have a misconception

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:90%
about the psychedelics?

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, that I don't know.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Nobody I hang out
with, but a lot of--

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet most people do.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.238 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, a
lot of people do.

00:23:51.238 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But as Paul had said before,
I mean, that is changing.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing more
and more that these

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:84%
are so beneficial for
the mind, body, and soul.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
Operation Midnight Climax?

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Wow, talk
about abusing LSD.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Operation Midnight Climax was
a subproject within the larger

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.003 align:middle line:90%
MKUltra umbrella--

00:24:12.003 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Part of
the CIA umbrella?

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, part
of the CIA umbrella.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It was run by a guy named
George Hunter White who

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
rented apartments in both
New York and San Francisco,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and he would
unwittingly drug people.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He would bring them back
to these apartments,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
slip them LSD, and then watch
from behind a double-glass

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
with a camera and he'd
be drinking whiskey

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and he would watch them
have sex with sex workers.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And he would drug
the sex workers, too.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was awful.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
An absolute abuse
of these medicines.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, because
the setting was so foul,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
the experiences were not good.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mentalist
Uri Geller talks

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
about many classified
CIA experiments

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:90%
that he was part of.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:10%
>>URI GELLER: Some missions--

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:10%
or most missions I
can't even talk about,

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:10%
because this wasn't--

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:10%
CIA wasn't the only
secret intelligence.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There was MI5, MI6,
the list goes on.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Now believe it or
not, they wanted

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to see if my mind can
trigger a nuclear weapon.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:10%
So they took me to the Lawrence
Livermore Radiation Labs

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:10%
where they build atomic bombs.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.375 align:middle line:10%
I can't even start describing
to you what happened in there.

00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:10%


00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:10%
This falls into
the category of--

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:10%
think about the most
incredible science fiction film

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:10%
that you've ever seen.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happened in that
secret installation of Lawrence

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Livermore Radiation Lab.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
That scientists
began to hallucinate.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:90%
They saw birds flying.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
People with no arms.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Washington was so concerned,
CIA were so concerned

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
about those scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore Radiation

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Labs that they flew people out.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
The things that were going
on at the Lawrence Livermore

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Radiation Labs when I tried
to trigger a nuclear bomb

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.215 align:middle line:90%
were amazing.

00:26:18.215 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know Uri
really well, and you

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
could tell that he was concerned
about that experiment he

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:90%
was part of.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure, yeah.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to be honest,
I'd never heard

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:90%
of that aspect of LSD history.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that
they were trying to use

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:90%
psychics to set off a bomb.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why would they do that?

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.483 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: They did a lot of
really nasty stuff testing--

00:26:42.483 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And strange things.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, really,
really strange, and again,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:90%
really awful things.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And trying to get a medium
to set off a nuclear missile,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if anything,
you should be

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
trying to get mediums to
disarm nuclear missiles.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
on Frank Olson?

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
Frank Olson, I mean,

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
it's a really sad case
what happened to him.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that he was actually
murdered by the CIA.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't even the first--

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they want to do him in?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Because this
was all top secret,

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
and they feared a stool pigeon.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't even
the first person

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to actually die under
these experiments.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.478 align:middle line:84%
So they were just
trying to keep it--

00:27:21.478 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought
he'd go public?

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.982 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, they
feared that he might.

00:27:24.982 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So out
the window he goes.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So out
the window he goes.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old was he?

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, I'm not 100% sure.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.017 align:middle line:84%
I think he was in his early to
mid-30s if I'm not mistaken.

00:27:37.017 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a young guy.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.558 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, he
was a young guy.

00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
War Without Death?

00:27:41.453 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So the
War Without Death

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
was largely the idea of a
named Major General William

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Creasy who thought
that we could--

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of like sending
troops into urban areas

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and having a firefight, what if
we could just somehow deliver

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:84%
LSD to troubled areas and
then round up insurgents?

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to actually
test this by bombing

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
an American subway,
which they didn't do.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:90%
They said, well--

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: False flags.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
exactly, it would

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:90%
be like a false flag thing.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: They didn't end up
doing that, but in theory,

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
it's really not a bad
idea, I mean, not--

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the death
and horrible parts of war.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Like if you could just put
people in an LSD trance

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But this, of course,
has its problems.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people will become
violently even more aggressive.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And also, they
learned, actually,

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:84%
during the Midnight
Climax tests,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot
detonate LSD in the air.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Like you couldn't have it as
an aerosol spray or anything

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: And also--

00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
work, it's not effective.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it's
not effective at all.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So then they said, well, what if
we put it in the water supply?

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK,
sure, but how do you

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:84%
ensure that only insurgents
are drinking that water?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going
to be drinking it.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And do you really want an
entire area, especially

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in area under control of
insurgents with everybody

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:90%
tripping on LSD?

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Probably not the best idea.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the most
bizarre aspect of all of this

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:90%
that you've gone through?

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Do get emotional?

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you cry?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh, many
times I've cried.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're tears of joy,
they're tears of ecstasy.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
tears of like just--

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not sadness.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Tears of just bliss and just
being in that divine place,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:90%
like it's that kind of tear.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Like someone is at a
wedding, people are crying,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're not sad,
it's tears of joy.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you'll
continue doing this?

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these are a deep and
meaningful part of my life.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's part of
my own spiritual practice,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
so it would be like asking a
Catholic to give up communion,

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.983 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
other names for you.

00:29:52.983 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Maria Huxley.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.413 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, Maria Huxley, yes.

00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: One of the unsung
heroes of the Psychedelic

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Renaissance was Maria
Huxley, the wife

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
of the great literary
gent, Aldous Huxley.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
What makes her so important
is that when you actually

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
read the "Doors of Perception,"
which is arguably the most

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:84%
famous essay ever written on
the psychedelic experience

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
by Aldous Huxley, he was talking
and thinking in clinical terms,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking to
Humphry Osmond, who

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
was the Canadian psychiatrist
who gave him the mescaline.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
the essay, you find

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that all of these spiritual
ideas came from Maria.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So Aldous and
Humphry are talking

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
about boring clinical staff,
and Maria's like, oh my God,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:90%
enough with this crap.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
She's like, there's something
so much deeper going on.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So she says to Aldous,
focus your mind

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
on the clear light of
the Tibetan Buddhists.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you read the
medical literature

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that came later on
in the later 1950s,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.620 align:middle line:90%
they are all citing Huxley--

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley's "The
Doors of Perception."

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: But the spiritual
idea, that paradigm, that

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:90%
came right from Maria.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now who's Maria Sabina?

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Maria Sabina.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Ah, the two Marias
of the 1950s, yes.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Maria Sabina was a curandera,
which means medicine woman,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
living in Huautla de Jiménez--

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a shaman?

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
like a shaman, yes.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Living in Huautla de Jiménez,
which is a small village

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in Oaxaca.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And she gave mushrooms to two
Americans, one Valentina Wasson

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and her husband
Robert Gordon Wasson,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and they became the
first two Americans

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:84%
to take part in this
kind of sacred ceremony.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up writing very
popular articles and books

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:90%
about their encounter--

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Endorsing this?

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And really showing
like hey, there's not

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
just a medical paradigm, which
was all the rage in the 1950s,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.390 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual
paradigm to this

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we need to
take a deeper look at.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does your personality,
Tom, change at all?

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean you change
over time by doing

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:84%
the work through the
insights that you get,

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's not like you're
going to eat mushrooms or LSD

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
or like take 5-MeO-DMT
or ayahuasca,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to
come back like, wow, I'm

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
cured of everything!

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the work that
is done over time.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of-- in a sense that
seeing a doctor or something.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, like-- think
of it like physical therapy.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Right?

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:90%
You have an injury.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You go see a physical
therapist and they'd

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, work your leg this
way, work your elbow this way.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to you to continue
to work you're like this way

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and work your arm this way and
do the exercises for months

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:84%
after so that you're
healing yourself.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the church
say about psychedelics?

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So interestingly,
during the 1950s,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:84%
the church was absolutely
in favor of using LSD.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And we know guys like Father
JE Brown who would actually

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.680 align:middle line:90%
bless people before their LSD--

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:90%
He actually sent out a mailer.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.987 align:middle line:90%
He's up in Vancouver, Canada--

00:33:05.987 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
well not anymore, he's
passed on since then.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:84%
But when he was up
in Vancouver, Canada,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
he sent out a mailer to
his whole congregation

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:18.080 align:middle line:84%
saying LSD is a gift that
puts us in touch with God

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
and we need to embrace this.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:90%
And you had, I mean, priests.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There was also Ed
Dowling was another one.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Another guy named
Father Murray who worked

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:90%
with Claire and Henry Luce.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And he would bless their LSD
voyages and sit with them

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and give them spiritual advice.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's really--
in the 1950s,

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Catholicism and LSD
went hand-in-hand.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a little
different today

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because LSD is
considered a "drug,"

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
certain teetotalling

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
mindset, which is fine,
other than giving you wine

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:90%
every Sunday.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:90%
But again, that's changing.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I happen to
have it on good authority

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that Harvard is
thinking about starting

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
theological curriculum

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:84%
for these medicines-- and I
can't say too much about that

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
now because I'm not the person
working directly with it.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:84%
A friend and
colleague of mine is,

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'll let him tell
that story when it breaks.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you
say medicines, Tom,

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:84%
what does it do to
help you medically?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So especially
mushrooms in your mind,

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:84%
it helps with what's
known as remyelization.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
In our brains, we have
what's called myelin,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and that breaks down over
time, and actually is

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.437 align:middle line:84%
what causes senility and
Alzheimer's in the elderly.

00:34:37.437 --> 00:34:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --dementia?

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:43.103 align:middle line:84%
Psilocybin mushrooms actually
fix the myelin in your brain.

00:34:43.103 --> 00:34:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think that.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, they do.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So they really-- I mean,
it's like we have the science

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:90%
to back this up.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, oh,
that crazy Tom Hatsis,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:84%
you know he's a weird, witchy
guy who likes mushrooms.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.019 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:56.019 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The guys in the laboratories
are saying this.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
have psychedelics

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.185 align:middle line:90%
been to the human psyche?

00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I think
very important,

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
going all the way back to
the days of ancient Egypt,

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Greece, the Sumerian
civilization.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They have really helped
people for thousands of years

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
in a variety of ways.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben Stewart on "Gaia
News" talks about psychedelics

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and how they may
have influenced who

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:90%
we are as human beings today

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: There's a
possibility that the Stoned Ape

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:90%
theory could lead into this.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the Stoned Ape
theory was really

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:90%
popularized by Terence McKenna.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you would have some
of our ancient ancestors--

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:84%
hominids-- that
would be following

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:90%
around bovine creatures-- cows.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the cow
patties, in the fields,

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
they would naturally, having
followed these creatures

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
around for hundreds of
thousands of years, whatever

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
it might have been, that
they would have started

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:84%
eating the mushrooms, the
psilocybin mushrooms that

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:90%
grow naturally in cow patties.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:84%
These experiences tickling the
language centers of the brain

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and other parts of the
brain bringing down

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the rigidity of the
default mode network

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and activating other
communication hubs

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.020 align:middle line:84%
within the brain,
that could actually

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:84%
explain for the rapid explosion
of the human neocortex.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
In this article,
they're saying that

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:84%
these human-accelerated regions
act differently in humans

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
than they do in primates or
creatures like mice and ferrets

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:90%
that they've looked into now.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So potentially if there is some
connection with the Stoned Ape

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.620 align:middle line:84%
theory, that psychedelics
or psychotropics

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
helped in the expansion
of the human neocortex

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and made us as at least
psychologically so much

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:84%
different than all the rest
of the creatures on Earth,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
then there may be
something to look at here.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, how widespread are
psychedelics being used today?

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: All over the world.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everywhere they're being
used, except for places where

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
they're not available,
but they are being used

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:90%
by people everywhere, really.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
outlawed in every country?

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Portugal has
decriminalized them,

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and so have a lot
of other places.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're starting
to do that around here.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the United States?

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Stoned
Ape theory is concerned,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a neurologist and
neither was Terence McKenna,

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and there are actually
much better explanations

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
for how our brains developed
than through psychedelics.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say that if you were
to take the Stoned Ape theory

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and move it a few hundred
thousand years into the future

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:84%
with civilization
and art and music,

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that's where you can start
to see the influence.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
this Los Angeles Secret

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Society that used LSD.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So during the 1950s,
before the Haight-Ashbury

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.815 align:middle line:90%
scene, before the '60s, and--

00:37:48.815 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before Tim
Leary and all that.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
before all of that,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley and a doctor named
Oscar Janiger would host these

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:90%
LSD parties where they would--

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts would be
a frequent member.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So would actually--
Clark Gable--

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The King of Hollywood would
show up to these LSD parties

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:84%
where they would try to
reenact the Rites of Eleusis.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they just tap into the
mystical nature of LSD.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
societies still exist?

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm part of one of them.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you?

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you go to those?

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I host them
myself about twice a year.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, then we're not
talking about a lot of presence

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No, of course.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.267 align:middle line:84%
Because you want--
you always want

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to make sure to integrate the
experiences to get the most out

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not like alcohol,
it's not even like cannabis,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
although you can have deeply
psychedelic experiences

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:41.855 align:middle line:90%
with cannabis.

00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.995 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: But this
is the kind of thing

00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
you really want to take
the time to integrate.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A kid comes up
to his parents and says,

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.310 align:middle line:84%
mom, I want to try
these mushrooms.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell the kid?

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
how old is the kid?

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 15, let's say.

00:38:57.765 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Too young?

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It's weird,
because in some societies,

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:84%
it could be used as
a rite of passage.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it all has to do
with the context of society

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and how the society
view these things.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So-- and let's say 50
years when, Gaia willing,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
these substances
are parts of a--

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Society.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Then it's really not
all that damaging.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
As long as it's just that
one time within that larger

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:90%
safe container and within--

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I should say within the larger
society that's accepting it,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a path to work
with this, it's not just a kid

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:90%
taking mushrooms.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you prefer
the kid doesn't take it?

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, right now
I think that it's best.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And it also depends
on the kid as well.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot-- you always want
to make sure that the person is

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:10%
in the right state of mind
and they're not just doing it

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.887 align:middle line:10%
because, oh, this
is this fun thing

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:10%
that my friends are doing.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.887 align:middle line:84%
You want to have intention when
you're using these medicines.

00:39:53.887 --> 00:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, how
do people track you?

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Well, if you
go to either YouTube,

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:10%
just Psychedelic
Historian; Instagram,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.370 align:middle line:10%
Psychedelic Historian; Facebook,
Psychedelic Historian--

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.623 align:middle line:10%
if you type Psychedelic
Historian into Google,

00:40:05.623 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm what will come up.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well thank
you for what you do.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've actually learned
more about psychedelics

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.290 align:middle line:10%
in this program than I
have in my entire life.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:10%
And it's very beneficial.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
