00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Our next guest is someone
very special to all of us

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:90%
here at "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Eben Alexander,
a neurosurgeon

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:10%
who had a remarkable
near-death experience that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:10%
not only changed his
life, but changed

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:10%
the life of so many other
people because he wrote

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:10%
several bestselling books,
including "Proof of Heaven,"

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.657 align:middle line:10%
"The Map of Heaven," and
"Living in a Mindful Universe."

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:10%
Eben, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Well,
George, it's great to be here.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.018 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me back on.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I am not kidding,
because your experience,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
came forward with it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was so remarkable and so
persuasive, it, I think,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
changed the lives
of a lot of people

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
who were skeptical
about life after death.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%
You changed a lot of people.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think
that's very reassuring.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I was very skeptical
before my NDE.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:10%
So having that personal
experience and evidence,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:10%
like millions of others
have, helped us to wake

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
up to a bigger reality.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think as a
scientist, I am one

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
who is fascinated by
consciousness and brain

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and mind, this is a very
natural thing for me

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:90%
to be going through.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And my NDE, when I
look back on my life,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
makes perfect sense
that that is what

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
would happen when I was
54 years old and trying

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to find out some deeper
answers about the universe.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And the good news
is a lot of what

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered and in work
with fellow scientists studying

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, is
something that rings

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:90%
true with many, many souls.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
very positive that you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
get that kind of feedback
about our interactions.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's build up to the
near-death experience.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think
it's important to point out

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
at that time I was a 54-year-old
academic neurosurgeon

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and spent more than 15 years
at Harvard Medical School

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
teaching, thinking I knew
something about brain, mind,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And then very suddenly.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I was driven deep into coma.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
The medical details
of my case are

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:10%
available to anyone
who cares to look.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
They were just
published September 2018

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
in the "Journal of Nervous
and Mental Diseases."

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And that case report
is very important.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
It was made by three
independent physicians

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
who were not part of my care.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And they note the extraordinary
nature of my illness--

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.218 align:middle line:84%
that I should have had no robust
conscious experience at all.

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I should have had
basically nothing because

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
of the damage to my neocortex.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why my disease is
such a beautiful gift,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
because it
obliterates the notion

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that the physical brain is
what creates consciousness out

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of nothing.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's where everybody
misses the point.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
modern science is going

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:90%
in a very beautiful direction.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But to cut to the chase,
the experience itself

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
started in an ugly
underground realm--

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:90%
the earthworm's eye view.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:10%
I was rescued from that by this
slowly spinning white light

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:10%
with a perfect musical
melody that took me up

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:10%
into the brilliant ultra-real
gateway valley, that

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:10%
was very Earth-like
in many ways,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.058 align:middle line:10%
but also had strong
spiritual features.

00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And all this, of course,
is described in my book,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:10%
"Proof of Heaven."

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a beautiful
guardian angel on a butterfly

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:90%
wing in that realm--

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:90%
in that gateway realm--

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
who proved extraordinarily
important many months later,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
because it was her
identity that helped

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
me to come to realize
the very realistic nature

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and important
aspect of my journey

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
in terms of my life lessons
and what I was here to learn.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But that gateway valley
was only a stepping stone

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to even higher levels that I
visited in my NDE, all the way

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
out to what I call the core.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The core was infinite
inky blackness,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
but filled to overflowing
with this brilliant light.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I called it a dazzling darkness.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's filled with paradox.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's because that's
where all the duality is--

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
good, bad, black,
white, male, female--

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
whatever the dualities of this
world come together as one.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, that's
where I witnessed

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the pure oneness
of consciousness

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and the origin of our
very conscious awareness

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
with that God force--
the creative source

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:90%
of the whole universe.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
features of that story that

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
are important in terms of the
scientific implications that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
helped me to realize the
absolute reality of this.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
All in the setting when my
doctors had perfect evidence

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
from my neurologic
exams, CT and MRI scans,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
lab values, that this
seven days spent deep

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
in coma due to a
very rare E. coli

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
bacterial meningitis,
which almost always happens

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:90%
in newborns.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Very rare to have E.
coli meningitis in anyone

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:90%
older than three months.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I do have to defend
my level of maturity.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
the whole experience

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
showed me the brain is not
the producer of consciousness.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
When we die, we are actually
liberated to a far higher level

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, as near-death
experiencers have been telling

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%
us for thousands of years.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it was an
extraordinary gift.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How dramatic
did it change your life

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.483 align:middle line:90%
when you came out of that coma?

00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, it's
important to point out

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that one of the essential
features of my journey

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that seemed very
strange at first,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's atypical for a
near-death experience,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:90%
is the fact that I was amnesic.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I had absolutely no words,
language, no memories of Earth,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
of being human, and
certainly, no knowledge

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:90%
of Eben Alexander's life.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the world
my NDE lived in.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Was a
complete empty slate.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And it took me months and
months after I came back

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to realize why that
was so important.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, that effect
was so powerful,

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that when I did come
back to this world on day

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
seven of my coma, my brain
was an absolute wreck.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even recognize
loved ones at the bedside--

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.635 align:middle line:90%
my mother, my sisters, my son--

00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
in reality now?

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.343 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: In reality, when
I came back to this world,

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea who they were.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And those memories
came back very quickly.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have words
or language, as I said.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But words came back
literally within hours.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Much of my language was
completely back within a day.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Childhood memories returned
within a few weeks.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:10%
And the shocker, as I discuss
in detail in our third book,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:10%
"Living in a Mindful
Universe," is that really

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:10%
by about two months after
coma all of my memories

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:10%
had returned.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.513 align:middle line:84%
All of my semantic knowledge of
cosmology, physics, chemistry,

00:06:47.513 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
biology, neuroscience.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:50.847 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Everything
had come back.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my
personal memories--

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and this was gleaned through
conversations with family

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and friends that mimic
conversations that had happened

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
years before my coma--

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I realized the memories
were more complete

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:90%
after I came back--

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:84%
after they came back by
two months post-coma--

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unusual.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.478 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --than
they had been before.

00:07:10.478 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not only unusual, it's
completely inexplicable

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
if you think that memories are
stored in the physical brain.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben, when you shut
down a computer the wrong way,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:90%
you could lose memory.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
In your particular case, you
shut down in the wrong way,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I guess you
can call it the wrong way.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.178 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't it just
wipe out memory totally?

00:07:29.178 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, see,
I think that's part

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
of the lesson is when I woke up
after this incredible journey

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that would be impossible by
our modern neuroscientific

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
assessment of the
role of the neocortex

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:90%
in human conscious awareness.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really it violated
all those principles.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And so initially,
my thinking was,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
as I was trying to
figure all this out,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I defaulted to my pre-coma
neurosurgical view of,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe that's why those
memories were so wrecked

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
during my coma was
because of this disruption

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
of the neocortex.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
to ask how come

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.257 align:middle line:84%
they came back so completely,
even more complete than before?

00:08:09.257 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or more so.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And the one
point I will make here

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
is, as much as people like
to believe that memories are

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
stored in the brain,
one thing we've

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.753 align:middle line:84%
suspected for a long
time in neurosurgery--

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and we don't talk about it
much, because everybody is kind

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
of a physicalist, materialist,
conventional scientist

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
by training-- but that is
that no matter what we've

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.620 align:middle line:84%
done in resecting parts of the
brain over more than 100 years,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
there's never been
a case where you had

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:84%
identifiable swathes
of memory that were

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.942 align:middle line:90%
gone with the resected brain.

00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
That's something
else we talk about

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
in "Living in a
Mindful Universe."

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.232 align:middle line:84%
I talk, in particular,
about the work

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
of Wilder Penfield, one of the
most renowned neurosurgeons

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
He worked in
Canada, in Montreal.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a beautiful
book in 1975

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that summarized his life career
in electrical stimulation

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%
of the brain in awake patients.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.415 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the most direct
way of assessing the mind brain

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:05.215 align:middle line:90%
interface.

00:09:05.215 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And his book,
"Mystery of the Mind," 1975,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:90%
makes it very, very clear.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The brain does not
produce consciousness.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a filter.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It allows consciousness in.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.867 align:middle line:84%
But Penfield came to
realize that memories--

00:09:20.867 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
he thought they were stored
in the neocortex originally,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
but then he had plenty of
evidence that's not the case.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the day, it's very

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
clear to modern
neurosurgeons that memories

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be stored
in the brain at all.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would follow up
with what I've also

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
come to realize since my coma
is the scientific evidence

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
for reincarnation is
really undeniable.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the work
of Dr. Ian Stevenson,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:10%
beginning in the 1960s
at the University

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:10%
of Virginia, Department
of Psychiatry--

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:10%
and he started the Division
of Perceptual Studies.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And in those five or
six decades of study,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that group of scientists
have identified

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
more than 2,700 cases
of past life memories

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
in children where the
best explanation seems

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:90%
to be of actual reincarnation.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And 35% of those
2,700 cases, the child

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
actually has a birthmark
that corresponds

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
with the lethal wound
of a prior injury.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
bring all this up

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.565 align:middle line:84%
is there's a tremendous
amount of scientific evidence

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that memory is not
stored in the brain,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
because all of those
reincarnation cases

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
involve a child with a
new brain growing up.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the memories
they have of a past life

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
are not coming from their brain
that did not experience it.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So memories and
consciousness itself

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
are not created by
the brain at all,

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
but the brain serves
as a reducing valve

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
or filter that allows
primordial consciousness in.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we witness
that as a human being,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think that's
me in there experiencing

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:90%
that consciousness.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have our sensory
systems attached to the body,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and they give you this illusion
of self, and of isolation

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:90%
and of separation.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But that's where I think the
modern consciousness studies,

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
including all the reincarnation
work, work on NDEs,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
work on non-local consciousness,
like precognition,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing,
out-of-body experiences--

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
all of that are showing us that
this world of consciousness

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is far bigger than anything
that you can try and explain

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
with our knowledge of the
physical world as it is.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though when you look
at consciousness and all

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the experiences
that humans have,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
it gives us a beautiful
natural laboratory

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to open up into far
grander explanations

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of reality.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the simple
stuff-- the low-hanging fruit,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
which is what materialist
scientists have studied for 400

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
years of the
scientific revolution--

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily lead
us in that direction.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
study the experiences,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
between brain and mind,

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that's when you start
opening the door

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to a far grander
reality that gives

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
tremendous power to
individual human beings living

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:90%
these lives.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:10%
- In quantum physics,
we talk about there

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:10%
being many simultaneous
possibilities and probabilities

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:10%
all existing at once.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:10%
Until a measurement
or observation, a.k.a.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:10%
a choice, is made.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, upon observation,
one of those possibilities

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:10%
will manifest out while
the others will disappear.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:10%
This is known as
the observer effect

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:10%
and collapsing the wave form.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:10%
How is this observer
effect discovered?

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:10%
It relates to another
aspect of complementarity

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:10%
known as wave particle duality.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:10%
In the early days of
quantum discovery,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:10%
it began with scientists
trying to understand

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:10%
the nature of light.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Is it a wave or
is it a particle?

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:10%
It turns out light
displays both behaviors.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, this confronted scientists
with a mystery, or a paradox.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:10%
How can might be both
a wave and a particle?

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:10%
The paradigm at the time said it
must be either/or not both/and.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:10%
And the mystery
grew when scientists

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:10%
began to wonder whether matter
also could behave as both wave

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:10%
and particle.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:10%
And indeed, it could.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:10%
There have been many
indications and new discoveries

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:10%
in quantum physics that
have confirmed all of this.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:10%
Now, to make a long story short,
if they set up the experiment

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's a wave,
then indeed, they

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:10%
get wave-like behavior.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:10%
But if they set
up the experiment

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:10%
to try and observe
it as a particle,

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:10%
then the behavior changes
to that of a particle.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:10%
It's all about how
the scientists choose

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.885 align:middle line:10%
to set up their observation
or measurement points.

00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:10%
And what's
fascinating is that it

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:10%
is as if the quanta are aware
that they're being observed.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:10%
The very act of observing
has a dramatic effect

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:10%
on their behavior.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:10%
It is a real phenomenon.

is the observer is right
at the core of all of this.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:90%

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Us.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But the important
thing to realize

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is that that observer is not
your thoughts in your head.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:90%
It is not your ego.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It is not your like Eben
Alexander's view of his role,

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:90%
birth to death in this world.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
The observer is far
grander than that.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is something that is
actually liberated at the time

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that the physical brain
and body come to an end.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Our conscious awareness
expands tremendously

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
when it's no longer in the
shackles of the physical brain.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So the observer is
absolutely at the core

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:90%
of understanding all of this.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in a lot of
the work that I do in my books

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and presentations,
I invite people

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to develop a much
richer relationship

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
with that observer, with
that primordial mind.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, a lot
of this thinking

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from the modern evolution
of consciousness studies, which

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
really suggests that we're
all part of one mind.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And that that one mind
is a consciousness that

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:84%
is the creative source
of everything that

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
comes into this universe.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And the way to learn
that more for yourself

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and for the individual seeker
is to develop a practice

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:90%
of meditation, of going within.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I determined this within
two years of my coma.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I knew if I wanted to
understand anything

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
more about my experience, and
especially about consciousness,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I needed to explore
it far more deeply.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is the
way to do that.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is the way to
demonstrate to ourselves

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness
is not something

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that is created in
the dark recesses

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of a three-pound gelatinous mass
floating in a warm, dark bath

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:90%
inside of our head.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But that, in fact, that
is simply an access point.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
The brain allows it to filter.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That allows us to get out
into that primordial mind

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and that observer self.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think
meditation is so important.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why I do all of this
work with Sacred Acoustics

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
for people who are interested
and want powerful tools

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
for deep meditation.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:10%
I encourage them to go
to sacredacoustics.com

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:10%
to learn more.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.708 align:middle line:10%
Or also, you can learn a
tremendous amount in our book,

00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:10%
"Living in a Mindful Universe."

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.667 align:middle line:10%
But you don't even
have to buy the book.

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:10%
You can go on my website,
EbenAlexander.com.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.898 align:middle line:10%
There's a free
33-day email course,

00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:10%
called "Your 33 Day Journey into
the Heart of Consciousness."

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a great
course, too, by the way.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well
thank you very much

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
but the thing that I
love about that course

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is we have people from all
over the world who've taken it.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
More than 6,000 people now.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It has a Translate button, so
it works with all languages.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And people leave their own
comments and experiences.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen a number
of scientists, engineers,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who claim to be
hardcore atheists, who come in

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
and go through that 33-day
course and go, oh my gosh,

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.033 align:middle line:90%
this is so clear.

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It change us.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.119 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It changes you to
realize your spiritual being.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not just birth to
death in one incarnation.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:90%
But you have many incarnations.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self is one
connected to all other beings,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to that divine force at
the core of the universe

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that NDE'ers have been talking
about for thousands of years.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
That is part of each
and every one of us.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Our very conscious awareness
has a direct relationship

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
with that calls of
force in the universe.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And it binds us all together
through love, and compassion,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and kindness, which
are the oldest

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
lessons from our
prophets, and mystics,

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and our religious systems.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
When you get behind the
modern orthodoxies and all,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
it's really all based in that
togetherness and that oneness.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And modern consciousness
studies are

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
proving that from a
scientific viewpoint

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
this is the way the
universe actually works.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how was it
conceived, because it

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:90%
all seems to fit, doesn't it?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the brilliancy of the
body, the mind, consciousness,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:90%
the soul, it's like a glove.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: It is.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.055 align:middle line:90%
It all fits together.

00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did a
creator come up with this?

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I would say we

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:90%
are all part of that process.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is evolving.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I know we talked
before when I was here

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
about Teilhard de Chardin,
"The Phenomenon of Man,"

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful book he wrote
in the mid-20th century.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
He was a French Jesuit priest.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
He happened to be a scientist.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
He was a geologist,
paleontologist.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But he came up with a brilliant
concept that took evolution--

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.818 align:middle line:84%
and in the mid-20th
century, evolution was--

00:18:53.818 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:84%
people thought they
were figuring out

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
how that worked in a
biological system on Earth.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.323 align:middle line:84%
But he looked at it
in a much bigger way.

00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:03.115 align:middle line:84%
And it's because he
knew that consciousness

00:19:03.115 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:84%
was much bigger than
just something coming

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:90%
from a physical brain.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that, in fact,
this existence of this universe

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
is all about the evolution
of consciousness.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And just like they say
all politics is local.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, the evolution
of the universe,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the very reason
for its existence,

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more than the
sum of all sentient beings

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in this process of discovery,
of learning, and teaching.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to
do it together.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:90%
That's why this universe exists.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this
kind of revelation

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
brings tremendous
meaning and purpose

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.983 align:middle line:90%
to each and every one of us.

00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure does.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And to
the very existence

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:90%
of life in this universe.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a soul to
you now at this point, Eben?

00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I
think the best way

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to define the soul is the soul
is what any individual sentient

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
being can come to see
is its direct eternal

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:84%
of infinitely interconnected
aspect of knowing

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
through experience,
through learning,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
through going through
an understanding,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
through dealing with
hardships in this life.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I came from my journey
to see that hardships

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and difficulties, illness
and injury are actually

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
the stepping stones
for our growth.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's what leads us into
remembering the connectedness,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the love of that creative
force, for the creation, which

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
is basically our
relationship with our very

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
conscious awareness
and with that

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
God force at the
core of the universe

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.175 align:middle line:84%
that so many have
come to realize.

00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Not just through
near-death experiences

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and other spiritually
transformative experiences.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But cultivating that
through a program

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:84%
of meditation with a purpose
of trying to learn more

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
about who am I, why am I
here, where is this all going,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.800 align:middle line:90%
how can I influence the outcome.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of
us plays a tremendous role.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's one thing that I
try and portray to every soul

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that I encounter is
everyone is important.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no soul that
is unimportant in this.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that includes a lot of the
naysayers and the doubters--

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --because
they actually

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
present a very important
kind of viewpoint.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And from my point of view,
as I often say in my talks,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:84%
the best ally in this
journey of deep discovery

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of trying to understand
the nature of consciousness

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and existence is a true
open-minded skepticism.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.508 align:middle line:84%
Doubt everything, right
down to ground level.

00:21:34.508 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But have an open mind.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But have
a very open mind.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And that is the gift.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I will
tell you in a discussion

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
of the brain/mind
relationship, which

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
you can look at as a linear
spectrum, with materialism--

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
my conventional
view before coma--

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
physical world is all
that exists, therefore,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the brain must somehow
create consciousness.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:90%
That's one end of the spectrum.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got all
these dualities,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
just as Penfield and many
others have observed.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.783 align:middle line:84%
You cannot reduce
mind to brains.

00:22:03.783 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So they say, OK,
there's something

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
about mind and something
about brain and they coexist.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And you've got all these
dualistic positions

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:90%
in philosophy.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the far end
of the spectrum

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is metaphysical or
ontological idealism.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
That is, that it's
a mental universe.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, that's a
very comfortable idea

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:90%
for quantum physicists.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, I would steer
the scientifically-minded

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
in your audience
to look at nature.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
2005-- Richard Conn Henry, who
is the head of astrophysics

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
at Johns Hopkins
University-- very--

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astute.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --renowned
and astute scientist.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:10%
He wrote a one-page essay
on the mental universe where

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:10%
he made it very clear
that what is emerging

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:10%
in the world of quantum
physics and in understanding

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:10%
of it is just as those
founding fathers, like Erwin

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Schrodinger, and Wolfgang
Pauli, and Eugene Wigner,

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:10%
and others said.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Mind is fundamental.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Mind is at the base of it all.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Mind generates matter.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were very sure of that,
even with those early quantum

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And those experiments have only
gotten more and more refined.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But what they are
all trying to tell

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:90%
us is that mind is fundamental.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:90%
We live in a mental universe.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who questions
mind over matter

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and the reality of it, I'd say,
well, look at placebo effect.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession has
known for more than six decades

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that the placebo effect is a
very nice, a powerful standard

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:90%
to assess it.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.037 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: It's very real.

00:23:36.037 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And it assesses new treatments.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Not only medicines,
but also procedures.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a recent study
of stenting in the coronary

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.280 align:middle line:84%
arteries in Britain that use
a placebo, a sham procedure,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to reveal that what we thought
was so solid-- that is,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.478 align:middle line:84%
coronary stents to
relieve angina--

00:23:54.478 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
was all a matter of
mind over matter.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: That,
in fact, placebo

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
was easily as good
as the results

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:90%
of the procedure itself.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, and some people
misinterpret placebo.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, you're
just fooling somebody.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You give them a sugar pill.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Tell them they get better.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.748 align:middle line:84%
And they get rid
of their headache.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, I would urge you
to look on the Institute

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:10%
of Noetic Sciences website.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:20.020 align:middle line:10%
In the mid-1990s, they
assembled more than 3,500 cases

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:10%
of miraculous healing,
spontaneous regression

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:10%
of cancers, of advanced
infections, even

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:10%
of congenital deformities, of
degenerative diseases, where

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:10%
they showed that a
patient believing

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:10%
they were doing something
that could make them better

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:10%
would basically
make them better.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I can say about that is
that our modern medical schools

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
are finally catching
up on all this

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that that
old materialist science--

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry, and the
physics, and the biology that

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:90%
was taught in medical schools--

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and tried to pretend
that it was all just

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
the interaction of molecules
and nothing more is false.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, a tremendous
amount of healing--

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can demonstrate
all of this as has been done.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The big question in my
mind is how much of what

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
we see and attribute
to medicines

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
that move beyond
that placebo effect

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is actually just placebo
effect in disguise.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting thing.

00:25:17.642 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I mean, we
already know that free will,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:90%
power of prayer--

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
there are many ways to
influence and interact

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
with this primordial mind
that is the determinant

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of our evolving reality.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
developing a relationship

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
with that primordial
mind, that God force,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is so important for all of us
for very practical reasons.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And our health is right
at the top of that list.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:10%
- The number one overall lesson,
whether positive or negative,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:10%
is love.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:10%
Number one, we have to
learn to love ourselves,

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:10%
to really embrace ourselves,
to honor ourselves,

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:10%
and to forgive ourselves.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:10%
Very difficult sometimes.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:10%
But how can you
love another person

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:10%
if you don't love
yourself first?

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:10%
So we must learn the
various aspects of love

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:10%
and loving those
parts of ourselves

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:10%
which perhaps we perceive
as negative or not full.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:10%
We have to love every
aspect of ourselves

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:10%
and then we're able
to love somebody else.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Love is an incredible energy.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Love is the number one energy,
the vibration of the universe.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:10%
And that is really what we
want to align ourselves toward.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:10%
We are all trying
to bring us back

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:10%
to that oneness-- that oneness
of love is what we all are.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:10%
And so we come back
in these lifetimes--

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:10%
this all comes back from
lifetime to lifetime,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:10%
from experience to
experience, from one world

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:10%
to another world, to experience
the various aspects of love

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:10%
and to share that aspect of
love with everybody else.

[END PLAYBACK]

to be saying, Eben,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that if you care
about yourself, you're

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
cure yourself on things.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:90%
very real.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love this--

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I know I've said in my
book, "Proof of Heaven,"

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I said the deepest scientific
truth of my journey

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
was the discovery of the power
of the binding force of love.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:90%
And how we're all bound--

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.072 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --together
through that.

00:27:10.072 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And really the best way
to manifest love for self

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
is to serve as a
conduit, to allow

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that love to flow
through, and love others.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Kindness, compassion,
forgiveness

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:84%
when necessary,
gratitude for all

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:84%
those beautiful relationships
we have with people.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the
tough relationships,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
because they are often
there to serve, again,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.665 align:middle line:84%
just like hardships,
like illness, and injury,

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
the tough
relationships are there

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to help guide us, to learn more.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more we can live our
lives with love in our heart,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
love for self, love for
others, the more this world

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:90%
will change.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the profound lessons
of my near-death experience

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
was coming to see that those
hardships and difficulties

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:84%
truly are the pathway
towards becoming

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
more of who we are here to
be, and that love is really

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:90%
the key.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the empirical
data for the power of love

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
comes from near-death
experiences, which

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:84%
are independent of
your religious beliefs,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:90%
of your cultural beliefs.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:84%
They have a commonality of
the binding force of love

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
going back thousands of
years across all continents.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And the more scientists
study near-death experiences,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:84%
the more they come to realize
that a very deep lesson

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of reality
is that that love is

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:90%
the most important thing.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for me, it became
very clear after my coma

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that this is not a battle
between good and evil.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The forces of darkness
maybe being powerful enough

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to someday overwhelm the
forces of light and love.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that apparent darkness,
the apparent evil in our world,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is really the absence
of the light and love.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when
you talk about evil,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I think back at the horrendous
things that Hitler did

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
or Joseph Stalin for the
Soviet Union at the time.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:90%
How does the planet--

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
how does the universe
compensate for people like that?

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think
that's a complicated question

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But in some ways,
it's also simple.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
If you use the analogy of look
at the world of, say, addiction

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and alcoholism, we
often talk about what's

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:90%
called a gift of desperation.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
when you're wrestling

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
with these kinds of issues, you
circle the drain and head down,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and sooner or later you
realize that you're either

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:84%
going to have to come to some
truth with yourself about

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
things and start learning the
lessons the universe is trying

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to give you or you're
going to come to an end.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, in alcoholism
and addiction, in many cases

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
in our modern
world, which I think

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
is so seduced by the
false sense of separation

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
of scientific
materialism that we

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:84%
start believing that business
of our ego and the demands

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that our ego makes on us.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
massive consumerism,

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:84%
economic polarization,
things like that that

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.260 align:middle line:90%
are very toxic, very damaging.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it really is about
more realizing that oneness,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and that connectedness, and that
it's what we do for ourselves

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and others that gives to
the higher good that I think

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
can really take us in
a beautiful direction.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize that
unconditional love has

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:90%
infinite power to heal.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was one
of the biggest indicators

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
of how all this is
working out with evil, why

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
there can be so much evil.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.163 align:middle line:84%
Because no one doubts the
tremendous amount of darkness

00:30:42.163 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and evil in our
world, even though

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's
improving rapidly.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:10%
I believe the awakening that
many of us in consciousness

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:10%
studies talk about from
a scientific viewpoint is

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:10%
inevitable, in one
sense, but also,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.258 align:middle line:10%
absolutely crucial if we
are to survive as a species.

00:30:59.258 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we talk about a lot

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:84%
in "Living in a
Mindful Universe."

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the reason
this awakening is happening.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, these
kinds of challenges,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
this apparent darkness
and evil that we

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
see of humans
against other humans,

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
is really that gift
of desperation.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can come to our senses
and wake up to the reality

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.670 align:middle line:84%
of this, because the status quo,
especially with any apparent

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming nature of that
selfishness, and greediness,

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and the economic polarization,
the damage to the climate from

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the material excesses,
fossil fuel addiction--

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:90%
what have you--

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.110 align:middle line:84%
is all something that can
come into a much finer balance

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:84%
when we recover this oneness
of connection, binding

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:84%
force of love, and realize
that we're really all here

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
to help each other.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
prayer fit into this?

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, from my point
of view, prayer and meditation

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.390 align:middle line:90%
in many ways are the same thing.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the
way I use meditation.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I use sacred acoustics
to get into very

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:84%
deep transcendental states
of awareness, which to me are

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:90%
a form of centering prayer.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And centering prayer is really
a form of silent prayer.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not going in and
asking for things, other

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
than that thy will, that
the higher good be served.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And especially, when you
start to realize how important

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
it is to get the bigger
picture of your existence

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.863 align:middle line:84%
through an acknowledgment
of reincarnation.

00:32:19.863 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:84%
That you've been here
many times before.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
That you're in a progressive
growth phase of learning that

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:90%
involves other future lifetimes.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:84%
That your relationships
with people in this lifetime

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
are simply reshuffling
of relationships

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
with similar souls
in prior lifetimes,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and that you're all
working together

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:84%
toward something bigger
in future lifetimes,

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:84%
gives us an ability
to see that prayer,

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
opening up to this oneness
of that creative force

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, that
God force, coming

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to realize our alignment
with that force,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
having love in our hearts,
love and compassion,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:90%
kindness for self and others.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
can be easily involved

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:84%
in a prayerful state
of seeking the highest

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:90%
and best good for all involved.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I see many examples
of how prayer

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
has been very powerful
in people's lives to help

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%
give them the outcome needed.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't always mean
you get physical healing.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Although, in so
many cases it does.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've already talked
about mind over matter,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
in general, and the
placebo effect and all

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:90%
of those spontaneous remissions.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the
biggest example of that

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:90%
is in near-death experiences.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
For example, that
case report that I

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
talked about a little
while ago of my case.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Those physicians remarked
on not only the surprise

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that I would have any
conscious experience at all,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
but they even go so
far as to surmise

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
reasons that I had

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.248 align:middle line:84%
such a remarkable
recovery-- and no doctor who

00:33:48.248 --> 00:33:49.790 align:middle line:84%
looks at my medical
records and looks

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
at how I've come out of it all,
would doubt that it's really

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:84%
a miracle, it has no explanation
within Western medicine--

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but you actually find
that kind of healing all

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:90%
through the NDE literature.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, Mary C. Neal,
the orthopedic surgeon who had

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.330 align:middle line:84%
a near-death experience
kayaking in Chile--

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
late 1990s.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Her kayak went under water more
than 10 feet, broke her legs,

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
buried her under
water for 30 minutes.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She couldn't get
out of the kayak, right?

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah, she was stuck
with broken legs in the kayak,

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
more than 30
minutes under water.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't come back from that.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.729 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does.

00:34:21.729 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But she
did because of the power

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
nature of an NDE,

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
which is the same as
the power of prayer,

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:90%
it helped her to come back.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think, similarly, in
the case of Anita Moorjani.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.080 align:middle line:84%
She wrote the book
"Dying to Be Me."

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:10%
And she had a very advanced
lymphoma back in February 2006.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Taken into a hospital room, in
emergency room in Hong Kong.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Any doctor on Earth would
look at her medical facts

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, say she'll
be dead within eight hours,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.430 align:middle line:90%
no doubt.

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's not.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:90%
She lived through it.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:34:51.883 --> 00:34:53.975 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: She had an
NDE in which she realized

00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that if she chose to
come back to this world,

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:90%
her cancer would disappear.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Which it did.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.420 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more and more the
power of the nature of spirit,

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
the power of prayer, how we
all have a connection with this

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
creative force of the universe--
the God force or whatever you

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:90%
want to call it--

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
the very base of our
conscious awareness.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is how this world
can wake up and become

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a far grander, kinder,
more together world.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the world that
we came here to create.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Eben, Larry Dossey
of "Healing Words"

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
talks about the power of prayer
on Gaia's "Inspirations."

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:10%
- I mean, am I denying
my patients something

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:10%
that might be helpful?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.085 align:middle line:10%
- Ah, so are you the block?

00:35:37.085 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:10%
- And I got really
concerned about that.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:10%
The way of resolving
that crisis for me

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:10%
was to look at the
world's literature trying

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:10%
to find other studies
that had to do with this.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:10%
I thought I might uncover
two or three extra ones

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:10%
that I hadn't heard about.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:10%
I came up with a 130.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:10%
And 2/3 of them show that there
is a positive effect from this.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:10%
I began to think this
is the best kept secret

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:10%
in modern medicine.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And so I began to adapt
prayer for all my patients.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's how the book
got published, by the way,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:10%
and written.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:10%
Looking at the data--

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:10%
not just stories,
not just anecdotes--

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:10%
but combining the scientific
research with the stories

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:10%
and that's how "Healing
Words" came to be.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:10%
- And did you pray at the
bedside of these patients?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:10%
- I invented my own
private prayer ritual.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:10%
I would go into my office
early in the morning-- earlier

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:10%
than usual.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Close my door and have my
own private prayer ritual

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.260 align:middle line:10%
that I invented.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.030 align:middle line:10%
- Which was?

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, well, you
really want to know?

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:10%
- I do.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.750 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:10%
- Well, over the
years, my patients

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.030 align:middle line:10%
knew I was interested in
the anthropology of healing.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And so they had
given me as gifts

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:10%
very shamanic rattles and
various herbal incenses

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:10%
from around the world.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.680 align:middle line:10%
- Interesting.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:10%
- And so I concocted
my own ritual

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:10%
where I would burn incense that
shamans and healers were using

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:10%
around the world,
and shake my rattles,

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:10%
and say my healing request
and prayers for my patients

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:10%
that I would be seeing on
hospital rounds that morning

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:10%
and who would be coming
to my office that day.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.790 align:middle line:10%
And I continued
this ritual until I

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:10%
retired from the practice
of internal medicine.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does
work, doesn't it?

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It has
tremendous power.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:10%
And along those
lines, I would also

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:10%
highly recommend Dr. Larry
Dossey's book, the "One Mind."

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:10%
Because he is an identical
twin, and as many people who

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:10%
are twins realize telepathy
is absolutely real.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So he started to investigate
the notion of the connectedness

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of telepathy that's
represented through twins,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.680 align:middle line:84%
but then expanding
it tremendously

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:90%
into the animal world.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I won't get into
all of it, but it's

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.725 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful book about the
nature of consciousness.

00:37:59.725 --> 00:38:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But it really
points at the same thing--

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the power of prayer,
the connectedness

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:84%
with the conscious
element of the universe.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
showing us that there

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:13.900 align:middle line:84%
are top-down organizational
principles in this world that

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.770 align:middle line:84%
completely help us explain
how all this works.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:84%
That are not the same as
the bottom-up assumptions

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:90%
of modern--

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:84%
the conventional science that
I studied before my coma, which

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
tries to pretend that all
the events in human lives

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
are nothing more than electrons,
protons, atoms, molecules.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.930 align:middle line:84%
All of it just following natural
laws of physics, chemistry,

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:90%
biology.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that it's all kind of
predictable at the outset,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness emerges
from those physical processes.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why in modern
consciousness studies,

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
we realize that's
completely backwards.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Larry Dossey, I think,
is way ahead of the curve,

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:84%
as he has been for decades in
showing the power of prayer,

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's very real, that
we're spiritual beings, living

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.560 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual universe,
and that quantum physics

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most profound
kind of proofs of that.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But it also shows us
that this world around us

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:90%
is not exactly as it appears.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it gets
very, very interesting.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But all of it starts pointing
to the primacy of consciousness

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and the power of our free will.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Because materialist
science, like

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I worshiped it before my coma--

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and I don't use
that term lightly--

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
would have very proudly told
you that you have no such thing

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:90%
as free will at all.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the universe
exists for sentient beings

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:90%
to manifest free will.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That's what that whole evolution
of consciousness is all about.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So before my coma, like most
of conventional science,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:90%
we had it completely backwards.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had you not had your
near-death experience, Eben,

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.167 align:middle line:84%
would you be where you are
right now in terms of knowledge?

00:39:50.167 --> 00:39:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It would've
taken me a little longer,

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:84%
but I would have paid
attention to these arguments.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:84%
The logic, the evidence,
the rational argument

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
supporting the primacy
of consciousness,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that we are eternal spiritual
beings in a spiritual universe,

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.030 align:middle line:90%
is overwhelming.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.288 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: In
fact, what you find

00:40:07.288 --> 00:40:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is most of those people
who claim to be skeptics

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.170 align:middle line:90%
are really pseudo-skeptics.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
read the literature,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
because they've made up their
mind that it's impossible

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:84%
based on their
theoretical frameworks.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But their theoretical frameworks
go nowhere on the issue

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
If some materialist
scientist tells you,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:84%
yes, the brain
creates consciousness.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, play along.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Say yes, well, tell me more.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.020 align:middle line:90%
You won't get a thing.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
fundamental and primary.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
have free will.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:90%
We have power over our destiny.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:84%
We have tremendous power
over our very health.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
beautiful lesson

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.350 align:middle line:84%
coming from modern
consciousness studies.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's part of
that awakening, that world

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
revolution that, in fact, is
essential if we are to survive.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
precognition, telepathy,

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.620 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:90%
this is all tied together?

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It's
all tied together.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's one
of the big problems

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is so much of our culture
is based in this the world

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:90%
of the expert.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's get the expert in.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that the
only experts on consciousness

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.643 align:middle line:84%
are people who
study consciousness.

00:41:21.643 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Studying the brain does not make
you an expert in consciousness.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or who have gone
through things like you have.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.773 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, that is true.

00:41:27.773 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Or people who have
explored consciousness

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and get to know so
much more about it.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's such
a crucial part of this.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But the experts are
coming into alignment now.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:41.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, back in
November, Karen and I

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.430 align:middle line:84%
were in London for the opening
of the Galileo Commission.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.090 align:middle line:10%
I would advise all of
your viewers to check out

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.660 align:middle line:10%
GalileoCommission.org.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And more than 100
scientific advisors--

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of them, but there
are many around the world who

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.940 align:middle line:84%
study consciousness--
and they put out

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.940 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful commission
report that makes it very clear

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that our conventional science
of materialism is dead.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It actually died
about 80 years ago.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And this paper is a very
important clarion call

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to this world to wake up to
the fundamental existence

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and the power
of our free will over all

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:90%
of our evolving future.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And that we have an important
responsibility in every choice

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
we make in our
lives to honor that.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is probably
one of the biggest lessons.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the materialist science
that I worshipped before that

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:84%
would say you have
no free will, they

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:84%
say that because
they believe it's

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
just the substance, the
brain, the electrons, atoms,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:84%
molecules, following the laws
of physics, chemistry, biology.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So if it's all just chemical
reactions and electron fluxes,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:84%
where do you insert
any kind of free will?

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the observer
effect, the lessons of quantum

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.530 align:middle line:84%

open the door to a far grander
reality about who we are

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and this awakening and the
nature of consciousness itself.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:10%
- The only thing that stands
between you and the life

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:10%
that you want of love,
and fulfillment, and joy,

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:10%
and appreciation, and
gratitude, and contentment,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:10%
and humbleness, and
clarity, and forgiveness,

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:10%
and love are matters of choice--

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.610 align:middle line:10%
your choice.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And you will see how
powerful your choice

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:10%
is when you realize
that you will never

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:10%
be judged by the universe
for whatever choice you make,

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:10%
because there's learning
in every choice.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:10%
So why choose violence?

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Why choose fear and doubt, when
you can choose love and trust?

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.620 align:middle line:10%
You're on a quest
for authentic power

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:10%
and nothing can
prevent that quest.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:10%
Your only choice is the
nature of the experiences

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:10%
that you will have
on that quest now.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And those depend
on your choices.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:14.980 align:middle line:10%
This is more than a moral talk.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:10%
This is a talk about evolution.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:10%
Because as you make
those choices--

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:10%
choices of love
instead of fear--

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:10%
you not only assist in the
maturation of your personality,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.970 align:middle line:10%
you not only become
capable of giving the gifts

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.290 align:middle line:10%
that you were born to give,
you also assist your soul

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:10%
in its evolution.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you write
about the power of choice

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:90%
in your latest book.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: We do.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's very important.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And Gary Zukav is a
good friend, and I

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:84%
have been very pleased with
his work, in great agreement.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I think he shows
us something very

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.320 align:middle line:84%
deep about that power
of choice and how

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:90%
we are truly responsible.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
near-death experiences

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
would supplement
that notion with is

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:90%
it's not just our actions.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go through
a life review, which

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
has been very commonly described
in near-death experiences going

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:84%
back at least 2,400 years
to the time of Plato,

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:84%
what you realize
in the life review

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is that even your
thoughts have an impact.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
so important to--

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --be
mindful of what

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking, and our
thoughts and our emotions.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the life review shows
very clearly, as so many

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.450 align:middle line:84%
describe it, that you
experience it not as yourself.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You experience it
as those around you

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.570 align:middle line:84%
who were impacted by your
thoughts and actions.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful
example of showing us

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are not our little
self and our little ego,

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
but that, in fact, we
are part of that far

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.160 align:middle line:90%
grander consciousness.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about the
dream of that primordial mind.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It is working through all
this in a very active fashion.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But each and every one of us
is learning in that process

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
through our relationships with
others and acknowledging--

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.930 align:middle line:84%
because in the life review, any
pain or suffering that you've

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.637 align:middle line:84%
handed out to others,
you will feel,

00:46:14.637 --> 00:46:16.095 align:middle line:84%
you will have the
emotional impact.

00:46:16.095 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It comes
back, doesn't it?

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.873 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: You talked a
little while ago about Hitler.

00:46:19.873 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I would not envy
that life review.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.970 align:middle line:90%
More than 53 million deaths.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:26.312 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Not to
mention all those

00:46:26.312 --> 00:46:30.800 align:middle line:84%
impacted by the actions
of him with that war.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
His life review
would be incredible.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.370 align:middle line:90%
What a learning experience.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But he had to experience every
bit of that pain and suffering.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:39.650 align:middle line:90%
We reap what we sow.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think he has
reincarnated and is getting

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.370 align:middle line:84%
better or do you think he has
been put in fire and brimstone?

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: No, I--
first of all, it's

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:84%
important to point
out that Earth time is

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:90%
part of the stage setting.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.992 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, when you say,
has he already reincarnated,

00:46:57.992 --> 00:47:00.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a question that really
doesn't have much meaning

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:84%
when you consider that there
is a temporal flow, that I call

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.660 align:middle line:84%
deep time, in the
spiritual realm that

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is much more of an alignment
of our lessons learned

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.430 align:middle line:90%
and our journeys.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, by definition,
nobody ever

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:84%
reincarnates before they
had to be present there

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.800 align:middle line:84%
for all loved ones
and others who were

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:90%
crossing over-- what have you.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a deeper
ordering of causality.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So all I can say is that
Hitler's life review would not

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:84%
be anything that I think Hitler
would want to go through,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.850 align:middle line:84%
but he chose that for his
own pathway, his higher soul.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one to
sit here and define

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.260 align:middle line:84%
how we can explain
all the depths

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of evil and apparent darkness
we've seen in this world.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that they all
are there for a purpose to help

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.345 align:middle line:84%
to guide us towards that
oneness, towards love,

00:47:49.345 --> 00:47:50.720 align:middle line:84%
just as near-death
experiencers--

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.300 align:middle line:84%
people who have been to that
other side and then come back

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:90%
to this world to talk about it--

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.230 align:middle line:90%
share the importance of that.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.960 align:middle line:84%
When we see the
good side of humans

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
in dealing with hardships,
whether it's a natural disaster

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or human on human conflict, we
see beautiful examples of love,

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love,
being the overwhelming force

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.442 align:middle line:90%
in the equation.

00:48:13.442 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that that is really

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:90%
the deepest lesson of all this.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And as much as people--

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:84%
it can become
overwhelming if you

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.020 align:middle line:90%
dwell on the darkness and evil.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you can rise
above it a bit--

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I often repeat
those words that I first said

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.760 align:middle line:90%
when I came out of coma--

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
saying these words,

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.640 align:middle line:84%
but everybody at
the bedside told me

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I said it over and over again--

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:90%
all is well.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:90%
All is well.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And what that really means
is when you meditate,

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.250 align:middle line:84%
go into this, develop this
relationship with higher soul,

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.150 align:middle line:84%
you start to get the big
broad overall view that

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:54.080 align:middle line:84%
incorporates all of it, and
can see a win-win situation.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I came to see that some
people who before my coma

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I looked at as my nemesis,
as an enemy, someone who

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.250 align:middle line:84%
is preventing me from
getting things in my life

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted, in fact,
was a near and dear soul

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:84%
mate who was helping me
to learn a tough lesson.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: We're
all in this together.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.452 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:49:10.452 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: So always try to
take that bigger, higher view

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.470 align:middle line:84%
where you can see how love
really connects us all.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And even those who seem to be
bringing badness into our lives

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.270 align:middle line:84%
or into the world, in some ways
are helping us to examine more

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.910 align:middle line:84%
deeply and come up with
something that makes

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:29.730 align:middle line:84%
more sense about connectedness,
and purpose, and growth

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
towards this oneness, towards
what Teilhard de Chardin was

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:34.620 align:middle line:90%
discussing.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.397 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
this is all headed.

00:49:36.397 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would I
have liked you before

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.787 align:middle line:90%
your near-death experience?

00:49:39.787 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I don't know.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I think.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.608 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you like you?

00:49:45.608 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah, I did.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I liked me, but I had a
lot of growing up to do.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially, I would
say as I evolved beyond my NDE,

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and took on this much
broader view of self,

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and my role in my life,
and started doing past life

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:84%
regressions, and getting
some kind of idea

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of the context in which I might
actually be an eternal spirit.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It's always a case
of all is well.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the key is you need to
be able to realize that bigger

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.940 align:middle line:84%
picture and how all this has
a positive direction in it.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
reincarnation,

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not the blind
mechanistic wheel

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of some religious systems.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's very much goal-directed.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's towards
that sense of love,

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and of prosperity
for all, and of true

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.080 align:middle line:90%
brotherhood and sisterhood.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
realizing that this is not

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.080 align:middle line:90%
just about humans at all.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about all life
throughout the cosmos.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a much bigger
deal than we currently

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
can discern from our limited
materialistic four-dimensional

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:90%
space time view.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's why
exploring consciousness

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and developing a much richer
relationship with our higher

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.010 align:middle line:84%
soul, with that
primordial mind, is

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.830 align:middle line:84%
so crucial in our
personal growth,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and also in the evolution of
all of life in the universe,

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and certainly, of humanity's
coming into its own

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.515 align:middle line:90%
in the current era.

00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying?

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Not at all.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Dying is an adventure.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It is a release from--

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No rush.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.387 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: --the shackles.

00:51:17.387 --> 00:51:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm in no rush now.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe I still have much
work to do in this world.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I believe--

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me too.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --for one
thing I can't remotely claim

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to have a perfect
understanding of this primacy

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
the primordial mind

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.250 align:middle line:84%
hypotheses that we explore in
"Living in a Mindful Universe,"

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.040 align:middle line:84%
but I certainly can see the
direction in which it's headed.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And for me that direction
absolutely depends on science,

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because science is the way
that we share information

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and we come to what's
known as consilience.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Consilience is basically
a statement that,

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.350 align:middle line:84%
when you examine a
certain profound problem

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.140 align:middle line:84%
from very different
directions, if they all

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
start converging on the
same thing, that is what

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.890 align:middle line:90%
we should discern as truth.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And just to cut to
the chase, I would

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:10.530 align:middle line:84%
like to say in this discussion
consilience synthesizes two

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of most profound mysteries
to modern science.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:17.010 align:middle line:84%
One is the measurement
paradox, observer effect,

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:84%
what's known as contextually
in quantum physics.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And the other is the
mind/brain connection as

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.680 align:middle line:84%
examined through neuroscience
and philosophy of mind.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
a fascinating example

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:84%
of consilience is how
both of those very

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.520 align:middle line:84%
broad, deep examinations
of the nature of reality

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
by very intelligent
insightful people

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.790 align:middle line:84%
are all leading to the same
conclusion of the primacy

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:46.440 align:middle line:84%
of mind and the power
we have to manifest

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:90%
the world of our dreams.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
amazing how it works.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems complex, but it's
very simple, isn't it?

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: It is.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely
beautifully simple.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:84%
When you can summarize it
in the phrase "all is well"

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and fully understand
what that means,

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.850 align:middle line:84%
come to realize that
things like life reviews

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:84%
just show us that
the golden rule--

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.610 align:middle line:84%
do unto others as you would
have done unto yourself--

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.400 align:middle line:84%
is written into the very
fabric of the universe.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we come to acknowledge
these deep and profound lessons

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.660 align:middle line:84%
in a scientific sense,
the spiritual nature

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of our very being
and of this universe,

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.798 align:middle line:90%
we will grow tremendously.

00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to
assume for a moment, Eben,

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that you are standing
at the deathbed of one

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:90%
of your patients.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:90%
The time has come.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them now?

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: What I tell
them is that what they

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.380 align:middle line:84%
are about to witness is
the most beautiful example

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.340 align:middle line:84%
of the connectedness of
souls throughout the cosmos,

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness with the
very prime creative force

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of this universe, and that
they will find greater love

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and comfort than
they've ever witnessed

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.310 align:middle line:84%
in this four-dimensional
incarnation, unless, of course,

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:02.220 align:middle line:84%
they developed a very active
practice of going within.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you can certainly
come to see this,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:84%
know this, through being
open-minded, and living

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:84%
these lives, and seeing the
love, the power of forgiveness

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance and mercy on
all fellow beings beginning

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:84%
with that soul
that you know best.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:22.890 align:middle line:84%
This is all about coming into
greater discovery of that.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.440 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I would
assure them of--

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and I'm most assuring of this--

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:31.470 align:middle line:84%
is that when you die,
your conscious awareness

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.543 align:middle line:90%
becomes far grander.

00:54:33.543 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.665 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we teach
this in school?

00:54:36.665 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I mean, that's

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.370 align:middle line:84%
what we're trying to do is
bring this reality to the world.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, what I see in this
world in the last decade

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.690 align:middle line:84%
is a tremendous amount of
growth along these lines.

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how many
scientists, engineers,

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:58.380 align:middle line:84%
modern scientifically-educated
people contact me and are very

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.510 align:middle line:84%
grateful for the big view that
this kind of thinking brings

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.080 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
all about all of us

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.500 align:middle line:84%
coming to greater
knowing of self

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and of others and of these
very deep principles.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It's wisdom that's been in this
world for thousands of years.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Go back to Vedic texts.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Go back to eastern and
western spiritual origins,

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
the original
teachings of prophets.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many of them glimpsed
this, knew this, felt this,

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:31.950 align:middle line:84%
were co-creating
it even back then.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So in so many ways, it's
not like this is big news.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.160 align:middle line:90%
But it really is--

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's the
culmination of the 400

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.040 align:middle line:84%
years of the scientific
revolution trying

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of this
world in a way that

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond personal
experience and just what

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.115 align:middle line:84%
an individual could discern
from their own life experience.

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But we really need
to know what's

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.140 align:middle line:90%
the bigger human experience.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.310 align:middle line:84%
What can we all truly share
about the nature of reality?

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think this
kind of awakening is so crucial.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.017 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course, it
also, as I said earlier,

00:56:05.017 --> 00:56:06.600 align:middle line:10%
it's part of that
gift of desperation,

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.860 align:middle line:10%
because the status quo,
the economic polarization--

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.610 align:middle line:10%
the wealth is far, far,
far too concentrated

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:10%
in a tiny pocket in this
country and around this world.

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:10%
we really need to have a far
grander vision of sharing

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:24.360 align:middle line:10%
and of taking care
of each other,

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.630 align:middle line:10%
taking care of the least,
the last, and the lost,

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:30.330 align:middle line:10%
realizing we're all
in this together.

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And that the only
thing that is important

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:90%
really is our soul journey.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.710 align:middle line:10%
And in the soul journey, as
any near-death experiencer

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.640 align:middle line:10%
will tell you, you never
go through it and think,

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.698 align:middle line:10%
well, I should have had
a Porsche or a yacht.

00:56:42.698 --> 00:56:44.490 align:middle line:84%
That would have made
my life more complete.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's about the relationships.

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It's about the love.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It's about the power that
comes from helping others.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that
that's the best

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:57.240 align:middle line:84%
way to essentially
concentrate focus

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and resonate with
this beautiful love

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that the creator
has of the creation,

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can each come to
know in our own existence

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
simply through
opening our minds,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.440 align:middle line:84%
feeling the emotional power
of all this, and yet, also,

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.440 align:middle line:84%
developing that relationship
with our higher soul, which

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.428 align:middle line:84%
is one of connectedness
and purpose.

00:57:15.428 --> 00:57:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eben, thank you.

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:20.130 align:middle line:10%
Not only for being on "Beyond
Belief," but for sharing

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:22.120 align:middle line:10%
truly a remarkable
story of your life.

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.462 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
thank you, George.

00:57:24.462 --> 00:57:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure to
talk with you and thanks

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.470 align:middle line:90%
so much for having me back.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Eben Alexander,
our remarkable guest here

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.340 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.610 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever doubted the
possibility of the existence

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.580 align:middle line:84%
of the other side,
don't doubt it any more

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.020 align:middle line:90%
when you listen to him.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
