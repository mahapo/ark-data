00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.492 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.504 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:19.170 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.272 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.411 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to give
people the information.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRTOR: And now, the host
of the nationally syndicated

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.211 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: How many
times have you thought,

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I lived another life?

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I lived in Egypt.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I was even further back.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.404 align:middle line:90%
That's called reincarnation.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things we're

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Our guest is an expert
in hypnotherapy.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
He regresses people
back to different ages

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and different eras.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.825 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bruce, how are you?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.698 align:middle line:84%
>> BRUCE GOLDBERG:
Good, Thank you.

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
How did you, starting off
as a practicing dentist,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:90%
get involved in hypnotherapy?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It all
began in my last life.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I used hypnosis for dental
purposes, apprehension

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:90%
and pain control.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But I had read the story of
"The Search for Bridey Murphy,"

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
a documented case of
reincarnation from Colorado,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
by the way, Pueblo,
Colorado, back in the 1950s.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to try
it, as an experiment,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and see if it worked.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the very first
person I worked

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:84%
with after I was
trained with hypnosis

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.307 align:middle line:84%
went back into nine
different lives.

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.056 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And she was
able to overcome two habits

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:47.047 align:middle line:84%
and a phobia that I
wasn't even aware of.

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now when
that was happening,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
when these different
lives were popping up,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
what were you thinking?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.193 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, first, I
thought this is interesting.

00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But see, there's
another issue here.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clinician.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I saw the therapeutic
aspect of it,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
especially since I wasn't
even trying to work with her

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and she made major
breakthroughs.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And that said to
me, wait a minute!

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, when the
student is ready,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
the teacher will be there, is
an old metaphysical expression.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to, then,
become more expert with this

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and then develop
other techniques.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So that led to 35,000 past life
regressions and future life

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:84%
progressions later, over 15,000
patients, my full-time practice

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
being hypnotherapy
for many, many years.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So I gave up dentistry and
moved out to California.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But I had practiced
hypnotherapy full-time,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.561 align:middle line:84%
even on the East Coast
when I was there.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Dentistry was part time.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.009 align:middle line:84%
So this has been a calling
and a major part of my life.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A Little bit later on
in the program, Dr. Goldberg,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to regress
somebody from the audience.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see what happens.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been with you before
on various regressions,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and you had one woman
going back to the time

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that she was in Egypt.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there watching this

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in awe, my mouth
open, as she talks

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
about the era of
Cleopatra, pyramids.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
this just can't be.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.444 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
to this, isn't there?

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's not just
the emotional aspect that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
particular women related to,
but it was also the therapeutic

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
breakthroughs that she made.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
what happens is, we

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
have a soul or a
subconscious mind,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
which is electromagnetic
radiation,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
just like a television
or radio signal.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:90%
The problem is it's compromised.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a higher self,
or the super conscious mind,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
what Plato named
2,3000 years ago.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you connect
the two, then you

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:84%
can raise the quality of the
signal of the subconscious mind

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and overcome habits, phobias,
self-defeating sequences

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, procrastination,
anxiety, depression,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
anything that
compromises a person.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you can raise them up so
that they can overcome issues.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
theme of what I do.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So more of a psychic
empowerment is what I call it.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.559 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you
regress somebody, then,

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not just to find out
how many past lives they had,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
or what they did in
these past lives.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You're actually trying to solve
some kind of an affliction,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.007 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a problem that
they have in this current life,

00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, that's
why they come to see me

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not just curious.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
But most of them have issues.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
They have issues of emotional
issues, habits, phobias, et

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
They want to make more money
in life, abundance issues.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to meet
their ideal soul mates.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
They want to do anything
that people want to do.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is a mechanism
that is designed,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
its natural, and
it's something that's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
been around for
thousands of years.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.826 align:middle line:84%
You know Neanderthal man
believed in reincarnation.

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They buried their dead and
painted the bones ochre,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
which is a red color, and buried
their instruments and food

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
for the future life.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.085 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians copied that.

00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So this has been
around for 300,000 to 400,000

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
ancient approach

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that nothing else is
older than reincarnation.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bruce, why does
a person's past problem

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in another life,
whatever it might be,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
carry on to these other lives,
where you need to regress

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:90%
somebody to try to cure them?

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Because they
haven't learned a lesson.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Why do the same people
get traffic tickets?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Why do the same people
get divorced eight times?

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.403 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's because
they haven't learned it.

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So, if you learn your lessons,
you pass your karmic test,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
then you move on
to the next level.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Give me an example
of somebody who had a lifestyle

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
problem based on
their past life,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.496 align:middle line:84%
and how you got
them out of that.

00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
the best example is,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.307 align:middle line:84%
the most famous case of mine,
is the case that was made

00:05:27.307 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
into the CBS movie "The Search
for Grace" about a women.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I call her Ivy.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
She was a single
woman, young woman,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
very attractive, very
bright, very well-educated,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and dating a man
who was married.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.982 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
he tried to murder her

00:05:39.982 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
on three different occasions.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my God.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And she continued to date him?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.333 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And she couldn't
break up the relationship.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turned
out, in 46 past lives,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
regressions that we did, she was
with him 20 of those 46 lives.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And he murdered her
in every single life.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't get it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we worked with her,
bringing up the past lives,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of course, but more
importantly, doing

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
what I call the super
conscious mind tap,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
introducing her subconscious
of her higher self,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
she was able to make
the breakthrough

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
necessary to end
the relationship.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, she
progressed and today

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is a very happy camper.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, is
that she couldn't get it.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't a stupid woman.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.877 align:middle line:90%
OK, this was not--

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it's just
there, it's in them.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's because
it's a karmic carryover.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.348 align:middle line:84%
The people that you know
in your life, the most

00:06:26.348 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
emotional, highest correlation,
whether you love them or hate

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
them, they're going to be what
we call karmic relationships.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.795 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you've
known in the past lives.

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So because of that
severing that you helped her

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
through, in her next life,
assuming she has one,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:90%
will she make that same mistake?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.319 align:middle line:90%
Or is she basically cured now?

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, she's cured
now because she's not doing it

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
If she ends it now,
her future lives

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.552 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a
whole lot more fun.

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But if she was all of a
sudden getting involved

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
in another relationship that
was equivalent to the quote

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
"Johnny" relationship,
as I called him,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
then that would be
a different issue.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
So you can tell.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Once you overcome,
learn the karmic lesson,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
make the breakthrough,
and show it now

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.714 align:middle line:84%
with a permanent situation, in
other words, no relapse, then

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
you're done with that
particular lesson.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.754 align:middle line:84%
Then you move on
to the next one.

00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But they get easier as
you go along, you see?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about him?

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
What about the guy who would
murder her so many times, now

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
it's been stopped, what kind
of issues does a guy like that

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:90%
have?

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, I
never worked with him.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you, when
he crosses into spirit,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
or clinically
dies, he's probably

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.494 align:middle line:84%
going to share a condo with
Saddam Hussein with Adolf

00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Hitler and a few
others, you know?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So that happens.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.606 align:middle line:90%
That's real, isn't it?

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:37.184 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah, He's
not what you call a keeper.

00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are those the kind
of people who keep coming back

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.762 align:middle line:84%
time and time again
to reincarnate.

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
the same problems,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a child, a husband,
wife, a neighbor, or whatever

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
it is, if you have the
same pattern-- for example,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
women will be
attracted to a man who

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
is a gambler, an alcoholic,
who beats them up,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:90%
or who cheats on them.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Same pattern, over
and over again.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They may look differently,
but the same pattern.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
breaking the pattern.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to break patterns
to grow spiritually.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A little boy in
Chicago would tell his parents

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
about a Concorde plane
from World War II.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And he would explain
things about this plane

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:90%
that only pilots knew.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
That the tires would
blow out upon landing.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
That they had other
problems in the air.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And he would spout this to them.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.615 align:middle line:84%
And they would
just listen to him,

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
going where was he
getting this information?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced, and it's a
case I'm sure you've looked at,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
where he was, indeed,
a World War II pilot.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And they took him
to a reunion and he

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.702 align:middle line:90%
knew some of these people.

00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely riveting.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And he looked
like his previous life, too.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he looked
the previous person.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: That was
the James Leininger case.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.585 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And his case is
very dynamic because a kid

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
at his age, he was like
eight or nine at the time.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.636 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: At the time, yeah.

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: He would have
vocabulary and knowledge far

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.108 align:middle line:84%
beyond his expertise,
military knowledge.

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.607 align:middle line:84%
Where does an eight--
you know, they

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:04.035 align:middle line:84%
don't get that on
Saturday morning cartoons.

00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.884 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore, that's
one of the examples

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:90%
of the physical characteristics.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, the late Ian
Stevenson, the great researcher

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in reincarnation of the
University of Virginia

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
for 50 years, he would,
in his latter work,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
show that there was a lot
of physical characteristics

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that carry over.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
For example,
somebody gets stabbed

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
in the right lower
quadrant of their abdomen,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
they reincarnate
years later, and they

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:90%
have a scar right there.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Scar there.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Or a birthmark.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or pain, or
something like that.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
the pain is one thing.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But the physical, I'm talking
about the physical actual

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
representation, birthmarks of
unusual shape will carry over.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So these are examples.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.987 align:middle line:90%
They don't prove reincarnation.

00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We can only give what we
call suggestive evidence.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's a heck of a
lot suggested evidence.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do some
people, like James Leininger,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
why do they have some
recollection and other people

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.259 align:middle line:90%
just don't?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, why do
people use computers quickly,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.383 align:middle line:84%
and why do people throw
footballs very well?

00:09:57.383 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural ability
that we all have.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.205 align:middle line:90%
We all have certain things.

00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people go into
hypnosis much deeper,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
they're more emotional, they
get more detailed information

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
from a regression
or a progression.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just a natural ability.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes they have blocks.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.644 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are afraid
to see a past or future life.

00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to be a
harder person to work with.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.185 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has
their-- you have

00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to look at the psyche and
the pschodynamics of who

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that person is before you can
just make a general statement.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Should
everyone get regressed,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.712 align:middle line:84%
just to find out who their
past lives might have been?

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: I think everyone
not only should be regressed,

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.086 align:middle line:84%
but they should be
progressed into the future,

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
a field I developed, and they
should access their higher self

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and to be all they can be,
like the old Army commercial.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, people are
not maximizing their potential.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
problems in this country.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:90%
People are depressed.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
We're the fattest
country the world.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.566 align:middle line:90%
We have got a lot of issues.

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And those are all reversible
if you get your act together.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you're just
going to repeat history.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.721 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, I believe that.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You have looked at my future.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a future talk show host,
my name is Dexter Monterrey.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Dexter Monterey,
you love that name, don't you?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In the
future I do that.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.585 align:middle line:84%
And then, who am I in
the year 3000, or so?

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:08.665 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: See this is
something that-- well,

00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:09.775 align:middle line:90%
we discussed this on the radio.

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Zeo.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.064 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Zeor, you
don't like Zeor as much.

00:11:12.064 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Zeor is a much--

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, I don't
talk much about him.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: I'll tell you why,
because I know you'll like--

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.018 align:middle line:84%
look, Dexter Monterrey,
for the audience,

00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Dexter Monterrey is a
man in the 22nd century,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
working for the Global
Communications Network, GCM.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: 100 million
listeners on his show.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.555 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: In a big mall.

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:29.406 align:middle line:84%
And there's a hologram of
you with a white jumpsuit.

00:11:29.406 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a hologram on their
little radios, like these high,

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
fast, these computer radios,
these are exotic radios.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So they see a little
picture of you,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
like Princess Lea from
"Star Wars" here, OK?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Always there.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.783 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Always there.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's -- what you're doing
there is energy healing psychic

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.565 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And what you did in that, and
will do in the future life,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is you will uncover what's
called the mind pirates, which

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
are people who develop
techniques to steal ideas

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.974 align:middle line:84%
from the scientists
and inventors,

00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and sell them on
the black market.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.973 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huh.

00:11:55.973 --> 00:11:58.479 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And you uncover
it and end that mentality.

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:00.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
get your fame from.

00:12:00.145 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Now the psychic
research part is more important

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.821 align:middle line:84%
because in the 35th century,
when you become Zeor.

00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The guy I
don't talk about much.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: He develops a
technique with these large

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
brass rings that actually
cleanses the soul's energy

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and makes people more
spiritually evolved, OK?

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
interesting technique

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
because what we call the
black brotherhood, which

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.844 align:middle line:84%
is these lower astral entities,
the lower astral plane.

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like them the
movie "Ghost," those thinks?

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Right, right.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They go after you.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.994 align:middle line:84%
And you use these rings
to protect yourself,

00:12:30.994 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, when
you're getting this award

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.576 align:middle line:84%
for this psychic
discovery, because this

00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:84%
is a major achievement,
almost like a Nobel Prize,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
they fail and you succeed
because of your techniques.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And you help, actually,
in the future,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
you will also help
time travelers

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
who come back in
time because you

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
help cleans their auras so they
can make the trips more safely.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.587 align:middle line:84%
So the Zeor life
is a very-- it's

00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate of
your karmic purpose.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Because right now you're doing--
look, you have people like me

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.419 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with-- maybe
you're not doing research,

00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
but you're giving us the
format, the forum for presenting

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
information about psychic
development, psychic research,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
of all levels.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So see, this is the
beginning phase.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Dexter Monterrey, with your
really cool name, by the way,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:90%
is the next phase.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.474 align:middle line:84%
And then Zeor is your
ultimate karmic purpose.

00:13:14.474 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
some of your questions

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
from the audience for
Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Who would like one?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:90%
You.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have a question
for you related to karmic debt.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.411 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when you have
settled your karmic debt,

00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
before you move on
to the next life?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.243 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Very good question.

00:13:32.243 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
You know when you
settle the karmic debt

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
when you don't
repeat the pattern.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Just like, think of
it as-- I'll give you

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:90%
an analogy you maybe relate to.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
financial debt to somebody,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and somebody keeps calling
you and sending you

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
emails and knocking
on your door.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
When you pay your bills,
no more calls, no more

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:90%
emails, no more door knocking.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Same thing applies here.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't repeat the cycle.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The pattern ends
and you move on.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Remember though, as you
learn your karmic lessons,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
the lessons get easier
as you go along.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:90%
You build up a foundation.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like the immune
system of your body.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
As you eat better and
get plenty of rest,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.932 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to resist the
viruses and the bacteria

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.654 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you do get
better as you progress.

00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: If, no,
you have free will.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:90%
You can also--

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, you
do have free will.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.673 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: You have free will.

00:14:16.673 --> 00:14:18.144 align:middle line:90%
And you can simply just keep on.

00:14:18.144 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Look, the Ivy case, in
"The Search for Grace,"

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.886 align:middle line:90%
46 past lives.

00:14:20.886 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
20 of them, she was
murdered by the same guy.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
It would have been number 21.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So she wasn't getting it.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have the right to
just say, nah, not this time.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does there ever
get to be a point, Bruce,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:90%
where you stop reincarnating?

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Where you just reach
that level of perfection,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
you don't come back anymore?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah, we
call that ascension.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.906 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is, you have
to wipe out the karmic debts.

00:14:40.906 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%
They have to be zero.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.032 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have
to perfect the soul.

00:14:44.032 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you're actually
doing, think of it this way.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this is your
subconscious mind.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Low energy.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:90%
This is your higher self.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.515 align:middle line:84%
You want to merge
with your higher self.

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you do so, you become
one, at onement, atonement,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.355 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you're now perfect,

00:14:58.355 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
more karmic cycle.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You can either stay on as a
spirit guide, like a Buddha,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
or you can rejoin what we
call the God energy complex,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.814 align:middle line:84%
and there's no more body,
there's no more reincarnation.

00:15:08.814 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
You're simply in the
eternal now, the nirvana,

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
heaven, whatever
term you want to use.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.755 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The fact that we would
even be talking about it right

00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
now, does that mean everybody
here is getting a little more

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.777 align:middle line:84%
advanced, in terms
of perfection?

00:15:20.777 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, they're
learning more about it.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But see, this is not
cognitive therapy.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:90%
You have to raise the energy.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:90%
So learning about it is fine.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
learn about things,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.887 align:middle line:84%
but they still make
the same mistakes.

00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do it.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.344 align:middle line:90%
It's action.

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Not just
academic knowledge.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.866 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to have
the knowledge, you've

00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:90%
got to know what you're doing.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Like having a treatment plan.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a step.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: That's a step.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got
to actually do it.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
When the doctor diagnoses
a person, that's fine.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.704 align:middle line:84%
But then they got to treat the
person, not just diagnose them,

00:15:46.704 --> 00:15:47.545 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:15:47.545 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Another question?

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes, sir.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Relative to the last
gentleman's question,

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.986 align:middle line:84%
and this really
august discussion,

00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm enjoying it, are
you familiar with the works

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.379 align:middle line:90%
of Manly P Hall?

00:15:58.379 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, of course.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.935 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Philosophical
researcher in Los Angeles who

00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
wrote books in the
early 1900s, sometime.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Certainly.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.202 align:middle line:84%
Well, short of these
satiric and all

00:16:05.202 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of the other things, that it was
sacred symbolism and so forth,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I would recall one
particular work he did,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
the lecture series.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is, the past
lives, present problems,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.156 align:middle line:90%
and unfinished business.

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And you sound like
you're echoing

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.614 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that instruction.

00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:20.904 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, he was a
brilliant man and way ahead

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
of his time.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.065 align:middle line:90%
And his works are brilliant.

00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:90%
They're still around.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course you can get
them in libraries.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:90%
But he was ancient Egypt.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.185 align:middle line:84%
He dealt with everything,
Masonic mentality.

00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:90%
A brilliant man.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I would highly recommend him.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
His writings are not always easy
for the average person to read,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.864 align:middle line:90%
But he's brilliant.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And his works are
well illustrated

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.155 align:middle line:90%
and very interesting.

00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:43.488 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: His icon work
is the secret teaching of all

00:16:43.488 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:90%
ages, as well.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you, sir.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.613 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
How difficult is it
for people to advance

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:90%
in these stages, Bruce?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's not as
difficult as it may sound.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
open-minded, in other words,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.204 align:middle line:84%
if you're motivated to attain a
goal, then anything can happen.

00:17:03.204 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Our higher
self, you have to understand,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
the higher self comes from
the God energy complex.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect and it's creative.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:90%
So you can do anything.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
When I talk with you on the
radio about cases of cancer

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and AIDS that we talk--
I don't cure people.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:90%
The patient cures themselves.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm the trainer.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm 1%, they're 99%.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So if they're motivated, then,
again, all they have to do

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is use techniques, have
a positive attitude, yes,

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:90%
but then anything is possible.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.876 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you just mentioned
that, the positive attitude.

00:17:30.876 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many
people say you

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
have to have that
to really get going.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:90%
But how critical is that?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
What if somebody goes
in with negativity?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to better myself.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to heal myself.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, those people
don't call me, number one.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
But let me give you an example.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
A woman calls me
up and says, I want

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.955 align:middle line:84%
you to help my
husband stop smoking.

00:17:46.955 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm speaking
to the wrong person.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And she's calling you.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.388 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm speaking
to the wrong person,

00:17:51.388 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
where's the hubby?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And she says,
well, I'm his wife.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
really care about that.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:84%
If your husband isn't
motivated, you're

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
going to waste my
time and your money.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to do this.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I want to speak to him.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.299 align:middle line:84%
If he's motivated,
put him on the phone.

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to speak with him.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She's motivated.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes, she is.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Of course, she is.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And she has a right to
want him to stop smoking.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But if he's trying to patronize
her, or if he's saying,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
yes dear, then it's
not going to work.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's not
going to work at all.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
With this energy healing that
you've worked on with people,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
when you also
hypnotherapy them back,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and you pick up these
events in their lives,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.999 align:middle line:84%
how quickly do they
cure themselves?

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It depends
on the person, obviously.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
A case of cancer, AIDS, or
massive major depression

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
disorder is not
going to be, quote,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:90%
cured in a matter of a few days.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.181 align:middle line:84%
Stage fright, smoking, nail
biting, things like that,

00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:90%
are usually pretty easy.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.763 align:middle line:84%
But everybody is
different because you

00:18:44.763 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
have to see how
necessary was that habit

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.825 align:middle line:90%
or issue to their personality.

00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
If they're
comfortable with that,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.533 align:middle line:84%
and people do learn to be
comfortable with dysfunctional

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:84%
behaviors, then it's
going to take longer.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, let's
define some terms.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Going back in time, we
call that regression.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Past life regression, past life.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Going forward
in time is progression.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Progression.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.651 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Future
life progression,

00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:90%
or age progression in this life.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Going into parallel universes
is called paragression.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Sliding, you might
say, going back into,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
or not going back, going
the same time era, just

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
at a different universe.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we in all these
other universes, right now?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes, the
multi-verse mentality is

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:90%
actually documented by science.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Everett III, in
Princeton University, 1957,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
documented the idea
of parallel universes.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And ever since
then, you know, it's

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
been on every "Twilight Zone"
episode and every feature film

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:90%
in metaphysics.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So we do have
parallel universes.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.136 align:middle line:84%
And we can discuss
some cases of that

00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
as we go along here, if
you want, to show you

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
that people do have
parallel lives.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bruce, mention your
website for people, would you?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's a d-r, d
as in David, r as in Robert,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.676 align:middle line:90%
brucegoldberg.com.

00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
G-o-l-d-b-e-r-g dot com.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And on the site, there are
many videos of actual cases

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:90%
that we talk about.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:90%
There are articles.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And all my books,
speaking engagements,

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
everything is on there.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Super.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into a
parallel universes in just

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.786 align:middle line:84%
a moment on "Beyond Belief"
with Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:20:07.786 --> 00:20:10.544 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with
Dr. Bruce Goldberg,

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about reincarnation,
time travel, teleportation,

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
energy healing, and
parallel universes.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And time
travelers from our future.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.774 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You got it.

00:20:24.774 --> 00:20:27.322 align:middle line:90%
But what is a parallel universe?

00:20:27.322 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, think
of our universe today,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.435 align:middle line:84%
with all the billions of planets
and suns the stars and black

00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:84%
holes that consists of our
universe, the Milky Way,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Well science has shown
that there are parallel

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:90%
universes, identical universes.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You and me are there, same
DNA, except the only difference

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.030 align:middle line:90%
is the actions are different.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You might
be interviewing me.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I may be the hypnotherapist.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Or you could
be some person whose wife is

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:90%
trying to have him stop smoking.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You never know.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So in other
words, you could die,

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.070 align:middle line:90%
in a parallel universe.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It has no effect on you now.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in parallel
universes, for example,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've done hundreds of these,
there are parallel universes

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
where the British won of the
American Revolutionary War,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
where Hitler won World War
II and he developed the bomb,

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:84%
where the comet hit the
Earth that Nostradamus

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
predicted in 1999.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.942 align:middle line:84%
These kinds, where RFK survived
and became President in 1968.

00:21:19.942 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
always events, though,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that echo these events that
we've been going through?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Or are there some that
are totally different?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say,
there's a World War III

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't had yet.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Might it already be going
on in the other universe?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.157 align:middle line:90%
Or is it always chronological?

00:21:39.157 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: No,
I'll give an example.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:90%
The answer is actually both.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, some of the
events that we have today

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.484 align:middle line:84%
will have different endings
in the parallel universe.

00:21:46.484 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:90%
But here's an example.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I did a research project.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.213 align:middle line:84%
I didn't publish
this because I didn't

00:21:50.213 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
want to cater to the
audience, or might

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
say, sabotage my
techniques, here.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
In 1988, I did progressions
to the end of the century.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Now that was--

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a long way out.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.958 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: A long
way out, right?

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was, in, it
was actually January of '88

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%
when I did the research.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
In May of 1988, there was a
nuclear war, World War III.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.101 align:middle line:84%
Soviet Union, US-- the
whole world was involved.

00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Did you read about
it in the papers?

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, sir.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Parallel universe.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aha!

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So in the
parallel universe--

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So it does happen.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: It does happen.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
is science,

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is for your
audience, the August,

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.804 align:middle line:84%
2000 issue of "Scientific
American" details

00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
parallel universe,
gives you the update.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Very, very, very
well done article.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And they show that the
closest sister universe to us

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:90%
is less than a millimeter away.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:90%
That's 1/40 of an inch.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
That's how much they overlap.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.212 align:middle line:90%
But they don't affect us.

00:22:40.212 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a nuclear
war in the sister universe,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:90%
it has nothing to do with us.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.309 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When some people see
shadow people, or entities --

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Lower astral
entities, we call them,

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:90%
most times.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Might they be coming
over from these parallel

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%
universes?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
That's actually one of
the explanations, yes.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.642 align:middle line:84%
Also Jacques Vallee wrote
about it, the ETs traveling

00:23:01.642 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
through the universe
and says that.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Its his main mentality
about how they come here.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
The gatekeepers, the Pleiadians
are all called gatekeepers.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
They can travel
from one paralytic--

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
they monitor the
universes, where they,

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
entities, coming through.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course,
you can have that.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea of parallel
universes, and going,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
almost like a
"Stargate" mentality,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
is how you can get the Zeta
Riticuli, the greys from Zeta

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Riticuli, coming to the
earth 25 light years away

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:90%
in a matter of minutes or hours.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So that -- this is
actually backed by --

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:84%
geophysics and quantum
physics will support this.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So yes, parallel
universes are real.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Traveling through them
is how the time travelers

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
from our future,
as we'll discuss,

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that's how they travel
to our time zone.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many parallel
universes can there be?

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Infinite number.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.301 align:middle line:84%
Technically, every
time-- this is

00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
why scientists don't
like quantum physics.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics
is a real science.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:90%
It's got the math.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.759 align:middle line:90%
If you got the math, it works.

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have
a thought, you're

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
creating a parallel universe.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
thought of your traveling

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.972 align:middle line:84%
in an invisible plane,
like Wonder Woman, OK?

00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
You now just created
a parallel universe.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not likely
to occur now, here,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
but you've now created
a universe, where

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
all the stars, all the
planets, everything

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:90%
exists in any scenario.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So, technically,
that's what happens

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:90%
every time you have a thought.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So parallel universes
are infinite.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, that we only
are exposed to one at a time.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
If you were getting information
about eight things happening

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
at one time, the therapist would
call you schizophrenic, OK?

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
What I feel, and it's not
me, it's also Fred Alan Wolf

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and other quantum
physicists will state,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.596 align:middle line:84%
is that, what you're
getting is actually

00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
information from
parallel universes.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is amazing.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Because I've worked
with people who've gotten that,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and got them off
that without drugs.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Future time travel,
progression, as you call it,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.935 align:middle line:84%
how far out now do
you take people?

00:24:50.935 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: 50th century.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 50th century?

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.457 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes, 5000 AD.

00:24:54.457 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So we're still around?

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Still
around, 5000 AD.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.531 align:middle line:84%
After that, it looks like we
tend to leave this planet.

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the 50th century,
between the 31st century

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and the 50th century,
that's when time travel

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
will be discovered by
a man named Tattose

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
in the year,
approximately, 3050.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.004 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is he around now?

00:25:12.004 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, no.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:90%
He's actually ascended now.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
He's as high as you can get.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.185 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Had his reign.

00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But he was reported, he
went back, all the way

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to ancient Egypt.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
He was known as Hermes,
or Tattose, or Thoth

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient Egyptians.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
We called him Hermes.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And he had a team, the first
time traveler team from,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:90%
the 31st century.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the names.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Geb, Horace, Isis, and Osiris.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Ring a bell?

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, they sure do.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Egyptian gods.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.996 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ancient Egyptians.

00:25:39.996 --> 00:25:42.645 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So what I'm saying
is that the time travel is

00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:44.907 align:middle line:84%
real, but not for
another 1,000 years.

00:25:44.907 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they
come back in time,

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
so reality, our civilization
has been custom designed

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
by people from our
future, you see?

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they came back
into ancient Egypt.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.804 align:middle line:90%
They were in Sumeria.

00:25:53.804 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:90%
They were in China and India.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:90%
They were all over the place.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.982 align:middle line:84%
And they have given
us our technology.

00:25:59.982 --> 00:26:02.315 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, when
you see spurts in technology,

00:26:02.315 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
you know what you normally
see, for the last 100 years

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:90%
at least?

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
ET observations.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.484 align:middle line:84%
1895, 1896, there
were ETs, UFOs,

00:26:10.484 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they didn't called
them UFOs then,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
but they were like cigar-shaped
crafts and others--

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've read the
stories-- in many cities

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you had Kitty Hawk,

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:90%
1903, the Wright brothers.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.519 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the
Roswell, et cetera.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at the computer age.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And the nukes.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: And '73 in DC.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
You had the observations
in other times.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have major
spikes in our technology,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
you can correlate that with ET,
UFO observations, et cetera.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we've
been interacted

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:90%
by two major sources.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.500 align:middle line:90%
One is the ETs of course.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:84%
Especially the Pleiadians
and greys, the Zeta Reticuli.

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the time
travelers from our future.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.211 align:middle line:84%
So the time travelers are
here for our spiritual growth.

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do they
describe our future?

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.496 align:middle line:84%
What do things look like
in the 50th century?

00:26:57.496 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
this is interesting.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
There's now Tattose is the
man who developed time travel.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
He has ascended, so
he's not around anymore.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But to memorialize him,
there's a amusement park

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:90%
called the Land of Tattose.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
It floats about the 3000
feet above the ground.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And people can go there.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.778 align:middle line:84%
And what they go
there-- they don't

00:27:17.778 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
have rides-- they go into the
Renaissance for the weekend.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.174 align:middle line:90%
They do time travel.

00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So people don't
fall off the edge.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
They have like a force
field around them,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
because some people get
a little crazy, right?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Then there's another device that
I called the Mindwich Machine.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.125 align:middle line:84%
It's a simulator,
a food simulator.

00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
You think about of the
proverbial chicken sandwich,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like a
microwave, your thoughts

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
create the actual
chicken sandwich.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And there it is.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.576 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: You can eat it.

00:27:38.576 --> 00:27:39.659 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly nutritious.

00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't gain weight.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
Mindwich Machine.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No food shortages
in the future, huh?

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: None at all.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a fun thing that's

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:90%
called the alphasyncolarium.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a --
like an isolation tank.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They inject, or not inject,
but they present various sounds

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and energy through the body,
which stimulates the DHEA

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
production by the adrenal
glands and gonads.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, it
lengthens the life processes.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
By the 50th century,
actually by the 35th century,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
the average lifespan
is going to be

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.975 align:middle line:90%
between 500 and 900 years young.

00:28:10.975 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Almost like the
old biblical days.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back in a moment on
"Beyond Belief" with Dr. Bruce

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Goldberg.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.248 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:28:19.248 --> 00:28:21.064 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:21.064 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Facinating.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
of "Beyond Belief"

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, the topic of
parallel universes, Bruce,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
just fascinates
me, that things are

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
going on in tandem with
what we're doing right now.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just
absolutely riveting.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.164 align:middle line:84%
How did science decide
these things exist?

00:28:41.164 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, Einstein's
Theory of Relativity gave us

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:90%
parallel universes, initially.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:84%
He didn't like it from
the math because he

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:90%
was very conservative about it.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.255 align:middle line:84%
But then Hugh Everett
III, of course, in '57,

00:28:52.255 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:84%
studied at Princeton,
where, of course,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Einstein taught
there for 30 years.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So Hugh Everett III's
parallel multi-dimensional or

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
multi-verse mentality
became hard science.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.772 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting,
and parallel universes

00:29:04.772 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:84%
are one thing, but
there's something else

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:90%
that's even more fun.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And what's there?

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: This is
called parallel selves.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.177 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Parallel selves?

00:29:11.177 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Selves.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Now selves, s-e-l-v-e-s.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Selves, OK.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.713 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Let me separate it.

00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:19.770 align:middle line:84%
A parallel life deals with the
same DNA in a sister universe,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.968 align:middle line:90%
A completely separate universe.

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:23.843 align:middle line:84%
Actions are different,
but you look the same.

00:29:23.843 --> 00:29:24.342 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
A parallel self is
different, where

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul, which is energy,
can occupy different bodies

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
of different DNA, you can be
male, female, different races,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.007 align:middle line:90%
whatever in the same universe.

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:90%
So let me give an example.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.512 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:29:38.512 --> 00:29:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: A man named
Charles, he's very academic,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
he's about 5 foot, 8, wears
glasses, very low speaking,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:84%
very type B
personality, low key.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
He wants to explore
various lives, et cetera.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, we come up with
a man named Winchester

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
who exists at the same time, OK?

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.314 align:middle line:84%
It's the soul occupying
a different male body.

00:29:57.314 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.646 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:29:58.646 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Different DNA.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Winchester is a big lumberjack
looking guy, red hair,

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.325 align:middle line:84%
he's about 6 foot, 3, you
know, wears plaid a lot.

00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:06.966 align:middle line:90%
Good old boy.

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Totally opposite.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.381 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Complete opposite.

00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:12.594 align:middle line:84%
So Charles never discusses
Winchester with anyone.

00:30:12.594 --> 00:30:14.635 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's embarrassed
by it because he almost

00:30:14.635 --> 00:30:15.386 align:middle line:90%
is offended by it.

00:30:15.386 --> 00:30:17.636 align:middle line:84%
Because he's very academic
and this is like, you know,

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:90%
it's Homer Simpson here.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So a couple weeks later,
his cousin on the West Coast

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is driving her car
and stuck on the road

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and she's in the middle
of nowhere, in the desert.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not safe.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
it's the daytime.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But a man comes up with
a pickup truck, OK?

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Stops by and says,
ma'am can I help ya?

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And she says, yes,
I'm stuck here.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Fixes the car.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
He's got red hair, he's about
6 foot, 3, wearing plaid.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.967 align:middle line:84%
And she says, thank
you, very much.

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Can I ask you what your name is?

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.545 align:middle line:90%
He goes, my name is Winchester.

00:30:49.545 --> 00:30:50.503 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There you go.

00:30:50.503 --> 00:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Now it gets
even more significant.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:90%
She felt she knew him.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.514 align:middle line:90%
She never met him before.

00:30:56.514 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Charles didn't
tell her about him.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:84%
But she felt that she knew
him as she new Charles.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
That was Charles's
parallel self,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
in the same universe,
same time frame.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When she mentioned
this, and he heard it,

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:90%
did he go nuts?

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
Charles, of course,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:90%
this was a confirmation.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But the cousin,
you understand, she

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.246 align:middle line:84%
wasn't privy to
the paragression.

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:84%
We call this a
paragression, now.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She didn't know that.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So she was a little
freaked out at first.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.765 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I can't
believe this, you know?

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:29.579 align:middle line:84%
But of course, and
she spoke with me.

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
She wanted me to confirm
that because she thought

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Charles was kind of kidding her.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.789 align:middle line:84%
And then I honestly
said, no, Charles

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:90%
is telling you the truth.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I did the-- it's
called a paragression.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:84%
This not a regression,
it's not a progression,

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:90%
it's a paragression.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.629 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, OK, but
it's really kind of weird.

00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you were
on "Coast to Coast"

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
you had an astronomical
response to your self-healing.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
How people are able to do
this by going back into time,

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
being regressed, working on
their ills and fixing them.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you think all
of us need that?

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:90%
We all need to be fixed?

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.516 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: I'll tell
you what we don't need.

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The average American ingests
76,000 pills in their lifetime.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.697 align:middle line:90%
That's what we don't--

00:32:11.697 --> 00:32:12.405 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 76,000?

00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: 76,000.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what we don't need.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.444 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:15.444 --> 00:32:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And I also had mentioned
that the Office

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
of Alternative Medicine,
a division of the National

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Health,
in Bethesda, Maryland,

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.001 align:middle line:84%
which is where the President,
senators, and the Supreme Court

00:32:24.001 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
justices get their physicals
and their health care, the most

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.070 align:middle line:84%
well-respected medical
institution in the world, they

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
formulated the OAM, the
Office of Alternative

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Medicine in 1992.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And they spend millions
of dollars a year

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:90%
investigating what?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.232 align:middle line:84%
Past life therapy,
hypnotherapy, shamanic medicine,

00:32:40.232 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Tibetan medicine.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They would never
tell us publicly, would they?

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
they can go online.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.774 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can you find it?

00:32:45.774 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: NIH, or Office
of Alternative Medicine,

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:90%
and they'll give you the list.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
There's about 30
different specialties.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why did they
decide to do that?

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Because the
psychiatrist involved said,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:90%
you know something?

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.236 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism works,
our stuff doesn't.

00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So we want
to know why shamanism,

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and energy approach, Reiki
healing, all the acupuncture,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
all the energy approaches,
why does that work?

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.192 align:middle line:90%
And why does our stuff not work?

00:33:07.192 --> 00:33:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they're studying it.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bruce, what
does this tell you?

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation, energy
healing, parallel universes,

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:84%
parallel selves, what
does all this tell you

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.362 align:middle line:84%
about what all of this
is and how it works?

00:33:22.362 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well,
what it says is,

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
the universe is much more
complicated than we think.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Shakespeare
said it best about Horatio.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
There are more things in heaven
and earth than-- you know.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But it just shows you that the
universe is based upon energy.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
13.7 billion years ago,
there was a big bang.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
That's absolute scientific fact.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Nobody argues that.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Which came first,
energy or matter?

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.679 align:middle line:90%
E equals MC squared, right?

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So energy can be converted
to matter, matter to energy.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Which do you think came first?

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't know.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the puzzle.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Energy,
by 500 million years.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So if God, in his
infinite wisdom,

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
decided to have
energy come first,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.107 align:middle line:84%
my priority is energy,
the soul's energy.

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:84%
More important than
the physical body.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.314 align:middle line:84%
Yes, take care of
you body, believe me.

00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm real big on that.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.693 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: But the soul
is what I'm dealing with

00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:84%
because the energy of the
soul will control the quality

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.679 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body's lives.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.704 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
like to soul doctor.

00:34:16.704 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, soul healing
is what I like to call it.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also Dr.
Positive, too, remember.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about children?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.225 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: What about them?

00:34:23.225 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do you deal with them?

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: I deal with
children as young as four.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is, children, you know,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the late Ian
Stevenson's research,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've done some of
this too, when children

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
speak like foreign
languages in trances

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
it's called xenoglossy, that
they have no awareness of.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:84%
That's more of the suggestive
evidence of reincarnation.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But when children
speak with a vocabulary

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
far beyond their level,
when they're talking about,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
well, I had this
mistress in the city when

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.385 align:middle line:90%
I was a big CEO of this company.

00:34:49.385 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the kid's
four years old.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
do that, don't they?

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it does happen.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Oh, it does happen.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They talk
about stuff like that.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Those
are relatively rare,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:84%
but those are deep level,
what we call somnambulistic

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:90%
patients.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
information from children,

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:84%
it's much more
impressive because they

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.301 align:middle line:84%
don't have the same
possibility of getting research

00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:90%
done that an adult would have.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.251 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: More importantly,
my interest is not that.

00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:13.937 align:middle line:84%
My interest is whatever the
issue is, let's resolve it.

00:35:13.937 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I love working with
children because they're

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.035 align:middle line:84%
going to have a much better
life than their parents.

00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Because
their parents,

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:90%
they've had their things.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I work with the parents, too.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:21.875 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
more receptive?

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Very receptive.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Children, in fact, the ideal
age for hypnosis by the Medical

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.141 align:middle line:84%
Association, because
I was trained by them,

00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is between eight and 16 because
they're very suggestible.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Anybody who has
teenage children can tell you

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:90%
that, right?

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And children in that age
range, very suggestible,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.737 align:middle line:84%
and they will work
with authority figures.

00:35:37.737 --> 00:35:40.195 align:middle line:84%
When they get beyond that, they
tend to be more rebellious,

00:35:40.195 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little harder
to work with them.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you
hypnotize someone,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:84%
can you make them do something
that they truly don't want

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:90%
to do?

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.894 align:middle line:84%
As matter of fact, Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore,

00:35:51.894 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and many other
universities have shown,

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
like people hate
their mother-in-law,

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and they give them,
like, a knife.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And they say, this is an
image of you mother-in-law.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.108 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a somnambulistic
trance, where they'll

00:36:00.108 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
assume that the dummy in front
of them is their mother-in-law,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:90%
they don't stab them.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.355 align:middle line:84%
Now a homicidal maniac
will do that, of course.

00:36:06.355 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.396 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: But you can't
convince anybody to do anything

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:11.210 align:middle line:84%
against their
moral, ethical code.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
seducing women.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.322 align:middle line:84%
That includes having
somebody eat pork

00:36:16.322 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:84%
if they don't, if they're
an orthodox Jew, or Muslim,

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:90%
or et cetera.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.015 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:36:20.015 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:90%
That will not happen.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:90%
So they're perfectly safe.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember hypnosis is it
daydream state that's natural.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Driving on the freeway,
not remembering

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
all the exits you go by,
playing with your computer,

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
baking cookies, reading
a book, listening

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to music, anything that relaxes
you, where time goes by quickly

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and you don't realize
moment to moment,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that's a hypnotic
level naturally.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It's an alpha
brainwave, medically.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.031 align:middle line:84%
And we do this for four hours
during the waking day, 5 and 10

00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:90%
minutes, here and there.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And three hours at night during
the REM cycle, the dream cycle.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So every 24 hours,
the average individual

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
out there, you and I and
everybody else, seven hours

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:84%
a day, almost one third of
your life is spent in hypnosis.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's natural.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.650 align:middle line:84%
The American Medical
Association accepted hypnosis

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.960 align:middle line:90%
as a therapeutic realm in 1958.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
accepted it since then.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's perfectly safe.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But if somebody
is predisposed to doing

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:13.500 align:middle line:84%
something-- let's say, somebody
really doesn't mind killing

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
someone-- can that person
be programmed to assassinate

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
somebody, to do something
heinous like that?

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, if they're
a natural murderer anyway,

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.980 align:middle line:84%
you had, remember, the MK Ultra
Project in Canada from the CIA

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:90%
back in the '50s.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.496 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:37:26.496 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: The Manchurian
Candidate mentality.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about brainwashing.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
brainwash somebody,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis alone is
not going to work.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It will not?

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.568 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: What you have to
do is, you have to use drugs,

00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:39.197 align:middle line:84%
sodium pentothal or amitol,
or others or hallucinogenics.

00:37:39.197 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And you've got do
sensory deprivation.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: To plant the seed?

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah,
you've got it.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to keep them
up for like three weeks.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.635 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No sleep, OK?

00:37:45.635 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Then
they'll accept anything.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But again, as far as
the average person,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:84%
again, if a person is
conditioned to murder people

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:84%
anyway, if they're a gang
banger from the inner city

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and they like to kill people
because they are a drug dealer

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it
doesn't take much.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
You can just say 41st
and Elm, kill 'em.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to do it.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.383 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And here's some money.

00:38:03.383 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah,
that would help.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:06.248 align:middle line:90%
But you can't convince.

00:38:06.248 --> 00:38:07.380 align:middle line:90%
The point is not that.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:84%
The person who wouldn't
normally kill someone,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:84%
but they hate
someone, or somebody

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.417 align:middle line:84%
did something very negative
to them, they won't kill them.

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know,
when you see these stage shows

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and the hypnotist will
have these people come up

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and he'll say to them,
while they're hypnotized,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:27.310 align:middle line:84%
you have no clothes on,
and they're all, you know,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:90%
shivering and hiding themselves.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Do they actually believe
they don't have clothes on?

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand,
the stage hypnotist, first

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of all, he's giving
you an impression

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:90%
that he controls the person.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.714 align:middle line:84%
It's the complete
opposite of reality.

00:38:37.714 --> 00:38:38.671 align:middle line:90%
They're an entertainer.

00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:40.514 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the people
coming up on the stage,

00:38:40.514 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:90%
they're all somnambulistics.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.924 align:middle line:90%
See he does pretesting.

00:38:42.924 --> 00:38:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The average person will not
be allowed on the stage.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be a somnambual,
very deep level subject.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.963 align:middle line:84%
And then those people
want to perform.

00:38:48.963 --> 00:38:50.321 align:middle line:90%
Why are they going on the stage?

00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They know he's going to
make a fool out of them.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got to bark
like a dog, or whatever

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:90%
they're going to do.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're
going to be telling you

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.827 align:middle line:90%
how great you look.

00:38:56.827 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, they don't care.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So you have to
understand the psychodynamics

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.481 align:middle line:90%
of the individual chosen.

00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:02.272 align:middle line:84%
So stage hypnotism is
not a good example.

00:39:02.272 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:90%
By the way, it scares people.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It keeps people away
from therapists like me

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
because everybody thinks that
if you come to the office--

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's what you do.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.506 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: --you're
going to do that, right.

00:39:09.506 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:90%
But let's go back to this.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis, by the way, is all
an out of body experience.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I use the term IBE,
in other words,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:90%
an in the body experience.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
in hypnosis, you

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
can now use your astral
senses, your fifth

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
dimensional senses, not
just your physical one.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.715 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
past life information.

00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Past life information
is not your typical day

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.080 align:middle line:90%
to day routine.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.344 align:middle line:84%
The average person doesn't
say, oh yes, Egypt, 1312 BC.

00:39:34.344 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It doesn't happen.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.843 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: They don't do that.

00:39:36.843 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But if they're in hypnosis, not
under, in, it's a waking state,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
then they can access
their akashic records.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how I got the
Dexter Monterrey and Zeor

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:90%
life with you.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But you're using now the fifth
dimensional mentality, you see?

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand, we live
in a five dimensional universe.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
We only see three dimensions, or
hear with our physical senses.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Time is the fourth dimension.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Anything beyond time, the astral
plane, parallel universes,

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.155 align:middle line:84%
all these other
dimensions represent

00:40:05.155 --> 00:40:06.530 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
fifth dimension.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
more questions for you, Dr.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Goldberg.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Who hasn't had a question yet?

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.917 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:40:11.917 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You do help people
with the past life regressions

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and help them get over the
bad patterns that they form.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:84%
When you do a future
life progression,

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
say George wakes
up tomorrow morning

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and decides he doesn't want
to be his 22nd century self,

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is there anything he
can do in this life

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.162 align:middle line:84%
with his karmic
energy to change that?

00:40:27.162 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: That 22nd century
life is Dexter Monterrey.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a rather positive one.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd rather be
foolish to deny that.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's say it
was a negative one.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we did
another progression

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in a parallel universe,
where he was a mass murderer.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.769 align:middle line:84%
A different kind of
Dexter like in Showtime.

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, another Dexter.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a parallel
universe, don't select it.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:84%
There are parallel
universes where you at I

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else are
having great lives.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And in other ones, they're
in the proverbial toilet.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about a future.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:54.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I said.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, what if
it's very negative?

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.670 align:middle line:90%
That's an option.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.120 align:middle line:90%
We'll go on to the next one.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have-- here's a
good example, years ago I did,

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:84%
in 1996 I did an age
progression on a woman.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It was early June.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.145 align:middle line:84%
She was going to go to Paris
the next month, graduated

00:41:10.145 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:84%
from college, she was
going to go for the summer

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.304 align:middle line:84%
and then come back and
go to graduate school.

00:41:14.304 --> 00:41:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Her name, I call her
Tammy, not her real name.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And she does that.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.664 align:middle line:84%
And she goes through
these experiences

00:41:21.664 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
where she seeing the
events, while she's

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
in my office for the next
few days, that had come true.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:90%
So she's got a good record.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:90%
They're accurate.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.225 align:middle line:84%
She goes home and about three
weeks later, 1996 now, she

00:41:31.225 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
calls me up, she goes,
Doctor, this is Tammy.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I've got an emergency.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.594 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Tammy, I
retired from dentistry

00:41:37.594 --> 00:41:38.510 align:middle line:90%
to get away from that.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I did your techniques,
and I see myself going up

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:84%
in my plane to go to Paris from
New York, from New York City.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And the plane goes
up, crashes, I die.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.610 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said look, I don't
want to run your life.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.028 align:middle line:84%
Change your flight plans, call
me at the end of the summer.

00:41:54.028 --> 00:41:56.330 align:middle line:84%
She was going to go
one TWA flight 800.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: July 17, 1996,
plane leaves JFK, goes up,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:84%
crashes, 230 people all died,
all crew, all passengers.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:84%
She would have
died, but she didn't

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:84%
because he saw the
future and changed it.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call this
psychic empowerment.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So people do have
the right, with the free will,

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.587 align:middle line:90%
to alter their future.

00:42:17.587 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Free will
what works both ways.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-edged sword.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.880 align:middle line:90%
You can do great things.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
You can do dumb things.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who is next?

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Question for Dr. Bruce Goldberg?

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Can you
address, in some way,

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know I call
them soul groups,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.380 align:middle line:84%
groups of people who kind of
float in and off the planet

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
relatively at the same time.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: You talking
about in your own life,

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:84%
people you've known before,
that come back as a karmic

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:90%
relationship?

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.166 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:44.624 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: For
good or ill, yes.

00:42:44.624 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.040 align:middle line:84%
This we call the
Rule of 12 here.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.885 align:middle line:84%
Every dozen lives
or so, you're going

00:42:49.885 --> 00:42:51.621 align:middle line:84%
to have the same
people in your life.

00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:52.995 align:middle line:84%
These are emotional
relationships

00:42:52.995 --> 00:42:54.070 align:middle line:90%
that are significant.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Not somebody you see
on the subway, OK?

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.670 align:middle line:84%
These are people who are your
family, friends, coworkers,

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or people who have extreme
relationships with you.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they've done
bad things with you,

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and you left that,
that's victimization,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.826 align:middle line:84%
and you don't stop
it it's going to keep

00:43:06.826 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:84%
on happening with that person or
somebody else, same principle.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have those
relationships with them,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.958 align:middle line:84%
and the good ones too,
the one's that are

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
soul mates or positive
people in your life.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.812 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to deal with
them for about a dozen lives,

00:43:19.812 --> 00:43:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you've going to
go on to another cycle

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.645 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going
to be with you anymore.

00:43:23.645 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
when you're with them,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
when you have you
interactions with them,

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
you want them to be positive,
you want to protect yourself

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:84%
from victimization if that's an
issue, and you want to move on.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you have to end
that relationship with them

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.231 align:middle line:90%
because they're not getting it.

00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that you have--

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to do that,
especially if it's family.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.487 align:middle line:90%
But you know something?

00:43:44.487 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Blood is not thicker than water.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.467 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's being an energy
vampire, as we call them,

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:90%
you have to confront them.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you're
failing the karmic test.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bruce, how do these
souls seem to migrate to each

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:84%
other in these
past lives, where--

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're
absolutely correct,

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
we do migrate to certain groups
of people in these lives.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.657 align:middle line:90%
But how does that happen?

00:44:04.657 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Remember, the
universe was created by a God

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:90%
energy complex.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.680 align:middle line:84%
We didn't create this from
a spontaneous generation

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:84%
of life, which has never been
demonstrated in science, OK?

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So the God energy complex,
the spirit guides, the angels,

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:84%
whatever entities you want,
these are perfect entities.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
They created this system for us.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.434 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like you
have a syllabus in school.

00:44:23.434 --> 00:44:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You're taking a college
course, very detailed,

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:26.530 align:middle line:90%
technical course.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Somebody created a
syllabus, some professor.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Not to fail every one, but
if you do your homework,

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:84%
you study, you pay attention,
and you do what you have to do,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.352 align:middle line:90%
you pass, you matriculate.

00:44:37.352 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is
created that way, too.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We have karmic
tests and lessons.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow the
rules, have a good mindset,

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:84%
do unto others-- you know, it's
not just a Christian principle,

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a metaphysical principle
that predates Christianity

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
by thousands of years--
the energy you send out

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.406 align:middle line:90%
is what you get.

00:44:52.406 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
law of attraction.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's also based
upon learning lessons.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.657 align:middle line:84%
So this is the idea of what
I call psychic empowerment.

00:44:59.657 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you want
to do is protect yourself

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.330 align:middle line:84%
from victimization,
and then move on.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.134 align:middle line:84%
If that person doesn't get
it, get them out of your life

00:45:07.134 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because you're
never going to win.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.720 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back for more
on "Beyond Belief" in just

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.834 align:middle line:90%
a moment.

00:45:12.834 --> 00:45:16.564 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:16.564 --> 00:45:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with
Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And, Bruce, before we ask
somebody in our audience

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to volunteer for one of
your past life regressions,

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
tell us what that is
and how you do it.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.859 align:middle line:90%
Explain the process.

00:45:30.859 --> 00:45:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Past life
regression is simply using

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis, the natural daydream,
to ask the patient to go back

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.890 align:middle line:84%
in time to the origin of a
problem or to attain whatever

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:90%
goal they want to attain.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Like doing a computer research.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a Google.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And
what we're using is,

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.920 align:middle line:84%
the higher self is going to read
the patient's account Akashic

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:84%
records and then point
out a particular life.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going to
be a question and answer.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I ask them the question,
they give me response.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Their response leads
me to my next question.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.395 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you know what
their personal problem is?

00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Do they come and tell you that?

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you get that out
of interviewing them?

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.515 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Oh, yes.

00:46:06.515 --> 00:46:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
read their mind.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the mentalist, here.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.070 align:middle line:90%
No, they tell me.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.694 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, like,
look, I want to know

00:46:12.694 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the origin of,
let's say, my height

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.754 align:middle line:84%
phobia, of my acrophobia,
fear of heights.

00:46:17.754 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Or
spiders, arachnophobia.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.723 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: They tell me that.

00:46:21.723 --> 00:46:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, well
let's go back in time

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.709 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to ask your
subconscious mind, simply.

00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say go back
to ancient Egypt, or Rome,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.770 align:middle line:90%
or Sumeria, or whatever.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply going to
say, go to the origin,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:84%
or go back in time, or
whatever, to the origin

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.900 align:middle line:90%
of that particular issue.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That moment.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Then
they will tell me,

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:84%
whatever the time period is,
and whatever the scenario is.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I hate
clowns, for example.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
hypnotize me, would we

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.494 align:middle line:84%
find some kind of heinous thing
that happened with clowns?

00:46:47.494 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, you could
have been traumatically

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:49.820 align:middle line:90%
affected.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't trust them.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.044 align:middle line:84%
They've got their
sharp little teeth.

00:46:53.044 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: A lot of people
have issues with clowns

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost like
the equivalent of taking

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:84%
a 6-year-old to the original
"Jurassic Park" movie,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.645 align:middle line:84%
when it was very violent, and
dinosaurs were killing people.

00:47:03.645 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Not a good concept.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, maybe I was
attacked by a clown in a past

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:90%
life, or something?

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.999 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: But clowns also
represent a lot of, like,

00:47:09.999 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:84%
"Three Stooges" physical
activities, violence--

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.880 align:middle line:84%
not violence, but I mean, they
are doing activities which kids

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.750 align:middle line:84%
will think are very dangerous
and very hurtful, you know?

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So we'd have to find that out.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.660 align:middle line:90%
How about some volunteers.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.545 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take one person.

00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:27.436 align:middle line:90%
How about-- Bruce, go ahead.

00:47:27.436 --> 00:47:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes, how about--
ma'am, why don't you come up?

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I'll just sit
back and watch what you do.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:33.986 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Hi.

00:47:33.986 --> 00:47:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Hi.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Have a seat.

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.824 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:47:35.824 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Peggy.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.281 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Peggy.

00:47:37.281 --> 00:47:39.355 align:middle line:84%
Peggy, I want you to
just close your eyes,

00:47:39.355 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and just take a
nice deep breath.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And listen to my voice.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be counting
backwards from 10 to 1.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And with each count
backwards, you're

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:84%
going to get deeper
and deeper relaxed,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and enter into a
nice hypnotic level.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Number 10.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Getting nice and comfortable.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:00.990 align:middle line:84%
9, 8, number 7,
number 6, number 5.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You're halfway there.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:07.490 align:middle line:90%
4, number 3, number 2, number 1.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in just a moment I'm going
to count backwards one more

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.910 align:middle line:84%
time from 10 to 1, and
what I'd like you do

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is to move back into
a previous life that

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.490 align:middle line:84%
will help you understand
your purpose in this life,

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.820 align:middle line:84%
the origin of any
talent you may have,

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:27.030 align:middle line:84%
or anything that will be
significant in your life today,

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
on the count of 1.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Number 10, you're now entering
into a deep and dark tunnel

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.200 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by grasses and trees
and your favorite flowers.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It's getting lighter and lighter
with each count backwards.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:84%
9, 8, you can make out
your arms and legs,

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and now you're moving
backwards in time.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.919 align:middle line:84%
Number 7, allowing information
to flow in as the tunnel

00:48:47.919 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
gets lighter and lighter.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.872 align:middle line:84%
Number 6, number 5,
you can perceive a door

00:48:52.872 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:84%
with a bright white
light above it.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
open up that door

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and move into the environment
of this past life in just

00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:90%
a moment.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Number 4, number 3,
opening up a door.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Number 2, number 1.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.015 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel disappears
and you're now

00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:10.770 align:middle line:84%
in the environment of
this previous life.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me where
you find yourself?

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.284 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: I'm in an art studio.

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And about how old
would you say you are?

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Teenager.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.465 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: OK and are
you a male or female?

00:49:20.465 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Male.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So are you learning
how to do some sort of artwork?

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Oh, yes.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: What kind of work
are you learning how to do?

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.584 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: Oh, I'm
working with charcoal.

00:49:31.584 --> 00:49:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.857 align:middle line:84%
And are there other people
in the studio with you?

00:49:34.857 --> 00:49:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes, Several children.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.856 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:49:36.856 --> 00:49:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And is there somebody who is
your mentor or your teacher?

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.189 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
be moving forward

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.301 align:middle line:90%
in time in just a moment.

00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like you to
do is to move, oh,

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.320 align:middle line:90%
maybe by a year or so.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move to
your home environment.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to let me know where
you live, with whom you live,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and anything that
would be characteristic

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:56.870 align:middle line:90%
of this particular life.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.167 align:middle line:84%
As well as the time
period that you're in.

00:49:59.167 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%
You'll know approximately
what year this is,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%
or at least the century,
on the count to 5.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, moving forward now
to your home environment.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.240 align:middle line:90%
2, farther forward.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.100 align:middle line:90%
3, halfway there.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
4, almost there.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Number 5.

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:90%
OK now.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:19.615 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me where you find
yourself at this time, now?

00:50:19.615 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: Apart from
the studio, I --

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:25.075 align:middle line:90%
it's just a small stone house.

00:50:25.075 --> 00:50:25.741 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:50:25.741 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:90%
And who do you live there with?

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: My parents.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.326 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And how would you describe
your level of affluence,

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:90%
or level of wealth?

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: There is none.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So is it a poor family, is
that what you're saying?

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:36.783 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell me
the kind of clothes

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.345 align:middle line:90%
that you wear at this time?

00:50:40.345 --> 00:50:42.928 align:middle line:90%


00:50:42.928 --> 00:50:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: I think
I see a grey smock,

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:49.381 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's to
protective our clothing from--

00:50:49.381 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: I'm referring to
when you're not in the studio.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:52.580 align:middle line:90%
When you're at home.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.705 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: When I'm at home.

00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:03.575 align:middle line:84%
Soft shoes, leather shoes,
short pants, and maybe

00:51:03.575 --> 00:51:04.590 align:middle line:90%
a longer jacket.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.200 align:middle line:84%
If I was to ask you what
country you live in,

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.817 align:middle line:90%
how would you describe that?

00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:11.025 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Do you want a name?

00:51:11.025 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: A name, yes.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Italy.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.803 align:middle line:84%
And approximately what year
or what century is this,

00:51:14.803 --> 00:51:15.390 align:middle line:90%
would you say?

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.144 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: 1500, 1600.

00:51:17.144 --> 00:51:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's move
forward in time now.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:84%
When you hear me say the
words sleep, now, and rest,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:84%
this will help you
detach yourself

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.340 align:middle line:84%
from what you're
perceiving and move forward

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to another significant event.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move now
into at least your early

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to mid 20's, maybe
a little older,

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.930 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to move to a very
significant event in your life,

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:84%
especially in your professional
life, on the count of 5.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Number 1, moving forward.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Number 2, farther forward.

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:45.390 align:middle line:90%
3, halfway there.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:47.060 align:middle line:90%
4, almost there.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Number 5.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.473 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what has happened
since I last spoke with you.

00:51:51.473 --> 00:51:53.504 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.504 --> 00:51:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: I'm much
more successful.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm older, 22.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.376 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: And I'm dressed
nicer, I have nicer clothes.

00:52:01.376 --> 00:52:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And what
is your work now?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:03.480 align:middle line:90%
What do you---

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: I'm painting.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So now you're
a professional artist.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Mm, hm.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK, very good.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.930 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:11.859 align:middle line:84%
And how do you enjoy your level
of fulfillment in your work?

00:52:11.859 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: It's wonderful.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:90%
What would be your first name?

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.020 align:middle line:84%
How would I like
to refer to you?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.729 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Andrew.

00:52:19.729 --> 00:52:20.561 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Andrew?

00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:21.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good,.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, Andrew.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.186 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's sleep
now and rest now.

00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:25.794 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be moving forward
a little bit differently now.

00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:27.710 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be at
least 10 years in time,

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:28.910 align:middle line:90%
and maybe farther.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move to the most
significant professional event

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that will characterize your life
as Andrew in the Renaissance

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of Italy, on the count of 5.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Number 1, moving forward.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.950 align:middle line:90%
2, farther forward.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:45.560 align:middle line:90%
3, halfway there.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.590 align:middle line:90%
4, almost there.

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Number 5.

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, Andrew, let's see
what has transpired

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:90%
since I last spoke with you.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: I'm older.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.335 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK, all right.

00:52:55.335 --> 00:52:58.455 align:middle line:84%
How old would you say
you are now, roughly?

00:52:58.455 --> 00:52:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: 30's.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.516 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on in your
life that's significant?

00:53:01.516 --> 00:53:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: We're
busily preparing.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We have a huge-- we finished
a contract, a commission.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's several
of us work together,

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and we're very successful.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Is there anything
unusual about your work

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:16.530 align:middle line:84%
or something that is significant
about your professional

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
achievements, other than just
the commissions and working

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:19.490 align:middle line:90%
with other artists?

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: I think just
the dynamics of the piece

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:27.835 align:middle line:90%
and the techniques that we used.

00:53:27.835 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: What
about the techniques?

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything unusual
about the techniques?

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: It looks
much more vibrant.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I think it must be the paint.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So are you doing
something that's a little bit

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.700 align:middle line:84%
different than the other
artists at the time?

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.715 align:middle line:84%
Are you well known
for that, too?

00:53:41.715 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Not yet.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:43.620 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move forward,
much farther forward now.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.048 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like you
to do, Andrew, is

00:53:47.048 --> 00:53:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move forward
to the very last day of life.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You will not have crossed into
spirit or clinically died,

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.280 align:middle line:90%
you'll be perfectly safe.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be aware of the
circumstances that are around,

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.500 align:middle line:84%
approximate age, what
you're suffering from,

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and anybody else that may
be around at that time,

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.750 align:middle line:90%
on the count of 5.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, moving
forward to the last day

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.110 align:middle line:90%
of your life as Andrew.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.210 align:middle line:90%
2, farther forward.

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.020 align:middle line:90%
3, halfway there.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.280 align:middle line:90%
4, almost there.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Number 5.

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Number 5, now.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.780 align:middle line:84%
All right, Andrew, let me
know, approximately now,

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.085 align:middle line:84%
how old would you just say
you are at this time, now?

00:54:21.085 --> 00:54:21.994 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: 50's.

00:54:21.994 --> 00:54:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.454 align:middle line:84%
And where are you
now on this last day?

00:54:25.454 --> 00:54:27.745 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: >>I'm in a beautiful
home, but it's not mine.

00:54:27.745 --> 00:54:28.411 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody with you
that you can recall?

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Not at this point.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:90%
And what are you suffering from?

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:36.228 align:middle line:90%


00:54:36.228 --> 00:54:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: I want to say lungs.

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Lungs, OK.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.380 align:middle line:90%
We're going to leave this now.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cross into
spirit, clinically rise

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:44.100 align:middle line:84%
above, leaving
the physical body,

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.600 align:middle line:84%
rejoining the higher
self, and being

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.210 align:middle line:84%
able to overview this life as
Andrew, as to what you learned

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and what you didn't
learn, on the count of 5.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:84%
One, rising up and above,
leaving the physical body.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly safe.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Two, rising above.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Three, halfway there.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Four, almost there.

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.532 align:middle line:90%
Number five.

00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now from the life
of Andrew, what

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.850 align:middle line:84%
was the most significant event
or circumstance or principle

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:08.554 align:middle line:84%
that you learned
in a positive way

00:55:08.554 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:90%
from the life of the Andrew?

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: Working
with other people.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: OK, in
the art, you mean?

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.143 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.302 align:middle line:90%
It was very satisfying.

00:55:14.302 --> 00:55:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Very good.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
that the opposite,

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.842 align:middle line:84%
what were you not able
to do or accomplish

00:55:18.842 --> 00:55:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that you would have liked to?

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> PEGGY: I didn't
have a family.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No family.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Sleep now and rest.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:25.007 align:middle line:90%
You've done very well.

00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be counting
forwards from one to five

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:84%
one more time, and
when I do, you'll

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.636 align:middle line:84%
return back to the
present life as Peggy.

00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:32.760 align:middle line:84%
You'll have complete memories
of everything we did,

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and what you experienced,
and re-experienced.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
get more information

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.820 align:middle line:84%
about the life of Andrew, or
other lives, past or future,

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:84%
in future experiences,
on the count of five.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Number one, returning
back to the current.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Two, moving farther forward.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Three, halfway there.

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.505 align:middle line:90%
Four, almost there.

00:55:51.505 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Number five, wide awake,
relaxed and refreshed.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.230 align:middle line:90%
How you doing, Peggy?

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Wonderful.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Do you remember
everything that we discussed

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:00.245 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:56:00.245 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Now tell me,
do you do artwork now?

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Yes.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Have you had
any professional training

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in your current life?

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: No.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: No
professional training?

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: No.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Isn't
that interesting.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a karmic carryover.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.281 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, not to worry,
because you're going to be very

00:56:12.281 --> 00:56:13.129 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:56:13.129 --> 00:56:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Very good,
because normally people--

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:18.580 align:middle line:84%
art is a very, very precise
field and it takes a lot

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of training.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so your karmic carryover
from 400 or 500 years ago

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:23.780 align:middle line:90%
carried over now.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Mm, hm.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.451 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Interesting.

00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:27.999 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of artwork
or painting do you do now?

00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: I do portraits.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Portraits, OK.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:32.285 align:middle line:84%
And you were being trained to
do that in the Renaissance.

00:56:32.285 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> PEGGY: Right.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.368 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Peggy, thank you.

00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:36.362 align:middle line:90%
Let's have it.

00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:36.862 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:36.862 --> 00:56:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's OK.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.193 align:middle line:90%
You can go back now.

00:56:38.193 --> 00:56:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Thank
you, very much.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:41.202 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:56:41.202 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, give her--
she did 99% of the work.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a trainer here.

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.076 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah,
but you're smooth.

00:56:46.076 --> 00:56:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You almost put me out
while that was going on.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is like a relaxation
technique that gets you.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I always
thought a hypnotist had

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to have a little
pendulum, you know.

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: I know.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.474 align:middle line:90%
That's a stage part.

00:56:58.474 --> 00:56:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You don't do that?

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: No, I mean--
or the hypnodisks, you know,

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.455 align:middle line:90%
you've seen those things.

00:57:03.455 --> 00:57:05.080 align:middle line:84%
This is, remember,
it's for a daydream.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
driving in the car

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.728 align:middle line:84%
and every DMV and police
department around the United

00:57:08.728 --> 00:57:11.701 align:middle line:84%
States has these studies, this
is called highway or freeway

00:57:11.701 --> 00:57:12.200 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Now nobody's waving
a pendulum in front of you.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
radio, you're watching,

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're seeing the
white line at night,

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.640 align:middle line:84%
or the various exit signs
that you'rw passing by.

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You get from A to B
and don't even remember how you

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:90%
did that.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: That's
time distortion.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.211 align:middle line:90%
So this is natural.

00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So basically, anyone
could do this.

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Peggy is just an average person.

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And so my point is, if you
do the right techniques,

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.140 align:middle line:84%
if-- Peggy has, obviously,
a high opinion of me,

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.326 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure from the
show, thanks to you.

00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:37.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're dealing with a stage
hypnotist, a lot of people

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.890 align:middle line:84%
will reject them because
they're thinking,

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.889 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're a con artist,
you're an entertainer.

00:57:40.889 --> 00:57:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.259 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
like the therapist,

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:44.841 align:middle line:84%
you'll never be able
to work with him.

00:57:44.841 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Hypnosis, there's no drugs.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.570 align:middle line:90%
This is all rapport.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and that's
what's so important.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:50.810 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite books, by
the way, by Dr. Bruce Goldberg,

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.230 align:middle line:90%
"Exploring the Fifth Dimension."

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You're a pretty
accomplished author.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.020 align:middle line:84%
You've helped so many
people in your life.

00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.613 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:57:59.613 --> 00:58:00.937 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Bruce.

00:58:00.937 --> 00:58:01.978 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:04.816 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:04.816 --> 00:58:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And thank you to Peggy
for opening up her life for us,

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.280 align:middle line:90%
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation, something
I've always believed in.

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why it
happens and how it happens.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But all I know, in the
future, I'm Dexter Monterrey

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and I've got 100
million listeners.

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:24.652 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:58:24.652 --> 00:58:43.800 align:middle line:90%
