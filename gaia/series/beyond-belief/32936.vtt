00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to believe anymore.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.051 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; People are basically
going to need to keep

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.854 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on to help uncover
what really happened.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; So, I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.628 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:32.165 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
[ Music ]

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; [Applause] And now the host

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the nationally
syndicated Coast to Coast AM

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:39.573 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and Gaiam TV bring you Beyond
Belief with George Noory.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.141 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Here we have a South
African author,

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
researcher and investigator.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
He deals with ancient
civilizations.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Please welcome Michael
Tellinger.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
[Applause] Thank you, Michael.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
How are you?

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Good to see you.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Michael Tellinger:
Good to see you.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:54.955 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Have a seat.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
What's new since the
last time I saw you?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.959 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Michael Tellinger:
Oh, more discoveries,

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
more mind blowing stuff.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.496 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
It never seems to stop.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.764 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: It
doesn't end, does it?

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:07.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
How did you get interested
in ancient civilizations?

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Tellinger:
That's a good question

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because I don't actually
even remember myself.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:16.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've always since the earliest
of times in my life even

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as a five year old I used to
go outside and look at the sky

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and say when are they going
to start talking to us?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And then by the time I turned 18
and I read Erich von Daniken --

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.155 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; George Noory:
Chariots of the Gods.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.356 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Michael Tellinger:
Chariots of the Gods,

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:32.426 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that I think was really
the key moment in my life

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that everything changed for me.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.962 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Super.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.563 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Doesn't he look like
Clark Gable by the way?

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.966 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
You look just like him.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Zecharia Sitchin, of
course, his theory was

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:47.607 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that there was a civilization
that came here, seeded us,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
basically created us,
that they were the gods.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.315 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You've looked into that theory,
too, and you agree with him.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Michael Tellinger: Not
only do I agree with him,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I think that I'm in the very
fortunate position in the work

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and the research
I've been doing is

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.858 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to finally provide
the physical evidence

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for what Zecharia
Sitchin has written about.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:12.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And what's fascinating for
me is the more research I do

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:18.839 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and the more parts of Sitchin's
work I revisit the more we find

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:24.044 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
specific places in South Africa
that echo what he wrote about.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.947 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So when Sitchin wrote
these statements

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or these translations
he didn't know

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that we would discover
them and find them.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that for me is critical in
verifying and validating much

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of what he did and now taking it
to the next level and figuring

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:42.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
out what were these people
up to, who were they,

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and exposing the vastness of it
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's talk about
Sitchin for a moment

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.671 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so people can have a
better idea of what he did,

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.142 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
what he uncovered and
how he found this.

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:58.879 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, he talks about the
Annuna gods or the Annunaki,

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.415 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the gods of heaven
and earth that came

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.317 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to earth a long time
ago looking for gold.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And this gold thing is critical,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because in all ancient cultures
you can't separate human origins

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and our obsession for gold.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we can trace it to -- it's
actually a human obsession,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it's actually an obsessions
of the Gods or the Annunaki.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:26.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the establishment of
this vast gold mining empire

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in this place called the Abzu.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.777 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So if you try and reverse
engineer the situation,

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
trying to figure out
where the Abzu is,

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
if we can find the
physical evidence

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:40.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and present a vast gold mining
operation then we can say --

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure, ancient
and you can see it.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: Ancient exactly, with
the tools and the artifacts

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.561 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and add the technology to
it that's new technology

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.464 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to us today that we
don't yet understand,

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.899 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and realize that these
ancients had this technology,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.769 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that there are more
than ten million

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of these stone structures in
southern African and it's all

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
about gold mining, then
I guess we've found Abzu

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.947 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that Zecharia Sitchin talks
about, and the Abzu is

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.448 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
where the gold mining
was happening

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.552 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: What were they
looking for gold for?

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Were they greedy people
and this was their wealth,

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or was there another reason?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah, no, no.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is the critical thing
that you start to discover

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:25.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when you start looking at
how much we really know

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about ancient civilizations.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.502 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
The gold is not about wealth,

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's not about trade
and commerce.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.672 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And in fact Annunaki
were the ones as well

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.909 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that introduced the concept
of money to the human race.

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.312 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Money is not part of the
process of barter and trade

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.547 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
for thousands of years.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There's a very specific
time in human history

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that the Annunaki introduced
the concept of money,

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and that goes back thousands
and thousands of years.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:53.827 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The gold is all about
a variety of things.

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:55.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And actually the more you look

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:57.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
into it the more
mysterious it becomes.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We've heard about the fact
that as Sitchin writes

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that they used the gold, they
ground it up to a fine powder

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.372 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and they suspended it
around their planet

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:09.943 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
to protect their planet against
universal rays, cosmic rays.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:10.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Kind of like a layer.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly, a
protective shield.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.115 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Their planet was
dying and so forth.

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:19.119 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Well, that may have been
Sitchin's translation then,

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.889 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but if he knew what we know
now about the various aspects

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.525 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of gold he might have
changed his opinion

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.761 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
on the meaning of
that translation.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I believe that it led a far
more important role and in terms

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the cladding of their planet.

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Because what the Annunaki were
doing here was pretty much going

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
against what Star Trek
has been calling for many,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
many decades now
the prime directive.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.145 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And this is a very
interesting fine point.

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:48.081 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I've been finding that
this concept called the prime

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
directive plays a critical
role in human evolution

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:52.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and human development.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:55.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And the Annunaki juggled

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.425 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that prime directive ball
very, very delicately.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I actually truly believe
now more than anything else

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that the gold was used
more as a cladding device

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to clad their planet including
planet earth with some sort

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:13.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of a shield that made our planet
and their planet invisible

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.543 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to the prying eyes of other
beings of consciousness

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.912 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so they couldn't see what
was going on on this planet

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and the abuse that was
happening of a species

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that was being created
specifically

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:25.685 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
for the mining of gold.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.021 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: How much gold did they
pull out of this [inaudible].

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
A lot.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.825 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, you know how
much gold the Vatican brought

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:33.393 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
from the Americas, right,

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when they first landed
here in the Americas.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that's the same for the rest
of the world and then especially

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.367 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in South Africa and
southern Africa.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.335 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The amount of gold that
has come out of it,

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we don't know how much
gold has come out of it

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
because there is no real record.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Well, I guess there is a record
but we'll never see that record.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What I do know is that once
the gold leaves the gold mines

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.714 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of South Africa and
has been paid

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:58.685 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
for by the South African
reserve bank with fiat money --

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:01.087 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: Which means money that
nothing is backing, right?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes, exactly.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.757 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Basically piece of
paper that they take --

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: And just print it, sure.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.359 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: Print some logos
on it and say, well here,

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we've paid you for the gold.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.895 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: We need to get
into that business.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; MT: Oh, yeah.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So which means basically
stealing our resources

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
from the people and paying
for it with pieces of paper.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:19.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Once the gold leaves the
mines we can't trace it.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:20.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
It disappears.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:23.677 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It goes into the Rand
Refinery in South Africa,

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:26.279 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and then from there we have
no idea what happens to it.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Okay, so when
this group came here,

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.751 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the Annunaki, how long ago?

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, Sitchin calculated

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
about 435,000 to
450,000 years ago.

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Okay.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; MT: And my research shows
that the tools and the artifacts

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:47.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the origins of humankind the
furthest I can take it back is

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:51.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
around 285,000 years ago which
is an interesting number,

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:54.274 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as you know, because of the
mitochondrial eve studies

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:58.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
suggest that humanity suddenly
sprung up out of nowhere

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:02.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
around 250,000 to
300,000 years ago.

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.316 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
So it's still consistent.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The tools and artifacts and
especially Adam's Calendar

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.956 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which is one of the places
that we found in South Africa

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
which is connected to the
Annunaki and specifically Enki.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
That shows that that
was established

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
about 285,000 years ago.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:19.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Okay, so they
come here to mine gold,

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.837 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and all of a sudden the
beings, the inhabitants

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.307 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
who come here they don't want
to do the work anymore do they?

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:28.508 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; MT: That's it.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: So somebody comes
up with a grand idea, hey,

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:34.414 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the species that happened to
be on the planet at the time,

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.749 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
what were they, Neanderthals?

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:36.783 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; MT: Good question.

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:37.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Who knows, right?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.553 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: Homo Erectus, Homo
Habilis, Neanderthals,

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:41.988 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
they could have been a whole --

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Not human, though.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.393 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Not human, not the
way that we see humans today.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:50.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Alright, so they decide
let's genetically alter this

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:55.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
species and create
us in their image.

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Sounds like the Bible,
doesn't it?

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: It certainly does.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:59.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Is that what they do?

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: That's what Sitchin's
translation's all about.

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And not just his translations.

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:06.446 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There are various
other translations.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:07.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And it's important to note

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that not everything Sitchin
wrote was true and accurate.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
He made mistakes like we all do.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: But now it's for us to
identify and recognize those

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.224 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and replace them
with new information.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.894 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So that's exactly what
seems to have happened.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Did some sort of
genetic meddling happen,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
genetic experimentation
happened that these --

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: To make workers.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.201 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: To make workers.

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They were masters -- there's one
thing that we need to specify.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They were masters of
technology and masters

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:37.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of genetic manipulation.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And they seem to continue
having that mastery today.

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:42.649 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And so they created this --

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: [Inaudible]

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:44.684 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:48.988 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: And the Adam and
the Eve and Genesis talking

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:52.325 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
about the first man and woman
they really were the Adam

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:55.028 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and Eve of this genetic
manipulation?

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:56.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Absolutely.

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:58.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But my information is,
and based on what I found

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in South Africa, is that

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.504 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the first beings that were
cloned they were neither male

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:05.738 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
nor female.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They were probably more male
because they were larger

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and more masculine in shape.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:13.112 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But they did not yet have
the X or Y chromosomes.

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So the first humans cloned by
the Annunaki only had 22 pairs

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of chromosomes which is
an interesting number

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:22.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when you start dealing
in numeric science.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:25.825 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And many geneticists like
William Brown suggest

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:29.062 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that originally we had only
22 pairs of chromosomes.

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.764 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And then when they realized
that they needed the species --

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.935 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because they cloned
the first humanoid

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.037 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to be a worker, nothing else.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Then they realized they
couldn't clone enough

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of them fast enough --

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:42.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: They needed
them to breed.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: They needed
them to breed.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So that's when we suddenly see
several thousand years later the

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
introduction of the
X and Y chromosomes

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
so they could procreate.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:55.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that's where the
Biblical story comes into play

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:58.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
when they took the
rib from Adam.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Basically what they're telling
us they took a little bit

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of genetic material from Adam --

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Stem cells.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.699 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: Stem cells, exactly,
and created a female.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And that's why when they
put them into this sort

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:12.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of circle Garden of Eden was
really an experiment to see

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.973 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
if after copulation

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and procreation the female
wouldn't eat the male

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as many species do, right?

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.879 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's true.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Just an amazing story.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.817 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; MT: It is.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Now, but you're not
saying there is not a god

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because the interpretation
of Genesis, fallen angels,

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:34.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
we're really talking
about these beings

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:37.363 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
who came down here aren't we?

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; MT: What this very
clearly highlights is

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that they are just another group

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.703 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of beings created
by [inaudible].

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Higher on the
totem pole basically.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.541 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What I refer to as God with
a big G, the creator of all,

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.047 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the source of all things.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Whatever it is.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Whatever that original
source of consciousness is

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:02.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that has brought everything into
creation, visible and invisible.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
We're just aspects of that.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.226 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So what this does,
what this information

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and this research does it
actually highlights how much

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
bigger and greater
the creator is.

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:13.666 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: I agree.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's one of the most
fascinating stories ever.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Let's take some questions
from you

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
for our guest Michael Tellinger.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Just raise your hand
and I'll point to you.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:21.574 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Yes, right over here.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.143 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Why don't we hear more
about the civilizations

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in South African, the research
that's being done there?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; MT: Mainly because
it flies in the face

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:33.686 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of mainstream history
and archeology.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:39.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I'm at this stage I seem
to be the sort of lone voice

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:41.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that talks about this.

00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:44.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You'll hear a lot of
stories and information

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:48.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about ancient civilizations
in mainstream history books,

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:52.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but they regurgitate the same
information over and over again.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:58.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And it generally stops at
a certain time in history.

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:02.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What I talk about is
a much longer history,

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:05.818 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and this previously
unknown history,

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:08.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the vanished civilizations
of southern Africa

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that I've been exposing.

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:12.659 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: These lost civilizations
that you have looked

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.262 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
into what happened to them, and
why did we lose the knowledge

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of what happened to them?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: And this is a great
story, an important question

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because what this does, again,

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:26.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it brings together
the one historic event

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that virtually all ancient
cultures talk about.

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:32.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And that seems to be this
great flood that happened.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:34.414 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: We call it the
flood of Noah, right?

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.415 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the Sumerian
Tablets talk about it,

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.885 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the Bible talks about it.

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:42.355 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Every ancient civilization
has a great flood that came

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
at some stage and
wiped the slate clean.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the evidence suggests that
that's exactly what happened

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:51.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in South Africa and
southern African based

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on the sedimentation and
the fact that the majority

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the stone ruins are still
buried by many meters of soil

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and sediment and
specifically sea sand.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.142 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: It sounds like a
tsunami to me, Michael.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:06.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, it's a huge --
it must have been huge waves

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:09.916 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because we find sea
fossils, seashells --

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.184 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Way in, right?

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MT: -- on tops of mountains
inside the stone ruins.

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: On tops of mountains.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: On tops of mountains.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: So the water had to
get up that high obviously.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.458 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; MT: That high.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And also down in
the Barberton Valley

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where Adam's Calendar looks over
the Barberton Valley there's

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:29.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
about 15 or more meters
of sediment of sea sand.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.104 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's dramatic.

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:33.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
How about another question
for Michael Tellinger?

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
Yes, sir?

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Hi Michael.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:39.011 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You do a lot of research on the
stone circles in South Africa.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I was wondering if
you found any evidence

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of pyramids in South Africa?

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Thank you
for that question.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Definitely.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Pyramids seem to be a common
denominator all over the planet.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.193 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And more and more pyramids
are being found everywhere.

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:58.564 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And there definitely are two
distinct pyramidal structures

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.868 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that are connected
to Adam's Calendar.

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They lie in the Barberton
Valley that I just mentioned

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:07.707 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that is filled with
sediment of sea sand.

00:15:07.707 --> 00:15:13.045 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We have no definite proof
that they are pyramids yet,

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.348 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but they certainly
look like pyramids.

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:20.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They are connected to Adam's
Calendar via a golden spiral

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
which the probability that they
are not connected can be now

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
assumed that they are connected.

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:29.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And they display the
same strange phenomenon

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:34.534 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at these pyramidal structures
that you lose GPS signal

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when you go in there just
like you do at Adam's Calendar

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:38.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and in many of the stone
circles that you go

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:42.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
into because they are all
energy generating devices.

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.211 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And that is one of the key
discoveries that I've made.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:49.015 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So they are strange
pyramidal structures.

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You lose GPS, they emanate
strange energies, sound,

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:55.888 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and electromagnetic frequencies
have come out of them.

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:59.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And also they align with
the rise of Orion's belt

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:03.062 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
from the viewpoint when you
stand at Adam's Calendar,

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.096 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the pyramidal structures.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:08.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: Michael, Zecharia Sitchin
talked about the Annunaki,

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that they came from
another planet

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
within our own solar
system, Nibiru.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:13.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: Where is that planet now?

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.275 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; MT: Good question.

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Everyone is asking
that question,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I wish we had more
definite answers for that.

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Whether Nibiru is a planet

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
or a whole other solar
system I think is still out,

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
the jury is out on that.

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Just recently, several
years ago,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there was this strange planet
or a star with several planets

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.831 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
around it, it was either a
star with planets or a planet

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.133 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with moons that was
moving towards us

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and that suddenly vanished.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.136 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
It's no longer there.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:45.404 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Where did it go?

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:46.639 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now, the cladding effect
that I refer to of the gold,

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:52.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and this is what gold has,
the monoatomic form of gold,

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.948 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the white powder of
gold, has this capacity

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.617 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to make things disappear.

00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:58.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; GN: Cloaking.

00:16:58.284 --> 00:16:59.352 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; MT: Cloaking it.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So you cannot detect
it energetically,

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:05.524 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I believe the Annunaki
understood this very, very --

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they're masters of technology.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In fact, all the technology
we have today probably is a

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.765 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
hangover from the Annunaki.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take another
question for Michael Tellinger.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Who's got one as we talk
about ancient civilizations?

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
You.

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:23.776 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you had
any idea what the Annunaki

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
look like.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: I love this question.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; MT: I know, it's a tough one.

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:30.549 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: It comes up a lot.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.452 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Many have said that
they look like us

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:36.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because we are in their image.

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:39.025 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: Right, and I would
have to concur with that.

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:44.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But unfortunately the human
race does not all look the same.

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:48.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're not actually the human
race, we're the human races,

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:52.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and there are many race
groups among human beings.

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that's a critical question
that we need to answer.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:58.678 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Why do we have Chinese people
and why do we have Black people

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:00.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and why do we have
Nordic people?

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.382 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Because if we all came from the
same seed we should all look

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:04.016 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
the same.

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Absolutely.

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:07.153 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know I was thinking about
that, going in to do Coast

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:12.291 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to Coast last week, that this
planet has this vast amount

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of different cultures
and ethnicities.

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And for a moment I kept saying
maybe it's the geographic region

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.802 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that these people live in

00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:25.838 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and that's why they look
the way they look, right?

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:29.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That Africa which is generally
sunnier you get tanned more,

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:33.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you get darker, but it
just didn't make any sense

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
when I thought about it.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:40.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's almost as if every race
on this planet was created

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
by a race that looked like them.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; MT: That's what it has to be.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So we see the resemblance in
features, physical features

00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:51.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the different race
groups from the star seeds

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:53.666 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that must have originally
created them

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
or that they come from.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.136 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I love that story
that you just mentioned

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because when I was at school
whenever I asked, well,

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where do white people and Black
people come from the answer was,

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
well, Black people spend
more time in the sun

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and that's why they develop
more melanin and they get darker

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.582 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and they get more
resistant to the sun.

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, that suggests that
originally everybody was white

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and then got darker with time.

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:14.887 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: Which is not the case.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.122 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Which is not the case.

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:19.425 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So that's an insane
suggestion to start off with.

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:22.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But the Annunaki based
on the descriptions

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:27.199 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the Sumerian Tablets
which Sitchin brings forth is

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
when they refer to Enki is that
they describe him as being tall,

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:38.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
having the hair the color of
the sun and the eyes the color

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:42.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of the sky and he
was light skinned.

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.284 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
So maybe the Nordics are closer

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to the Annunaki than
anyone else.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Now, you kind of hinted
that they may still be around.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
What did you mean?

00:19:52.158 --> 00:19:53.292 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, there's no doubt

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.761 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that the Annunaki left
behind their offspring,

00:19:55.761 --> 00:20:00.099 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and there's definitely a huge
global movement with Marduk,

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:04.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one of Enki's sons that was in
charge, it seems like he was

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.939 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in charge of Egypt for a long
time and various parts --

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:09.108 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that part of the world.

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:13.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And Marduk was left behind
to look after this planet

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.082 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and did not necessarily
do the kind of job

00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:17.116 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that he was expected to do.

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:18.617 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: He didn't do a good job.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:19.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
&gt;&gt; MT: No.

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:22.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So there are these two
factions of the Annunaki,

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.958 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
those that left behind
that retained a lower level

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of consciousness
and took the world

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in a very different
draconian kind of suppressive

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and oppressive direction
that we are experiencing

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.504 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on this earth today
with absolute control

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.639 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
through governments
and oppression.

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:45.544 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And those that left the
higher consciousness Annunaki

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that allowed themselves
to grow in consciousness.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
They are beings as well.

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Thousands and thousands
of years have gone by,

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:55.588 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
their consciousness
has exploded as well.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.724 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So now we have the higher
consciousness Annunaki

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.226 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the lower consciousness
Annunaki.

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:05.097 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I believe those
that left being Enlil

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:11.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and Enki are very active
from a much higher dimension

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.241 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to restore the problems
that are being caused

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
by their offspring
on this planet.

00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:22.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: They say that the
Annunaki were a warring group,

00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that they attacked each
other, and look what kind

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.887 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
of folks we are on this planet.

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
We're doing the same thing.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.091 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: I think it gets even
more complicated than that.

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:35.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Because the Annunaki
were not the only ETs

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:36.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that were active on this planet.

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:38.497 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
There were many, many others.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:40.032 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: The grays
that we've heard.

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:43.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: The grays, the Zeta
Reticuli, many others.

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:46.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And there are many
researchers that speak

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
about that aspect of it.

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:50.342 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And we need to take
cognizance of that

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:55.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and see how the Annunaki's
activities here compares

00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:59.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to the other interventions and
activities of extraterrestrials.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But it seems that the
Annunaki were the very powerful

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.427 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and I guess dominant ETs here

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:12.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because of the giant gold mining
operation that they created

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:16.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the fact that they were
raping this planet for minerals.

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then they were joined
by other ETs that came

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to rape this planet
for more minerals.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:22.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: But they were the firs?

00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:24.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: It seems like it.

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:26.445 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
At this stage it seems like it.

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:30.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's amazing how
the Book of Genesis kind

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:33.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of echoes this story if
you look for that story.

00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:35.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And what I find fascinating
is when you read Genesis

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.061 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and you come back to the gold
you find it's various obvious

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:45.864 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that it's not humans that were
obsessed, but it's the Annunaki

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or the Elohim, because
Annunaki also referred

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:50.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to themselves as the Elohim.

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:53.472 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
This is critical to understand.

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:56.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it is the Elohim
in the Bible

00:22:56.709 --> 00:23:00.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that first mentioned the
word gold, not the humans.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
It's a Genesis --

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.314 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Powdered gold,
too, right?

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:03.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:05.684 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But the word gold first
comes to us from God

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
or the Elohim in Genesis 2.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When Eve had not yet been
fashioned from Adam's rib,

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Adam was still alone
on earth, and it's gods

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.829 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that mentions the word gold

00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when he says there's
a land called Havilah,

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:22.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
there's great water
and the land is good,

00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:24.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the water is good
and there is gold.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:28.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And in there we find the clues
that the Elohim were obsessed

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.075 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
with gold and not the humans.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: They used gold also

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in a powdered form
and they ingested it.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.881 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
What did it do to them?

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, we know from
the great works of people

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:43.355 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
like David Hudson and other
researchers, Laurence Gardner

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that speak about the
white powder of gold

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or the monoatomic gold
or the Bible referred

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:50.729 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to it as manna from heaven.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:56.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And they seem to have used
it as a curative substance

00:23:56.268 --> 00:24:00.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to keep them healthy, to keep
them physically immortal.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:04.443 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
It has numerous properties.

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.711 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
It's a super conductor.

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:09.648 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So if you ingested it basically
what it does it helps --

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the circuits inside your body,

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:16.288 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
your nervous system becomes
a super conductor then

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so that you no longer
have to take milliseconds

00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
for the information to travel

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but it travels instantly
throughout your body.

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:28.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So your DNA gets healed by it,
you can cure disease with it.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Plus it levitates.

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:31.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: It levitates?

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:32.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: It levitates.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The white powder
of gold levitates.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:39.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
David Hudson talks about when
they were doing the laboratory

00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:43.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
experiments with MIT when they
had a little fluffy powder

00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:46.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in the tube of inert gas
when he brought his hand

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:51.323 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
under it a little pile of
powder lifted up and levitates.

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So what that suggests that
we actually have monoatomic

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
elements in our bodies because
when you bring your hand below

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.332 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
it it makes it repels it.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.701 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
While a magnet when you put a
magnet there it does nothing.

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They tried all kinds
of things bring

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.071 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
under the white powder of gold.

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:08.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Only the human body
would make it respond.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:11.443 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And it's also interesting
that it's the gold

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:16.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because gold is not the only
element that can be turned

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:22.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
into a monoatomic
element from the group

00:25:22.054 --> 00:25:24.623 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of elements that do that.

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:28.927 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There are about 9 or 11 of
them if I remember, platinum,

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
group of metals, yeah.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:36.235 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But it's gold that seems to
flux at body temperature.

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:40.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so they were interested in
the gold alone, not platinum,

00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:44.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or iridium or rubidium
and so forth.

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:46.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Gold is the one they
were looking after.

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that is critical as
well because in South Africa

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:54.586 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the Province of Limpopo
there are dozens and dozens

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of underground tunnels,
ancient gold mining tunnels

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:00.793 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that were mined by the Annunaki

00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:03.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because there's no other
explanation for it.

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:04.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
They're ancient.

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:07.566 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They were discovered in the
30s by modern gold miners.

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:10.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And in these tunnels
there is no gold

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but there is platinum slag
that's been left behind

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in these tunnels.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So they weren't interested
in the platinum,

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they were interested
in the gold.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Tell me about
these stone circle ruins

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:22.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that you've looked into.

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah, and so glad
you came back to that

00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because that is the
thing that explains a lot

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.992 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
about the Annunaki, Enki and
this vast gold mining empire.

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:36.195 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Because the stone circles,
first of all there are more

00:26:36.195 --> 00:26:39.231 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
than ten million of the
circular stone ruins.

00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:40.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: And where are
they, everywhere?

00:26:40.466 --> 00:26:43.101 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: They're all over
South Africa, Zimbabwe,

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:46.438 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
part of Botswana, Mozambique,
and I believe they cross

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:49.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
over the Zambezi into
southern Zambia as well.

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:56.248 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And they are what is best
described as the factory

00:26:56.248 --> 00:27:01.753 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that powered -- the
factory and the power plant

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:07.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that was the giant gold
mining empire of the Annunaki.

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.795 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And all the stone
circles are circular.

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:13.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Each one has a very unique
design because actually each one

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of them is an energy
generating device.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.069 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I know this because
we measured them.

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:19.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They create huge amounts
of sound frequencies

00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:22.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in the gigahertz
which is unheard of.

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: Were they build in these
locations for a specific reason?

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes, they were
built at specific locations

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because they actually suck
out the sound frequency,

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
the sound energy
of Gaia,

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:38.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and that's why each one is
unique, because each one

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:40.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of the stone circles
is a symatic

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:42.828 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
representation of
the sound frequency

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:44.162 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
on the surface of planet earth.

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So it becomes like an energetic
plug point into the earth,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and then they share the
energy that they amplify

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
because of the sound frequencies

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:55.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that these stone
walls then amplify

00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:58.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and generate electromagnetic
fields out of the sound.

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:02.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So sound becomes a precursor
to electromagnetic fields,

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and then they share this
energy by these channels

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that connect all the
stone circles together.

00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:12.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So you got more than ten million
stone circles that I found

00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:15.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
or calculated that cover
most of southern Africa.

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.396 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They're all connected
by these channels.

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:22.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And they created this huge power
plant that created the energy

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.304 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
for the extraction of the gold,
the technology that they used

00:28:25.304 --> 00:28:28.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to extract the gold from the
tunnels and for the processing

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the gold and the
separation of the minerals

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and whatever they needed to do.

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: How did we lose this
information, this knowledge?

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, the flood
as we discussed already.

00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Wiped out everything.

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MT: The flood wiped it out.

00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:42.788 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
That seems to be a very
important dividing line

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:45.257 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in human history, in
recent human history.

00:28:45.257 --> 00:28:48.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: And you think that
flood was generated on purpose

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:51.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
as the Bible dictates?

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: I don't think so.

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:53.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Just a catastrophe.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:55.233 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; MT: I think it
was a catastrophe

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:59.371 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and Annunaki knew it was coming
and they prepared for it.

00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:01.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And I also know they
prepared for it

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:04.876 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
because we have technology that
has detected many, many tunnels

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:08.046 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that lie hidden below the
soil, that technology exists.

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.815 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And we know that where
that those tunnels are,

00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:11.817 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and we also know that those
tunnels are still filled

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:13.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
with gold.

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.287 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And that is a huge discovery.

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:18.223 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: What do you think, they
saw an astroid coming this way?

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.324 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, either
an astroid or --

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Predicted where
it was going to hit?

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah, either an astroid

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:25.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or as Sitchin suggests
their planet or one

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of their moons was coming
very close to planet earth

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:33.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and they knew it was going to
cause huge geophysical effects

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:38.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that would cause a
tsunami or the giant waves

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that became known
as the great flood.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
So the Annunaki prepared for it.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They hid all the gold in
the tunnels underground,

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and many people would
have then gone

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.957 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
into the tunnels underground
to try and hide from the flood.

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:53.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: And they got wiped out.

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; MT: They got wiped out.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:58.263 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So we found lots of tunnels
that are filled with bones,

00:29:58.263 --> 00:30:00.832 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
human remains and
filled with gold,

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and there are thousands of them.

00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:04.836 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: And they could
be that old?

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: They definitely go
back about 12,000 years.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In fact, there's one grave
sight that is very close

00:30:12.244 --> 00:30:15.847 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
to Adam's Calendar that we are
convinced is actually the grave

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:19.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
sight of Enki's youngest
son called Dumuzi.

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:22.354 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the Sumerian Tablets
very clearly tell the story

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of Enona and Dumuzi,

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:26.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and when Dumuzi died
after the flood.

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:29.995 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So that's recent, it's like
12,000 years ago, right?

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:33.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And Enona took him to the
deep Abzu where she buried him

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:37.135 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
on the edge of a cliff near his
father's special place looking

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:39.738 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
east so that his soul
would be everlasting.

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And there's a grave right
there that we've detected

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:47.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with infrared technology
that there's a cavity

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:50.549 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about three meters deep and
about three meters long.

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:53.018 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now, a human grave would
not be three meters long,

00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:54.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
it would be a lot shorter.

00:30:54.753 --> 00:30:57.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And it's been confirmed
by Baba Credo Mutwa,

00:30:57.889 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the preeminent Zulu Shaman
in South Africa who said

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.097 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that there is an ancient
king buried at that site.

00:31:05.097 --> 00:31:06.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's fascinating.

00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:11.103 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: And ancient ceremonies
were performed there by shamans

00:31:11.103 --> 00:31:15.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and elders for thousands
of years at this site.

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:18.243 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's what we call the stone
altar which was discovered

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
by Onina and myself.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:22.981 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And that is connected
to Adam's Calendar

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:27.018 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or which is Enki's
Calendar both by Enki

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:29.421 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
which actually is
a giant vortex.

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:31.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It's a double toroid vortex.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: When we talk
about Atlantis sinking,

00:31:34.126 --> 00:31:36.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
could it be around
the flood era,

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:38.296 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or is it either farther back?

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:41.600 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: I've got a feeling
it's probably further back,

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.868 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
further back in time.

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:46.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And it seems that the technology
that the Annunaki used

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:50.375 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in southern Africa using
sound as a source of energy

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which I also believe
Nikola Tesla used --

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:56.548 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: -- using and
understanding how to use sound,

00:31:56.548 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
how to amplify it through what
I identified as technology

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that we know today in
the form of magnetron

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.126 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
or magnetron amplifying
technology which is used

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in laser beams and microwave
ovens and death rays if you want

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.167 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to call them that and
secret military projects.

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:16.201 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: They got all
that knowledge.

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:17.068 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:18.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
They built these
giant magnetrons

00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that are 20 meters in diameter.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it's just amazing
when you see this stuff.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:26.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's so obvious, it's
in front of your eyes.

00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And when you recognize it
you go, oh my goodness,

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
we're using the same
technology today.

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:35.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They just use it on a
huge vast, in a vast way

00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:37.355 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that we could never
have imagined.

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.324 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: How did they
get here, craft?

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:42.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
How did they get here?

00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:45.096 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, Sitchin suggests
they flew here in aircraft

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:48.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and that they used water
as a means of propulsion.

00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:52.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So at this stage
that's what it suggests.

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.139 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: That could
be the mistake.

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: That could be
the mistake, yeah.

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:57.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Because it is very clear

00:32:57.142 --> 00:33:00.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that the Annunaki are
multidimensional beings.

00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:01.847 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
They're highly evolved.

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They're highly crafty, they
always have been for millions

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and millions of years.

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:07.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They haven't been around
for just thousands of years.

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:10.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The Annunaki have been
around for millions,

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:13.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
according to some
researchers billions of years,

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:15.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they've been at this
for a long, long time.

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:18.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Do you know how
advanced they must be?

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:20.131 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Unbelievable.

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.499 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:24.603 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The fascinating thing is that
we have the capacity in us.

00:33:24.603 --> 00:33:25.804 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
You said it yourself.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:27.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We're the offspring, we're
the genetic offspring

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:29.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of the Annunaki.

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:33.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And the ability to
have this kind

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:35.714 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of knowledge is encoded
in our DNA.

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:39.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But the best part of that is
that now that we understand more

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:42.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
about the DNA and what
the DNA is we realize

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:45.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that our DNA is directly
connected

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:46.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to all the knowledge
that's sitting

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.026 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
in the morphogenic field.

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.795 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So we can just tap
into it and get it.

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:54.499 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
We don't need to go back and
try to recreate the technology.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:57.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And this I believe is a critical
thing is that the technology

00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.071 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that was employed
by the Annunaki

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:04.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and then abused thousands
of years later --

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; GN: And lost.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MT: -- and lost, but then
used when money was introduced

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:11.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
by the Annunaki as a tool
of control and enslavement

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:14.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
into the human race, when
kingdom was lowered to earth

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:19.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from heaven, we now have a very
direct connection to the origins

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of bloodlines of the
royal political bloodlines

00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:23.094 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that run the world today.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So Marian tablets tell
us when that happened.

00:34:25.664 --> 00:34:28.433 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And we also have the
introduction of money as a tool

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of enslavement by these first
royal bloodline priest kings

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that set up the first banks that
were in the temples of Sumar,

00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and they created
the first money.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.279 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So now we know that the
Annunaki are responsible for --

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.047 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: They did this.

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:43.248 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: -- all this stuff.

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:44.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: They were the
federal reserve of the past.

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:45.951 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:51.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And now we can start making
sense of where we come from,

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.458 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that we were created as
a slave species to work

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:56.061 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in the gold mines of southern
African and then the gold mines

00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
around the rest of the
world because the Maya's

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.566 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the giant Olmec
heads are clearly

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.468 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and distinctly of
African origin.

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:06.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They have very distinct
African features.

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:09.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So it seems that they took these
original African gold miners

00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and they might have taken them
to other parts of the world

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.278 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
to do the gold mining for them.

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:15.146 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
That's one possible suggestion.

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.481 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
But then we also discover

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.616 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that they introduced this
thing called money and they set

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:22.087 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
up the legal systems,
banking systems.

00:35:22.087 --> 00:35:25.323 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And we're still using those
systems of enslavement today.

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.993 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And they're being
used against us.

00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:32.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So what this does very
clearly is allows us to figure

00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:35.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
out what we should not be doing.

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:38.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Are we learning
anything, Michael, about this?

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Absolutely.

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:42.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We're learning that the
past few thousand years,

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and we need to thank
the royal bloodlines

00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:48.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the banking families for
this, is that they showed us

00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:49.848 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that this is not the way.

00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
That we need to find a new way.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.587 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And that I believe is
probably my most recent

00:35:55.587 --> 00:35:58.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and I believe my most
important contribution

00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:01.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from my research is
learning from the ancients

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and providing possible plausible
solutions for the future.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.233 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To say we can't continue
doing what we've been doing

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:11.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for thousands of years because
that's called insanity according

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to Albert Einstein.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
But some of those people

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.574 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that control don't
want to change do they?

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: Of course not because
it's about the control.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's about this taking
control of our planet.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And this is where many
people make the mistake.

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:25.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
They think it's about the money.

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:26.885 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
It's not about the money.

00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:28.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The money is just
the tool of control.

00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.822 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So they use the thing
called money

00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:33.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to keep control over the planet.

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.193 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So once we realize this
we need to go, okay,

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
well if money is a tool
of control then all we got

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:40.932 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to do is get rid of the money
and bypass the money and set

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:44.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
up a new global system where
we don't need to use money

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
where we put people first
instead of the money,

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:51.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and providing abundance for
this planet and for the humanity

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:54.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on this planet because
it's our planet after all.

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We were created to
be on this planet.

00:36:56.981 --> 00:37:00.819 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It might not have been for
noble reasons in the beginning,

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:02.187 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
but it certainly has turned

00:37:02.187 --> 00:37:06.324 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
out that we are now the most
populous species on this planet

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
so it belongs to the people.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we need to put people
first and everything second.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.265 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And this is where I
believe we are now.

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:17.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I believe that the rise of
consciousness is allowing us

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:19.704 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to move rapidly towards that.

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Our DNA is being
activated as we all know

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because Annunaki
DNA is in our blood.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: And it is imbued with
that absolute higher levels

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:30.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of consciousness and
understanding technology

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and realizing we can move
beyond the technology

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:35.954 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because the technology is
actually in our bodies.

00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:37.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Our bodies are the highest level

00:37:37.689 --> 00:37:39.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of technology that
we can imagine.

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:41.693 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: How many planets do
you think the Annunaki went

00:37:41.693 --> 00:37:44.762 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to to do exactly
what they did here?

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Hundreds if
not thousands.

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They've been doing this for
millions and millions of years

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.402 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
so it's difficult to judge.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Pick a number.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.838 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: They just seeded
all these planets.

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.442 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
But the important thing here is

00:37:57.442 --> 00:38:03.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that there's often a very
fine line between the Elohim

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:06.918 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the Annunaki, a
line of deception.

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:10.722 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And, again, because -- and
I need to quickly come back

00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:13.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to the brilliant discovery
of Meho Ledwith

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:16.628 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
when he discovered
that the opening phrase

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:19.764 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the Bible is not what
we're being taught it is.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:23.034 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Because the opening Hebrew
phrase does not have the letter

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:26.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
aleph at the beginning
of that phrase.

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:29.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And when he inserted
the letter aleph into --

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:33.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which is an obligatory letter to
every sacred script has to start

00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:35.947 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with that first letter of the
alphabet, when he inserted

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:37.649 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that letter it no longer says

00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:40.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.986 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
which we've all come to know.

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:47.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It says the father of the
beginnings created the Elohim,

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the heavens and the earth.

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:51.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And that's a spectacular
discovery.

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:55.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Because it immediately
brings Judeo- Christianity

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in alignment will
all ancient cultures

00:38:58.102 --> 00:39:00.538 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and the creation stories
from all ancient cultures

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:02.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that they were some sort
of a primordial source,

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.075 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the father of the beginnings.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.276 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: It makes a lot of sense.

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:08.646 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; MT: That brought forth
the Elohim themselves,

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:12.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the gods of the Bible and
everything else in creation.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take some more
questions for Michael Tellinger.

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:17.689 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
How about somebody over here?

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Yes, ma'am?

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Hello, Michael.

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.594 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Do you think Stonehenge
in England is attached

00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:25.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to the circles in
South Africa at all?

00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:28.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: Is the Stonehenge
in England attached

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
to the circles in South Africa?

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.867 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: Now, that's interesting.

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:30.868 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Maybe, huh?

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:39:32.003 --> 00:39:33.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
What I can tell you is

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.174 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that Stonehenge is an
energy generating device.

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:38.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
There's no doubt about that.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:46.384 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The technology that seems to be
embedded in it is very similar

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:50.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to that of the stone
circles in South Africa.

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:53.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So there is most
likely a connection.

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Annunaki have been
coming here for hundreds

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of thousands of years.

00:39:57.528 --> 00:40:00.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The indication, however, is that

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:04.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Stonehenge is probably more
than a million years old based

00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:06.704 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
on the erosion on some of
the stones in Stonehenge.

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.939 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And this is new information

00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:09.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that nobody seems
to be talking about.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And yet when you go there
and you look at the stones

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:14.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
at Stonehenge and you look
at the erosion there's

00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:18.383 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
like two feet of erosion on
Sarsenns stone where some

00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:19.751 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
of the breaks occurred.

00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:22.353 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And you go, well hold on, two
feet of erosion can't occur

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:23.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in a few thousand years.

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:26.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So Stonehenge must be
extremely old, probably way more

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.494 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
than a million years old.

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:33.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And remember that Stonehenge
was reconstructed in the 50s

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
so it's not the way
it was found.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.269 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
When it was found it
was totally destroyed

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.671 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and just lying there in pieces.

00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:43.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It was reconstructed in the 50s
into what we see it being today.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:50.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So it's difficult to say but
it's possibly connected, yeah.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: You know what
fascinates me, we've got records

00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of events during our lifetime,

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the Civil War, World
War I and II.

00:40:58.523 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Anything that happened
we have records.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
We can go back, we can trace it.

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:07.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What happened with the
ancient civilizations

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:10.768 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
where it just seems
to have ended

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:13.304 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and nothing got passed along?

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:15.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then here we are
scrambling to try

00:41:15.173 --> 00:41:17.675 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to interpret what
happened in the past?

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:21.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
How did it get and why
did it get cut off?

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:24.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, we've got
the Sumerian tablets.

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We've got ancient
Indian and Asian Sanscrit

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and other ancient texts that
tell us very similar stories

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:34.959 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
about the gods that
came to earth.

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:36.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right, and about flying
machines and everything else.

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:37.662 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; MT: Exactly.

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:38.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And the gold, the
obsessions with gold.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So there are a lot of
consistencies in ancient times

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that are becoming more
and more important

00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:47.338 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
as we connect the dots.

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:52.076 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But there's another important
thing about the technology.

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:55.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because if you look at what
all the ancient sites are made

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:56.948 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of they're made of stone.

00:41:56.948 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well, what is one of
the main components

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
of stone is silica, quartz.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.855 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: What is used in the
most advanced technology today?

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.425 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Quartz, silica.

00:42:07.425 --> 00:42:08.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
It holds memory.

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It conducts information.

00:42:09.494 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Fiber optics, silicon
chips and so forth.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The most advanced
technology is silica.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:18.302 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So if we know how to use
silica in its original form

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:21.339 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in the stone why the hell
do we need to extract it?

00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:23.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Just use it in the stones.

00:42:23.074 --> 00:42:25.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And that's what I believe
many people are starting

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:27.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to realize is that all
the information is encoded

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.313 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
in the stone.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:32.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You don't need to extract it to
put it into shiny metal objects.

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:35.219 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
That's an aspect of capitalism.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.155 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You need to extract it
and put it into a thing

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:39.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and package it nicely so
you can sell it to somebody.

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:41.492 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
If you don't need to sell
anything you don't need

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
to extract it.

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:43.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Leave it in its original form.

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The same can be said about
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:48.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know for thousands of
years people healed themselves

00:42:48.533 --> 00:42:50.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with natural remedies
and plants.

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And suddenly the pharmaceutical
industry comes along,

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
they extract the
active ingredients

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:55.106 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
so they can package it.

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:56.340 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: From those plants.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.576 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: From the plants,
exactly, to put it in a box

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
so they can sell it to us.

00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:01.012 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: Under prescription form.

00:43:01.012 --> 00:43:02.313 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes.

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:04.081 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And suddenly they make the
plants illegal and unlawful

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.583 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
so you can't grow them yourself

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.118 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
because you need
to buy the stuff.

00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:10.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So you see how the thing
called money has been slowly

00:43:10.388 --> 00:43:14.926 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
but surely evolved into keeping
us away from the technology

00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:17.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and understanding and the
knowledge of technology.

00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:19.163 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
That's in everything around us.

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:21.933 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In our bodies, there's
technology in our bodies,

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the technology in the rocks.

00:43:23.668 --> 00:43:26.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So I believe that the
silica and the quartz

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:30.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in all the ancient sites has all
the knowledge and information

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of how it was built, when it
was built, by whom it was built,

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:36.414 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for what reasons it was
built encoded in the quartz

00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:38.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and the silica of these rocks.

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We just don't know
how to tap into it

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and extract the information out.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.123 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But what we do know, and this
is brand new information,

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:51.596 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that finally for the first
time we can now store digital

00:43:51.596 --> 00:43:54.098 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
information in real
quartz crystals.

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:57.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And this is new stuff,
brand new stuff.

00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:59.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So when you watch
Superman the movie

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:02.707 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and when he's putting all the
crystals in there whoever wrote

00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:03.774 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that stuff knew what --

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:04.742 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: They knew.

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:05.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: They knew
what they were doing

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:08.446 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because he had all this
information encoded

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:11.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in the crystals and manipulating
stuff with crystals.

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:16.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So I suggest that very soon
crystals will either be illegal,

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
unlawful, or they'll
become very valuable.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So hang on to your crystals.

00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:21.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Like the diamond.

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Because very soon it's
going to be very bad,

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
all crystals are bad because now
suddenly you can store trillions

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:30.001 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of terabytes of information
into one crystal,

00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:31.836 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that's not good
for business.

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:32.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Good point.

00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:34.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We're talking with
Michael Tellinger

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:35.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about ancient civilizations.

00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:37.108 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
How about another question?

00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:38.209 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Yes, ma'am?

00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:40.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about the Annunaki class

00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:43.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and how they had the
slave class and also

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.182 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
about currency and money.

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:50.855 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Wouldn't also an agrarian
society be using food as more

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of a valuable currency
for a slave class?

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean would they have
uses of money or gold

00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:58.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or would they more
likely be wanting food

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:01.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to sustain themselves
and their families?

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:04.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah, my research
very clearly shows

00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:09.040 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that money was not used in
ancient times before the flood.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There is no -- when you read the
Sumerian translations there's

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
never ever any reference

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:17.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to money among the
Annunaki or the Annuna gods.

00:45:17.782 --> 00:45:20.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The reference to money is always
only when you start talking

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:24.055 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
about the beings or the
humans, how it was used

00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:25.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to control the humans.

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:30.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And it's really important
because this is important for us

00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:33.698 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to try and figure out how
we can move beyond money

00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:35.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and beyond the absolute
oppression

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and enslavement through money.

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:42.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Because it's not the love of
money that is the problem,

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.874 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it's the presence of
money that's the problem.

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:47.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Money brings forth all the
ugly aspects of society

00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:49.947 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that we really want
to move beyond.

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:53.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because that is the thing that
keeps the consciousness low.

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
It keeps us oppressed.

00:45:54.552 --> 00:45:57.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It's the hurdle to progress.

00:45:57.655 --> 00:46:02.193 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It's the obstacle to abundance,
the hurdle to progress.

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So the moment you remove it
from our existence it opens

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
up the door to abundance
on every level.

00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:12.003 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We don't need to create
hurdles for ourselves.

00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:15.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We need to create unity, we
need to work in cooperation.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
All our lives we're taught
from the earliest of age we go

00:46:18.743 --> 00:46:20.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to school and we're taught

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:25.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in these terrible indoctrination
camps that are called schools

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:27.418 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
where we're taught that
competition is good.

00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:30.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
No, competition is
bad, it's bad.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Cooperation is good.

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.691 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We should be cooperating,
not competing.

00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:37.595 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Competition on certain levels
where it's friendly competition

00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:39.363 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but not competition
for domination,

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.098 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
for the purposes of domination.

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:47.171 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Competition for the purposes of
promoting unity and cooperation

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to show who comes up
with a better device

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.476 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so that better device can
be shared with everybody

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:55.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and not be used for the
exploitation of everybody.

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.782 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
This is critical.

00:46:57.782 --> 00:47:01.919 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So the Annunaki never used
gold as a form of currency.

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It's a very important thing.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.790 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
The oldest example of money

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.093 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the world is actually a
clay tablet that, once again,

00:47:09.093 --> 00:47:11.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
it's always hidden
in plain site.

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And this clay tablet is

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the British museum
for everyone to see.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:19.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it's what I call the
oldest bill of exchange

00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:23.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that was obviously made
by a scribe in the temple,

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that was the bank,
and was instructed

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.812 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
by the priest king
who was the banker.

00:47:27.812 --> 00:47:30.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And this oldest form
of money talks

00:47:30.448 --> 00:47:34.418 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about eight silver shekels
being deposited by a person

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:39.623 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
into the temple to the banker
in the form of interest.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The eight silver shekels
was actually interest

00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
that he was paying.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.931 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So already then the
priest kings in the temples

00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:49.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that were the banks were
already charging interest.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.201 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: Smart people, right?

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: It's crazy.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:57.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: The ancient Indian
Sanscrits discusses what looks

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:01.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
like nuclear war that
happened on this planet.

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.414 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Can you explain that?

00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:06.217 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, they certainly
had advanced knowledge

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.485 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
and technology.

00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:14.792 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And their ability to manipulate
radioactive materials is

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:15.826 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
very clear.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:18.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And evidence of Mohenjo-daro

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:20.097 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and the various ancient
civilizations

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:24.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in the Indus Valley clearly show

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:28.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that there was nuclear fallout
there that's been detected.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.974 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: The desert is glass.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:31.342 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: The desert is glass.

00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:35.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There's destruction, and the
same in the Sinai Desert, right,

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:38.149 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that Abraham was
supposed to come down

00:48:38.149 --> 00:48:40.384 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and protect and so forth.

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:42.887 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And just the story of
Abraham is a fascinating one.

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:48.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Why suddenly he moved from
Ur all across with a handful

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:54.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of warriors that could slay what
Sitchin refers to as Nar men,

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:57.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a small army of 400 or 500 men

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:59.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that could subdue
an army of 10,000.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.105 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
That's not physically possible.

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:02.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Unless they had
the weaponry, right?

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Unless they
had the weaponry.

00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And the same thing
is then described

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.344 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the Sumerian Tablets

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:10.214 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
when kingdom was lowered
to earth from heaven.

00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And kings were chosen from
among the people by the gods,

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:16.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and they appointed the kings

00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:18.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so that they could
rule over the people.

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:21.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the way they could
rule over the people was

00:49:21.025 --> 00:49:23.661 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because the gods gave
them fierce weapons

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:26.197 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with which they could
subdue the people.

00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And this is how we find
the kingdoms arise.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.637 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Because otherwise it makes no
sense that kingdoms would arise

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:37.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
out of people living
happily sharing everything

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and living in abundance.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:41.278 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And suddenly this king pops
his head out and says, hold on,

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:43.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this land now belongs to me.

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:46.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And you all work for me, and
if you don't have this thing

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:49.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with my face stamped on it
you can't live on my land

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.555 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and you have to pay
me to live on it.

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:53.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's crazy, it's a crazy idea.

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:56.093 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: The stories of Sodom
and Gomorrah and things

00:49:56.093 --> 00:50:00.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like that also to me sound
like some kind of war that

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:01.799 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
destroyed these cities.

00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Absolutely.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And what I believe
was going on Sodom

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:09.707 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and Gomorrah were
probably the first uprising

00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:13.010 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of conscious human beings
that realized, hold on,

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
we're being manipulated.

00:50:14.078 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Enough is enough.

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Enough is enough.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We're being manipulated
by these beings, the gods,

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:20.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
they're oppressing us,
they're enslaving us,

00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:22.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we're going to stand up
and rise up against them.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:25.256 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And unfortunately they didn't
have weapons fierce enough.

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:26.056 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: And they were smited.

00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:28.525 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: They just took them out.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:29.960 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: Took them out, yeah.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: What is all this ahead.

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:34.131 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
What's the future look like
for you, your research?

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:37.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, for me the research

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
into the stone circles is
getting more and more exciting

00:50:40.104 --> 00:50:43.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because we're finding scientific
evidence, the measurements

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:46.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the sound frequencies
that are coming out.

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:50.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Showing us very clearly that
sound is a primordial source

00:50:50.314 --> 00:50:53.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of energy that can be used
in a spectacular fashion.

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And it's a free source
of energy.

00:50:55.252 --> 00:51:00.057 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
We're not burning fuel, we're
not burning oxygen or hydrogen.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It's an energy that's given,

00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:03.494 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
volunteered to us
by Mother Earth.

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And we should start
learning from the ancients

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.032 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and using sound as an energy.

00:51:08.032 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So I believe we're moving
towards an understanding how

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.702 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to use free energy.

00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:13.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And secondly now that we
understand how money was

00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:17.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
introduced and manipulated and
used to manipulate humanity,

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:21.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we can free ourselves from
that total enslavement

00:51:21.779 --> 00:51:25.616 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
through the energy, through the
money, moving beyond the energy

00:51:25.616 --> 00:51:29.920 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the money system into a
whole new world where we live

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.190 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in a world of abundance
and unity.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And I call that contributionism,

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:36.393 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and that's really
what my new book

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:39.363 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and my new research is
moving towards is shaving the

00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:42.566 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
philosophy of a world
without money where we live

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.903 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in abundance, use the skills
and the talents of the people

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to provide this abundance to
everybody instead of hoarding it

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for ourselves so that each one

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of us is a contributor towards
the benefit and the abundance

00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:56.880 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
of everybody around us.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.352 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Only my giving do we find
the absolutely pleasure

00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:04.588 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in receiving the love and
the respect from the others

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:07.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the community is by
giving, not by taking.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.293 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: What's the name of
your new book, Michael?

00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:11.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: It's called
Ubuntu Contributionism.

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: You want to spell that?

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:13.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah.

00:52:13.397 --> 00:52:15.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Ubuntu, well you know Ubuntu
from the software, right?

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:16.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Okay.

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:17.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: Which is also created

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by a South African Mark
Shuttleworth strangely enough.

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:24.508 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So Ubuntu, U-B-U-N-T-U,
Contributionism:

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:27.311 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
A Blueprint for Human
Prosperity.

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:31.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Are we going to
win in the long haul here?

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:35.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Are we going to be able
to fix some of these ills?

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:36.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; MT: I think we're
fixing them already.

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:39.656 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Your show goes a long
way towards doing that.

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:42.192 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It's shows like this, it's
people like this that come here

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:44.695 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that become seeds
of consciousness.

00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:46.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
It's all about energy.

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:49.466 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Once you've heard this
you cannot unhear this.

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.302 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The millions of people that
will be looking at this TV show

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and many of your other
shows that you've done

00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:56.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the brilliant researchers
that share this information

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:59.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and share new areas of
levels of consciousness.

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.045 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
This is the critical thing.

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:04.381 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So no matter what you do,
whether you talk about it

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:06.884 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or not, wherever you walk or
whoever you come into contact

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:09.386 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with you will rub off
this energy on those

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:11.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that enter your sphere
of influence.

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It will rub off on
them subconsciously.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They will automatically pick

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:16.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
up on this knowledge
and information.

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And when they are ready
they'll tap into it,

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they'll then
themselves start searching

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.566 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and start sharing this.

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:26.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But we can help speed it
up by talking about it.

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:30.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So my suggestion to everyone
is be a seed of consciousness.

00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:32.042 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Go out and talk about this.

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.812 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Don't be afraid of your
knowledge and your information.

00:53:34.812 --> 00:53:36.780 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Share this with everyone.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.416 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If they don't understand it
don't let it be your problem,

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
let it be their problem.

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:43.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Let them be informed
by your knowledge.

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So be a seed of consciousness,

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:50.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
help this explosion grow
exponentially and let us move

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:54.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
into a world of abundance
for the people by the people

00:53:54.198 --> 00:53:55.866 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
because this is our planet.

00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:58.268 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: Michael, all of us at
one time are trying to figure

00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:03.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
out who are we, what are we
doing here, why are we here.

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:06.343 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Have you gotten those
answers for yourself?

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MT: I think we've covered
some of them here today.

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:12.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it's a critical question
once again because everyone,

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:15.018 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
as you said, have
asked ourselves that.

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The fact that we don't
have immediate answers

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to those three questions, who
are we, where do we come from --

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:20.257 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: We don't know.

00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:21.325 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: Why are we here?

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:22.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
We don't know.

00:54:22.526 --> 00:54:24.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the fact that we don't
have immediate answers

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:26.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for that makes it very clear

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that we are a species
with amnesia.

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But we're waking up from that
amnesia by DNA being activated,

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
by learning from the ancient
cultures, by realizing

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:40.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that what's happened to our
species is an incredible story

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:43.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of enslavement, of manipulation.

00:54:43.514 --> 00:54:47.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And now that we know that
it's probably what the ancient

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.921 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
masters were talking
about, enlightenment.

00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Reaching the stage
of enlightenment.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:59.563 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Once you know this stuff you
have reached a state of knowing

00:54:59.563 --> 00:55:03.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and enlightenment that you can
take your own conscious decision

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to step outside of
this enslavement

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and free yourself from this.

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:11.975 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And the more of us that
do this the quicker

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.378 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that we'll free ourselves

00:55:14.378 --> 00:55:17.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from this global
enslavement of humankind.

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:20.117 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Will we accomplish
all this?

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:21.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; MT: Absolutely.

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.419 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We're doing it.

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.655 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
As I said, shows like
this are doing it.

00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:26.557 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Millions of people around
the world are waking

00:55:26.557 --> 00:55:28.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
up on a daily basis --

00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:29.826 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's exciting, isn't it?

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:30.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MT: It's extremely exciting

00:55:30.928 --> 00:55:33.597 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because even a few
years ago we were not

00:55:33.597 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
at this level, and
you can feel it.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:37.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can actually feel it out
there, the fact that shows

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
like yours are on the air
now and there are many more.

00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:41.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
The biggest tool
that's been used

00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:43.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
against us is now being crushed.

00:55:43.607 --> 00:55:46.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We are crossing --
or being eliminated.

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.779 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And that, too, was the
divide and conquer principle.

00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:51.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And although there are
millions of enlightened people

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
around the world they
don't talk to each other.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They're scared of their
knowledge and information.

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:58.655 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We're being compartmentalized
and divided and separated

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.990 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to keep the knowledge
to ourselves.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And this is why I say be
a seed of consciousness.

00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:05.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Talk to others about
it so we start uniting

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:11.001 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and creating a united front of
consciousness, a giant movement

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:15.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that is going to start to
emulate what happened in the 60s

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:18.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when this global explosion
of consciousness happened

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.944 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
through the music
and the knowledge

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.480 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of this field of information.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What we now need to do also is
bring this kind of information

00:56:26.984 --> 00:56:28.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and the research that's
happening with the writers

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:31.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the researchers and the
books bring that back together

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:35.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with the music and the musicians
of the world so that can combine

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:37.894 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and start becoming
even more powerful.

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:39.162 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Is there anything
out there

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:43.033 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that you would love an
instant answer for right now?

00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:44.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; MT: Millions of things.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:49.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I think the list is endless.

00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:51.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: What's the one question
if you could get answered?

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:52.542 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
What would it be?

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:55.545 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: The one question
probably would be

00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:02.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to give us visible signs of
the help that we are getting

00:57:02.953 --> 00:57:05.489 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
from the beings of
higher consciousness,

00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:08.191 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the infinite number of beings
of higher consciousness.

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:11.295 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Because many people
are aware that there --

00:57:11.295 --> 00:57:12.629 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Something's there.

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.431 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; MT: Something's happening,
that there's intervention

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
on a very, very high level

00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:18.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and on a very massive scale
that's happening consciously

00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:25.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to save this planet and move
it into a path of ascension

00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:27.344 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
into higher consciousness

00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:29.913 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and saving humanity
from its enslavement.

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:34.017 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
To get answers that this is
really going on on a physical

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:37.621 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and tangible level so
people can get the relief

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:40.624 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that something is going on,
and also help them believe

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:42.092 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that there's something.

00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:45.095 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That it's not just us
that has to work at this,

00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:48.565 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that we actually are
getting help from others.

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:51.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But in the end we
have to do the work.

00:57:51.735 --> 00:57:56.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We've got to do the
talking and do the legwork

00:57:56.707 --> 00:57:58.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and do the conscious
work on this planet.

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.444 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We've got to be the
seeds of consciousness.

00:58:00.444 --> 00:58:02.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We can't just rely on
the help from outside.

00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:04.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: And with all
this are you convinced

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:09.252 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that we are just occupying
this shell of a body to get

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.389 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to the other side and
learn something else?

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:15.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; MT: In some ways
yes, but I also believe

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:18.795 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that what many people
refer to as karma

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:22.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on this planet is not
necessarily what we understand

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:23.367 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
it to be.

00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:27.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I have a belief that the
karma that we experience

00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:30.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on this planet is
actually a karmic trap

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:33.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that was created probably by
the Annunaki and then reinforced

00:58:33.944 --> 00:58:38.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
by other beings who try to
enslave humanity on this planet.

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:44.588 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
While karma is probably an
aspect of free will in the rest

00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:48.358 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the universe where
you can choose karmically

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:51.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to reincarnate based
on your free well.

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:53.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But then you reincarnate
with full knowledge

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:56.733 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of your past lives, being fully
conscious of what's going on.

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
That is not the case here.

00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:00.971 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
When people reincarnate
on planet earth most

00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:04.307 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of us reincarnate not knowing
anything, we're like infants.

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:07.110 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So that is what I refer
to as the karmic trap.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:11.014 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Until you grow in consciousness
through many lives,

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:15.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
sometimes thousands of lives,
reaching levels of enlightenment

00:59:15.152 --> 00:59:17.788 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
where you realize,
come to the conclusion

00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:21.591 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that you're enslaved here, that
you no longer have to come back

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:24.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to repeat this enslavement
pattern,

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:27.230 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that you can release yourself
from this enslavement.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.565 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Great information.

00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Michael, what's your website
for people want to track you

00:59:30.467 --> 00:59:32.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and see some of the
things you're doing?

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.272 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yes,
michaeltellinger.com.

00:59:35.272 --> 00:59:36.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Very simple.

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:38.074 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: And your books are
available all over the place?

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.943 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; MT: Yeah, they're
available at the bookstores

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in the United States
and on Amazon.

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: Well, you do a great job.

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Your research is so important,

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:49.119 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and this civilization
needs more people like you.

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.321 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MT: Well, thank you, George,
and thanks for doing your show.

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.290 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Your show needs to
be heard by millions.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
