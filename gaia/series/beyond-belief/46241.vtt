00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.562 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:10%
You know, throughout
history, mankind

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:10%
has been fascinated with
what could be in the skies--

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:10%
UFOs, the possibility
of extraterrestrials.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's one man
who has investigated

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
many of these cases.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Has spent his entire
career investigating UFOs.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Richard Dolan.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
He is a noted author,
publisher, and researcher.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome, my
friend, to "Beyond belief."

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's good
to have you here.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
What's the name of your latest
novel and research book?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's called "UFOs
For the 21st Century Mind."

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:10%
I guess you could look at
it as a fresh introduction

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:10%
to the entire subject of UFOs.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:10%
I've been working in this
field now for 20 years,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.214 align:middle line:10%
and it really occurred to
me that to some people,

00:01:15.214 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:10%
they might think, well, why?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
What's so relevant
about UFOs today?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Aren't there more important
things to discuss?

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
To some people, I think it
almost seems old fashioned,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
like 1950s.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I think nothing
could be farther from the case.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly
relevant topic.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is
that it really could

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
benefit from a fresh
overview, something

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
that gives ordinary people a
perfect introduction to all

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
of the complexities, all of the
amazing mystery of this topic

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that really does
make it relevant.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love the cover.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.332 align:middle line:84%
I've got to hold this up
for everybody to look at.

00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
What's the method
behind this thing?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's a fun cover.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a Monty Python-esque
sort of look.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:10%
But really, the
idea is that it's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:10%
"UFOs For the 21st
Century Mind."

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:10%
How do we think about
this topic today?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:10%
So it's not so much making
fun of as having fun

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:10%
with the topic.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be a
little bit lighthearted

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.055 align:middle line:84%
in the sense I wanted it to
be approachable for people.

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you did
a good job doing that.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't claim the
credit for the idea.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.762 align:middle line:84%
But a very good
friend of mine said,

00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:84%
you should go with
the Python look.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I love it.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've been
doing this for 20 years.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan, the little
boy, a long, long time ago,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
was he fascinated
with the stars?

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.637 align:middle line:84%
Did you look up there and say,
hey, is there anybody up there?

00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I think so.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I think as a young
person growing up

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.435 align:middle line:84%
on Long Island, New
York, I was always

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
a very kind of active,
sort of curious young kid.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who became
a curious adult.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But no, always interested in,
I think, the deeper questions

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
about what makes our
world what it is.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I certainly had an interest
in astronomy and science,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and science fiction, and
mostly, though, history.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how I
approached the UFO topic.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.142 align:middle line:84%
I went through a long period
where I kind of didn't really

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:90%
care about any of that stuff.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I worked on American political
history, and European history,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
and Soviet history, and so on.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But then in my early
30's, about 20 years ago,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I stumbled into the topic again.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.055 align:middle line:84%
And I guess you really could
say I became obsessed with it.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
interviewed a lot

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.536 align:middle line:84%
of people in the field
of ufology, as you know,

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast"
and "Beyond Belief."

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And Richard, you are
a no-nonsense guy.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes you laugh.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And yes, you have fun.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes down to
researching this and talking

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:90%
You are no-nonsense.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
You're very serious about this.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I try to be.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I think this a subject that
deserves serious attention.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that it's
a big cultural joke.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
it's something

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that we can just
laugh at for people

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
who think that they've
had abduction experiences.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:84%
What you find is that from a
national security perspective,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:90%
this has been a serious matter.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I've been

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
trying to document for 20 years.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And also on a
personal level, you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
find individuals
who have what appear

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to be encounters of one sort
or another, and that these

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
affect them very deeply.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you get a phenomenon
like this that hits people

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
at such a deep level,
I think it deserves

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:90%
a serious type of attention.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 2001, Doctor
Steven Greer and Stephen

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Bassett attempted to put
on a disclosure project.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Timing was obviously
horrible because of 9/11

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:90%
when those episodes occurred.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you find it difficult in
this day and age, where people

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
are concerned about the
possibility of wars,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
economic strife, just
the mess we're in,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to try to create the
relevancy of UFOs?

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as
if-- though I think

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
it's very important to try to
find out where we came from

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and who's out there.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we're been bombarded
with all these other events,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:90%
where do the UFO stories go?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.055 align:middle line:90%
Are they put on the back burner?

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down to what is the
relevance of UFO subject today?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that it
is incredibly relevant.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our secret history.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I look back to the
origins of the Cold War.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We look back to the
presidency of Harry Truman.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we find are, in the
declassified literature--

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and we have some
declassified documents that

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
are available to us-- we
find that this phenomenon

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
of flying saucers,
or UFOs, has been

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
important to the American
military right out the gate,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
after and during World
War II and beyond.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It also looks to me
that the UFO subject

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is a key component
of what we would

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.059 align:middle line:84%
call the black budget,
a black budget culture.

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us are
familiar now with the fact

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
that the American military's got
a lot of classified spending.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:90%
We call that the black budget.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's been such
a culture that it's

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
become so dominant
in our world today.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
all the discussion

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
now about the NSA and the
spying on people and citizens

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think at
the core of that,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
the UFO secret has been one of
the great originators of what

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:84%
we would call the black
budget phenomenon.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Not the only one, but a
key component of that.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about some
specific UFO cases, Richard.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with 1947.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The Roswell case, which I
still find to be fascinating.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Obviously something happened.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you listen
to the government's story,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:90%
it's balloons, it's testing.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
They changed the
story several times.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your opinion.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: At the very
least, whatever came down

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:10%
near Roswell, New Mexico
in 1947 was highly exotic,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:10%
not a balloon of any sort.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:10%
And the reason that
I would say this

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:10%
is simply because there are
too many of the witnesses

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:10%
and individuals from
that time who've

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:10%
described very
unusual materials.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's all in the
material science.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the statement of
Jesse Marcel, Senior, of course

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.667 align:middle line:84%
about the metal that couldn't be
bended or dented and so forth.

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
You would squeeze it and
it would come right back

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:90%
to its original shape.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I had a conversation
with the granddaughter

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.294 align:middle line:90%
of Mac Brazel.

00:07:36.294 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
the farmer, right?

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's correct.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Mac Brazel was the
guy who originally

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
found a lot of the debris.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
from his granddaughter

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is that two months after
Roswell, in September of 1947,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
the Army came back
to their field.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
At least about 100 soldiers
shoulder to shoulder,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
going, picking through,
meticulously through,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.421 align:middle line:84%
the debris field looking
for any little scrap.

00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Now, you
think about that.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be from
even a Mogul balloon apparatus.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Why would they care that much?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And then going into the
house of the Brazels,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
literally emptying
out sugar containers

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and going through the
entire house, looking--

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To see if they
were hiding things?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.833 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask yourself,
what are they talking about?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Obviously it was important.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean it
was extraterrestrial?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, I suppose not necessarily.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:90%
But it was something exotic.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all of the
testimony that's come out,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.574 align:middle line:84%
I think an extraterrestrial
explanation is reasonable,

00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:34.876 align:middle line:90%
in my own opinion.

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course the
reports of the occupants

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
that were found and
discovered there.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:39.054 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, that adds
to the entire picture.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Something was in that craft.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, George.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And people might want
to know that there

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
have been a number, a
large number of stories

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
through the '50s,
through the '60s and '70s

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and beyond that
researchers quietly

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
gathered that had to
do with random stories

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
of military people being shown
films of alien autopsies.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
This actually goes
back to the 1950s.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Or stories of someone telling
his wife, yes, on one occasion

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I did a security detail at
Wright Patterson Air Force Base

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and I guarded
these alien bodies.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they just, these
stories keep coming out.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's enough of them, that
when you put them all together,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.722 align:middle line:84%
you really have to
ask yourself, are they

00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
just coming up with
this at random?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something that
they're really referring to.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's there.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And I think
it's the latter.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Washington DC.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
They've had a lot of
cases there, right?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.847 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't there a flap in '52.

00:09:45.847 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.562 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
well-known ones.

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
important ones,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I think, from a UFO
research point of view.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:90%
1952 was a big year in general.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It was the year that a
lot of these sightings

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
just kind of exploded
across the United States.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Civilians and
military alike were

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
recording all kinds of very
inexplicable encounters,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of military
encounters with UFOs.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:10%
And the real crescendo, the
climax, I think you could say,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:10%
was in July of 1952.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Two weekends in a row, over the
nation's capital in Washington

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:10%
DC, where you have air traffic
controllers tracking on radar,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:10%
pilots seeing visually,
people on the ground

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.276 align:middle line:10%
seeing objects in the skies.

00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And many
objects, right?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.525 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Quite a few.

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Multiple objects.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Attempted intercepts failed.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to I think the
last surviving air traffic

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:84%
controller a couple of years ago
shortly before his own death--

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
he was in his 90's-- a
fellow named Howard Conklin,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
who told me explicitly about
how he had a visual of one

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of the objects and that they
were tracking them on radar.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
was such a big thing

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that it made the front page
of the "New York Times."

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was when the
US Air Force realized,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
we've got to throw some
cold water on this.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't there a
picture of these craft all

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
over Washington DC?

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, there
is a photograph.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.834 align:middle line:84%
And you know, like all
good UFO photographs--

00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's bizarre.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --there's been
a lot of debate over it.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Is that the reflection of
lights through the camera lens?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something legit?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.871 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't really want
to make a total determination

00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But even aside from
the photograph,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
which is a good one,
there's no question

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that there was a genuine
phenomenon that the traffic

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
controllers were not
persuaded, by the way,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
by the Air Force official
explanation, which

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
is it was all
weather phenomenon.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.086 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
temperature inversion.

00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And people just
got all mixed up.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.168 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But clearly that
photograph was published

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.442 align:middle line:90%
because of that event, right?

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not like it
came out 20 years later.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, no.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:90%
You're exactly right.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the photograph is
certainly an interesting one.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's one
of those things where

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.822 align:middle line:84%
I think every good UFO case
is going to have someone who's

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:84%
going to put it in
their crosshairs

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
try to take it down.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But the DC over
flights in 1952 were

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and remain a very
significant one.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's another case
that occurred in the United

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom, in Rendlesham Forest.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
What is that case?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, this is
in late December 1980.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Rendlesham Forest
was near two air bases,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Bentwaters and Woodbridge, that
were operated by US personnel,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Bentwaters in particular.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And what you have are a
number of US personnel seeing

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
what initially they thought
was an aircraft crashing

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.547 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, in
the forested region.

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went
chasing this thing.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They go in there.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And the two lead guys, James
Penniston and John Burroughs--

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and their story is
a fascinating one.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:10%
They appear to have
gotten very close

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:10%
to either a landed or
nearly-landed hovering craft.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Penniston got up and touched it.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Burroughs was very
close behind him.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
that, of course,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is that there was
radiation signatures

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:90%
in the aftermath of that.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.825 align:middle line:90%
They go back and tested it.

00:13:16.825 --> 00:13:18.391 align:middle line:90%
There were--

00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:20.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean after
he touched it, for him?

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: In the area
the following day.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the area, OK.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And there were
traces on the ground that

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:90%
were studied and looked at.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for
a couple of days.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The next encounter, which
was just two days later,

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel Charles
Halt, who was the deputy wing

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
commander, goes out
there with his guys.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He brings a bunch out because
there were more sightings.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And what he saw was, I mean,
just absolutely bizarre.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.019 align:middle line:84%
He was recording it on
audio, and that's available,

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
anyone can listen
to that on YouTube.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But he saw an object above,
a bright object, that

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
at one point shone an
intense beam of light

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
down to where,
unbeknownst to the public,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
there was nuclear ordinance
stored underneath,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:90%
under the ground at that base.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
because to this day--

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.061 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would know, right?

00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: To this day,
the MOD has never

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged that there was
nuclear ordinance down there

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
because the UK
public would not have

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
been very happy about that.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But what he told
two researchers was

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that the beam penetrated
alternate levels

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
of ground and concrete,
quote, "adversely

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
affecting the ordinance."

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Those were his words.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So there was apparently a
nuclear connection to this.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And Bentwaters Base
was a forward NATO base

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:84%
in dealing with the Soviet Union
in terms of nuclear weapons.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So if anything in the Cold
War really got serious,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that base would have
been a key base.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing about it
is that in December 1980--

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
we often forget this-- but there
was a lot of Cold War tension.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the era of what
was called the Polish Union

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Solidarity, kind
of the beginning

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
of the end of the Cold War.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of political
tension going on at the time

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.162 align:middle line:84%
and concern that
gee, maybe there

00:15:03.162 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
a military action.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if these
occupants tried to tell us

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we know what you're doing and
we can shut you down any time.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Because that episode
was not the only episode

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
where craft were spotted
over nuclear facilities.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, by no means.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a very long
history of apparent interest

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
by these other unknown objects,
whoever, whatever they are,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and nuclear technology.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And this goes right
back to the beginning.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:10%
Some of our earliest
declassified reports

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:10%
have to do with UFO
sightings over places

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:10%
like Los Alamos, and Oak
Ridge, and the Hanford

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:10%
nuclear facility in Washington.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.552 align:middle line:84%
All of these were key early
US atomic energy sites.

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And we've got
declassified reports

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
showing round objects,
large in number,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:84%
being seen over some
of these facilities.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.714 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We came into the
club and they knew it, right?

00:16:02.714 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, right, and you
think about the significance

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear technology and
how revolutionary that is,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
what a major stepping stone
that is for human science.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any observing
intelligence watching us,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
they had to be thinking oh gosh,
the kids got the matches now,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and let's keep a
closer eye on them.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
the Battle of Los Angeles.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
World War II, tremendous
concern about the Japanese-- an

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.244 align:middle line:90%
object seen off the coast of LA.

00:16:31.244 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is three months
after Pearl Harbor.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It's February 1942.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The United States is
in very high alert.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.645 align:middle line:90%
This is a serious time.

00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're at war.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And now
we're in Los Angeles,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:90%
which is facing the Pacific.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:90%
On the way to Japan, of course.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
There were Japanese
military that

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
were in the Pacific-- not
in large numbers, of course.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And so there was a concern.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Are the Japanese going to try to
do something to the West Coast?

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
But what the Battle
of Los Angeles--

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:90%
this is not Japanese technology.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
An object was tracked on
radar coming toward LA.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And well after midnight,
early in the morning,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:90%
it's over Los Angeles.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
And by some accounts,
it's multiple objects.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
You've got military personnel
with their field binoculars,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:84%
some of them getting a
very good look at this,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and typically describing it
as a large type of an object.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
There is a photograph of this.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could hear pings
when they shot at it, right?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think some witnesses
believe they heard that.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I've spoke to two
witnesses who were

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
children who actually
observed this.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is
that the US military

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
fired 1,430 rounds
of artillery at this.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Didn't take it down.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
You think what's
going to handle over

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
1,000 artillery rounds
are not go down.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:90%
This thing did not.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did they
miss that many times?

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.082 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They could not have.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:10%
And again, it's an
interesting case.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:10%
And there's been alternate
types of theories.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:10%
One person suggested that it
was kind of a tracking balloon

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:10%
that we put up that
would gauge the wind.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.206 align:middle line:10%
Lighted balloons that may
have triggered some panic

00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:10%
in the soldiers who
may not have known.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.329 align:middle line:84%
But really, when you think about
all of these possibilities,

00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that that's really
the case because this did not

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
come down and it
just glided off.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was tracked on radar
coming to the coast, so what

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about, here?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Not
Japanese technology.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one artillery shell
would have knocked that thing

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No question.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --if it were
some kind of balloon.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.341 align:middle line:90%
So it's an unknown.

00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about "UFOs
For the 21st Century Mind."

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, you
know, what we can

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
talk about UFOs in the
21 century, the thing

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
about it is-- many
people may not

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
be aware-- UFO sightings
have not gone away, not

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%
by any means.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
If you go online, to the
two top websites that

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:84%
collect UFO reports have a
combined of roughly about

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
12,000 reports each year
in North America alone.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.559 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12,000.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: About 12,000
by my estimate.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the MUFON database and
the National UFO Reporting

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's a
whole lot of overlap there.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
They're each reporting 6,
7,000 sightings a year.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And most of them
are probably natural, right?

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.589 align:middle line:90%
Or man made?

00:19:27.589 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Most of them.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, I think so.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But we have to keep
in mind two things.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
A, when you really go
through these reports--

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.787 align:middle line:84%
and admittedly, most of them do
not get a proper investigation,

00:19:37.787 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
so we want to keep that in mind.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, I would
encourage anyone just

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
to go online to the National
UFO Reporting Center

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and just read through
some of the reports.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.155 align:middle line:90%
Some of these are very explicit.

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And some of them have
gotten followup interviews.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that they're
just easily explained away.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is that we have

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to remember that for every
report that is filed,

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.818 align:middle line:84%
there are probably at least
10 or more that are not.

00:20:01.818 --> 00:20:02.734 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That are not.

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.876 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That are not.

00:20:03.876 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
going on that I think

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
it's a significant phenomenon.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the reports
getting more qualified

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
by people who are
police, pilots,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that you would generally
say, you know what?

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
They know what
they're looking at.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, there's always
been a significant number

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of reports that are
made by these types

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%
of qualified individuals.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So pilots, yes, they
are very good witnesses.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And you frequently get stories
of pilots reporting things

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that-- they're in
the air all the time

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and they absolutely
do see things

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:90%
that are not explainable.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.901 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with pilots is
that they feel very constrained

00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
about talking about
this because it really

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
can harm their careers.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Police officers are
some of the best

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:90%
witnesses that we can have.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Cops are often out of
doors to begin with.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They're often called to respond
to UFO reports frequently.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Someone sees a UFO, they'll
often call the police.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And they are trained observers.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk to police
officers about these,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll almost
always find they are

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
very rational, very objective.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't try to--

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Embellish or lie.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, absolutely not.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So they make some of the
best witnesses we have.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
a case when I

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
was doing a broadcast
in Saint Louis.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started
getting phone calls

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.615 align:middle line:84%
from people in the
Illinois area, right across

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:90%
from the Mississippi.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, yes.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millstadt, Illinois.

00:21:25.312 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Correct.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
were police officers

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
who witnessed a large
triangular-shaped object.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And people still
around the country

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:90%
continue to see this thing.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very close, though,
to military bases,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:90%
or Air Force bases.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered
do we have something that's

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
storage that just floats
around the country?

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
If so, what is it for?

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.855 align:middle line:84%
I haven't come up
with any conclusions.

00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, that particular
case you referred to

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
interesting to me,

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and that took place
in January of 2000.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there were a
number of civilian witnesses

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and police officers who saw this
very large, and low, and silent

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
triangular object, perfectly
triangled craft, going

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
over a number of towns,
going towards Saint Louis.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And this has not been explained
in any legitimate way.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You had news personnel
at the time reporting it,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and I remember this.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And they would have the
typical chuckle at the end.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Gee, you know, is it--
with the "X-Files" music,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and hinting that maybe it
was a military type of craft.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But if so, I would
just say, well, that's

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
cool, if you want to
say it's military.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.562 align:middle line:84%
But isn't anyone curious about
what makes these things go?

00:22:41.562 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: What allows
it to be silent?

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
final police officer

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
who saw this object
depart said it took off

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:90%
at a very high rate of speed.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was quiet,
slow, silent really.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then, goom!

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: And then, shhhp, gone.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:90%
What does that?

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Isn't anyone curious?

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if we had it
for military applications,

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
why in the heck
don't we use it when

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
we're in these wars and
all these other strife?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I've asked myself
that question many, many times.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you would think, gee, it
would have come in handy Iraq.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.881 align:middle line:84%
It would have come in
handy in Afghanistan.

00:23:14.881 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh, everywhere.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But I would
suggest that it's

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
very likely that there
are some technologies that

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:84%
are so classified
that they are deemed

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to be too important for
mere geopolitical warfare.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Go back even into the 1980s,
when the United States

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
did an airstrike on Libya in
1986, on Gaddafi's people,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:90%
remember this?

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, the
US had stealth fighter

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
was operational, but
it was classified.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.566 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know about at all.

00:23:45.566 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And the stealth fighter
was not used for that strike,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I suspect because
revealing its existence

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
would've been a worst thing.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was too important
for that mission.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have this example of
the military holding back

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
some of their best
technologies because we

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.586 align:middle line:84%
don't want the world
to know we have it.

00:24:04.586 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a perverse
mentality in a way,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
but it does make
sense in terms of what

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
we might call this
very exotic propulsion,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
very exotic technology.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:84%
What would it be used
for if not for warfare?

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Well hey, we've
got this phenomenon

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
of these unknown
objects that are

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
able to have
extraordinary capability.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, just maybe, we're
using our own versions

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of that technology
to deal with them.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do others, if
its military, have it?

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Do the Russians have it?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.637 align:middle line:90%
Do the Chinese have it?

00:24:37.637 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the $64,000
questions: how far advanced

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:90%
are some of these other nations?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to this.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.622 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
Chinese have done

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
their own reverse
engineering, or the Russians.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have a
long known history

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of their own encounters with
this exact same phenomenon.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
a number of cases

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
where there appear to have been
retrievals of exotic technology

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've seen some film.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Down in--

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't know
if it's real or not,

00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
but it looks pretty compelling.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And when the Soviet Union
broke apart in 1990, '91,

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
this was when a lot
of the leaks came out.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
What you find is when there's
a lot of political strife

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in a nation, I
observe that there's

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.587 align:middle line:84%
a lot of opportunity
for leaks to come out.

00:25:23.587 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.086 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And in this
case in the Soviet Union,

00:25:26.086 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:90%
a lot did come out.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And it does appear
to me that, yes,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
they had their own encounters
with the extraordinary,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:90%
with these UFOs.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many presidents,
when they're elected,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
try to chase down
these UFO stories.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
They want to find
out what's going on.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Carter was one of them.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.091 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clinton
was another one.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.882 align:middle line:84%
Do US presidents know
what the heck is going on?

00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Or are they kept in
the dark like we are?

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I had a
long conversation

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.835 align:middle line:84%
with a very senior briefing
officer, a CIA man who actually

00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
had briefed at least one
of the recent US presidents

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:90%
A brilliant man.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I asked him that exact question.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:90%
How much do presidents know?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
His answer to me-- and
this made a lot of sense--

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
he said some have
known more than others.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:90%
He said, think of it this way.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Presidents come and go.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The career people,
the bureaucrats,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.105 align:middle line:90%
they're there for life.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They stay.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Some
presidents are reliable.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Some are less reliable.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Some are trusted.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Some are less trusted.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
What he said to me was
that Jimmy Carter knew.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.239 align:middle line:90%
Ronald Reagan knew.

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:24.280 align:middle line:90%
George Bush, Senior knew.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nixon knew.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Nixon knew.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a long
conversation with him

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:90%
about Nixon.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.271 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I think
there's no question.

00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Nixon did.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
He said his implication was that
Bill Clinton and George W Bush

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:90%
did not.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.712 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
want them to know.

00:26:37.712 --> 00:26:38.212 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:26:38.212 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
He did tell me a story
that I've mentioned

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:84%
once or twice
about Jimmy Carter.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And I credit this story.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was known to
him that Carter did receive

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
a briefing on the UFO/ET
phenomenon in June of 1977.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:84%
That's his first
year as president.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It was not known to this man
what was told Jimmy Carter.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was known to him that
at the end of the briefing,

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Carter was seen at his desk,
with his elbows on the desk,

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
head in his hands
and that he was

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
sobbing or apparently sobbing.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:90%
He was upset.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, would you sob
because you're just enlightened

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:90%
over the knowledge of it?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe you're petrified?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they told him
something horrible?

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.295 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:25.487 align:middle line:90%
Well, again, we can guess here.

00:27:25.487 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spectulate.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But I think
from that account

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and from a number of others that
I have, that have come to me,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a serious
piece of information.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Something that maybe
someone wouldn't

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.659 align:middle line:90%
want their kids to know about.

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Something that's serious.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So my own guess
is that A, he was

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.240 align:middle line:84%
told this is a very serious
problem beyond our ability

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:90%
fully to control.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.147 align:middle line:84%
And then B, probably
the US president

00:27:55.147 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really have a whole
lot of operational authority

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:90%
over it.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they told him?

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.663 align:middle line:90%
We're being taken?

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:06.246 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:28:06.246 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.645 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
are being taken.

00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I think they could
very well have been.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
If I'm guessing, I
think the president

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.899 align:middle line:84%
would be told there is a
presence of other beings here.

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.232 align:middle line:90%
They are here for the long term.

00:28:22.232 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:90%
They're not going away.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we can't stop.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: We cannot stop it.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have a permanent
policy of secrecy and deception

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:84%
about this-- and very
probably, because I

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:90%
think threats would be involved.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It wouldn't shock me
if someone said to Jimmy Carter,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.016 align:middle line:84%
hey, if you really want
to get cute with this,

00:28:41.016 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:90%
we could do a Kennedy on you.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:90%
You could go away.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, you hear these
rumors quietly being discussed.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.386 align:middle line:90%
Don't talk.

00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation with
another senior government

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.884 align:middle line:84%
person who said, look, you
talk about the NSA having

00:28:58.884 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:90%
the goods on everyone.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They've got the goods on every
politician, whether blackmail

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, to control them.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hoover did too.

00:29:06.672 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh yes he did.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
J. Edgar Hoover was probably
America's top blackmailer

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was, that's right.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.211 align:middle line:90%
For his own little purposes.

00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So there's blackmail,
and then there's worse.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly think they're
not beyond very severe threats.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation once
with astronaut Edgar Mitchell

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that guy.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.008 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's quite relevant.

00:29:25.008 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I love Edgar.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had talked for a number
of years about two ultra elite

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
connections that he had who
told him about alien technology

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and bodies that
were being studied.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.765 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't really talk about
this much anymore, but he did.

00:29:43.765 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I once asked
Edgar Mitchell--

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.674 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I know
you like my work.

00:29:47.674 --> 00:29:49.256 align:middle line:84%
You tell me you think
I do a good job.

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:90%
So can you throw me a bone here?

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You've talked
about these two individuals.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if you can't give
up their identity,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
can you give me a little
bit more information, right?

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And what he said to me was,
Richard, the individuals

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:10%
who came to me did so at great
professional and personal risk.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:10%
And he said, risk
to their families.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:10%
And he said while
they are alive,

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:10%
I cannot and will not
give up their identity.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.337 align:middle line:90%
So you think risk to families.

00:30:19.337 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.004 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, we could
fill in the blanks.

00:30:22.004 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
incredible story.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Richard, people want to
track you on your website.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.023 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:30:27.023 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:10%
I have a website called
richarddolanpress.com.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:10%
It's got information on what I
do, the books that I publish.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:10%
I do publish books by other
very interesting authors

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:10%
in this field.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.737 align:middle line:84%
I think I've gathered together
a nice little stable of authors

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that are very cutting
edge in their own way.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And that's all
on Richard Dolan Press.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for being
on "Beyond Belief," my friend.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: My pleasure, George.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, so the next
time you watch the skies,

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:10%
rest assured that
we've got people

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:10%
like Richard Dolan watching
the skies for us as well.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:90%
