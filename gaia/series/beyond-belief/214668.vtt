00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.193 align:middle line:10%
Bill McKenna, back
with us, the author

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:10%
of The Only Lesson and founder
of the Cognomovement systems.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:10%
Bill has been on the
show several times,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
teaching us things like the
simple method how to bend time.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Today is no different.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:84%
He is here to talk about a
simple method to access 5D

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.532 align:middle line:90%
Bill welcome back.

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL MCKENNA:
Oh, thanks, George.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm so happy to be here because
today is going to be amazing.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually
witness some miracles.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to learn
how to actually do some of it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the 5D system?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: The
technique is actually

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
called the Cognomovement
Square Technique.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And this technique
basically puts you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:10%
into a state where amazing
healing can happen.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, 5D means what?

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: 5D means
a state of being.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So 5D-- for example, if you're
in a state of love, acceptance,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
you feel connected with
the people around you.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:90%
You're not in resistance.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to be
of service to another.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That will put
you into that 5D state.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
is 5D download?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So 5D download is
really something interesting.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It is what my business
partner experienced, which

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
you're going to hear all about.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
It is when you're neutral.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer in fear.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
in a state where

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:90%
you're worried about anything.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:90%
You're completely relaxed.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
You are in a state of
compassion and wanting

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to another.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, what
happens is information simply

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
comes to you about
how to do that.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What puts
us in that state?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So what puts
us in that state, I guess,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to get out of
all of those lower frequency--

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
our grief, our guilt, our shame,
our humiliation, our anger,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:90%
our resentment.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Once all of those
are gone and we

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
have moved into a state
where we authentically

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
want to be of service and
we don't have any real

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:90%
want of an outcome--

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
like, I'd like some
money for that.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I would like some
recognition for that.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be there
and being of service.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
come across this, Bill?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, in this
particular thing that we

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:90%
came across, it wasn't even me.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't come across it.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, take
the credit for it.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: [LAUGHS] I can't
take the credit on this one.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
My business partner, who's the
co-founder of Cognomovement, Liz

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Larson, is the one
who actually came up

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
with this particular
technique that we're

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.687 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about today.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have helped
people with autism.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.282 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That is
something that I guess--

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:90%
we come at it sideways.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is with Cognomovement,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't actually help anyone
with any diagnosed or named

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
disease, whether the disease
is physical or emotional.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
All we do is we help people to
build back their mental acuity.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
We help them with their athletic
or physical performance.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And we help them to relax.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things
that we primarily do.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, then the system
just automatically takes over.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But specifically around
this, the situation

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that happened with autism, was
extraordinarily interesting.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
My business partner, we have
practitioners around the globe.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are
therapists of different kinds--

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapists, psychologists,
doctors, acupuncturists.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
There was one-- they
specialize in different things.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And some of them aren't
even actually professionals

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:90%
that are like that.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But they specialize
in different things.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
This particular
therapist specialized

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
in very severe cases of
children suffering with autism.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
they're often wheelchair bound,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
don't have control over
their bodies, are nonverbal.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As bad as autism
could get, they've got it.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's it.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
she specializes in.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's like an angel because
these are what they call--

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
they aggress,
meaning scratching,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:90%
punching, the whole 9 yards.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty bad.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're out of control.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Out of control.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So my business partner went
over there to Pennsylvania to--

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:90%
she was getting good results.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to see what we
could do to actually get better

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:90%
results with this audience.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There was 10 of these
children lined up

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
that were all in the same boat,
different varieties as far

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:90%
as symptoms.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But she went out
there to help them.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And when she got
there, the situation

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
was really pretty
tense because you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
can imagine being in a
room with a child that's

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
suffering like that.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the room is tense
and just wants to be of service.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But the situation is like
a firestorm everywhere,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:90%
tearing stuff up.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 10 kids
with autism has got

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:90%
to be unbelievable to control.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So what
ended up happening

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:90%
is she walks in the room.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And she likes to describe it.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like it felt
like a migraine,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
like the energy
of being in there.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up like,
for lack of a better term,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:90%
stepping back--

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
stepping back and away from
that chaos and said a prayer,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
a prayer to be of service.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made
Liz say a prayer?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She saw these
children and the parents

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:90%
How can I help?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:90%
What's a way?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And how can I be of service?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And with that
compassion, that she had

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and that pure desire
to be of service,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
a message came
through, like that.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It just came through work in a
square in a non-focused vision.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of unusual--

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
well, really unusual,
because it's not what

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:90%
we do in Cognomovement work.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we work
with focused vision.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have the person to
move their eyes because we

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
can find the problem
area in the brain

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and then help to build
back their brain.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But the children that
are suffering with autism

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
have a very difficult time
tracking and moving their eyes.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:84%
They have very limited
amount of movement.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:90%
So there she was.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And she got that download
to do this work in a square

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:90%
in the non-focused vision.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She helped
somebody named Simon.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Simon.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So Simon was there.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.992 align:middle line:84%
And Simon-- he was the kid
that was really out of control.

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is he?

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: My understanding is
that he was actually approaching

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.947 align:middle line:90%
30 years old at this point.

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not a kid.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, the
rest of the room,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:84%
he was the oldest
one in the room.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But this one was the
one that went first.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, he isn't
a kid at that age.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:90%
But what happened is that--

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the very first
thing is that he was

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:90%
what we call out of his body.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:84%
He felt no control
over his limbs.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was, as his mom
says, out of his body.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:90%
When they would type--

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
they communicate.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:90%
He's non-verbal.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So they would type on a computer
back and forth to communicate.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
He could do it
very, very little.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But he ends up
typing to his mom.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And his mom's like, you're in my
head, saying what I'm thinking.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear what
you're thinking.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
He just wasn't
there in his body.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And we did this test
with the Bio-Well.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And this device, this Bio-Well,
measures the energy of a person.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin Korotkov, he
had invented this device.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:90%
He's a physicist.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it measures the
energy in the body.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He had combined Kirlian
photography, which is actually

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
measures biophotonics--
that's his physics

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
background-- and also Korean
fingertip acupuncture,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
where he could actually measure
each and every little part

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
of the bioenergy field.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would tell you, because
they had mapped it already

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
through fingertip
acupuncture, where everything

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:90%
is in the entire body.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And Simon, we could see
he was out of his body

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
from these tests.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, who is
Colby, another therapist?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Colby?

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:90%
She's another therapist.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the therapist that works
with these nonverbal children

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:90%
suffering with autism.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's take
a look at Colby and Liz together

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
telling us about this
session with Simon.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.453 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>>COLBY.KAISER: My
name is Colby Kaiser.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:10%
And I am a speech and
language pathologist

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and a cognitive
movement practitioner.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
The population I work with is
made of adults and children

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
with autism and
traumatic brain injury.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are non-speaking.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Simon is extremely intelligent.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
If I were to
describe him, I would

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:90%
say he's constantly in motion.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
He spins.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:90%
He touches things.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:90%
He can't sit down.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And he has a history
of some aggression.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
When Liz was working
with Simon, we

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
asked if it would
be OK if we could

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
help support his body so that
he could stay in one place.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:90%
He agreed.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:10%
>>LIZ LARSON: So
at the first pass

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:10%
of doing this, moving the
ball in his non-focused vision

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.735 align:middle line:10%
and asking the brain
to reach, his body

00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:10%
took a big, deep breath in.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And his body relaxed fully into
the person that was holding him.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAISER: Her hands
were over his heart.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And what she said was his
heart rate began to go down.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And he became very
still and very quiet.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So I asked
him if he would

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
be willing to share with
us what just happened.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So very calmly, he
walked over to the table

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
where his tablet was
and his typing stylus.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:14.106 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down and began to
tell us what happened next.

00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
"Slower in the
peripheral was less work.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was easier to
let my body relax.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I felt warmth move from
my feet to my head.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
I felt my limbs for a while."

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The question was asked, do you
not normally feel your limbs?

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:90%
"No, not as a system.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I just don't typically know
where they are in relation

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to space unless I'm
crunched up tight."

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just about working
with people with autism.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a function
that each of us has.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Our non-focused
vision goes unused.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's this massive
piece of who we are

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and how our body
and brain function

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
that is left out all the time.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing us all to
understand more about our brain,

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
about our body, about
our nervous system,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
about our awareness, and about
our consciousness and how

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to create change in
ourselves and on the planet.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it seems,
Bill, that this

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
had an amazing effect on Simon.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The effect
was far reaching.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just him.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
There were another
nine kids after that.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.665 align:middle line:90%
But he--

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
worked on all of them?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: All of them.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: All of them.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing, George,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is what happened after
when they went home.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: They started getting
along with their siblings.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
never had before?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It was not a thing.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
The level of aggression
just dropped.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything around them, the
entire family, was impacted.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And everything calmed down.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saved their lives.

00:14:02.973 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, it was Liz.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was a huge, huge win.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, tell us
about Simon's telepathy.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Simon-- this is one
of the incredible things about

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
him, is that they were
typing back and forth--

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
well, first off, Simon
began to-- instead

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
of only typing a little bit,
began volumes of typing.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to start
communicating, that part

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
of the brain started firing.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But the telepathy,
they had asked,

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
hey, Simon, why don't
you just communicate

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:90%
with all the other kids?

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
He came back and said,
we don't need to.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:55.757 align:middle line:84%
We already know what each in
every other one is thinking--

00:14:55.757 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --and
what they're feeling.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is such
a big discovery.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew this that
they were in contact

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
with each other constantly.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
their telepathy

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is so good that when someone is
not feeling compassion for them

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
or love or gratitude or
whatever, they feel it.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:90%
They know what you're thinking.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a major
discovery not only

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
intelligence level that's

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
so advanced with these kids but
that they are very much affected

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
by us.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This helps
Simon so much.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
He started taking
college courses.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And this one nearly
brought everyone to tears.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
of the college courses.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:90%
He was asked by Liz.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I understand you're
interested in studying.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
What are you
interested in studying?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
And he says theology.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting, theology.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:90%
What aspects?

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Because theology is huge.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And he said, I
want to study love, gratitude,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Three things
he never had before.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Something that is
major to understand the thought

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
process and the feelings
of somebody like that.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
me on an exercise.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Show me what you do.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: OK, well, we're
a little bit far apart.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
But let's see how it goes.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, you could use anything.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:90%
We could use a ball.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:90%
We could use a pen.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Use the ball.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.373 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The ball,
it's pretty good

00:16:52.373 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
little bit colored.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
little easier to track.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.255 align:middle line:84%
So the way this works is
you simply just look over

00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:00.055 align:middle line:90%
my shoulder.

00:17:00.055 --> 00:17:00.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Pick a point
back there to look at.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And stay
focused on that?

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.049 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
And all you're going
to do is simply notice

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.503 align:middle line:84%
this with your peripheral
or non-focused vision.

00:17:13.503 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want
me to follow the ball?

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: No, I want you to
look over on that one point.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.277 align:middle line:90%
But can you see the ball?

00:17:20.277 --> 00:17:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.383 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You can?

00:17:22.383 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right up here.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.907 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, fantastic.

00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, it's coming around

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK, you got it.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.070 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Just look over.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Look over.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what does this do?

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The interesting
thing about this

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is that it affects your
entire nervous system.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It causes you to relax.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
It also causes a release
of dopamine and endorphins.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could I not see it?

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: There we go.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just simply
noticing, noticing the ball

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
as it goes around
and just relaxing.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.112 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:18:09.112 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there some
people who actually could not

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:90%
see the ball?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: At a certain point--

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
we're very far away
from each other.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But there are people who
cannot actually see it

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
because their vision has been
damaged through an accident.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Their peripherals shut down.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So we go to the point
that they can see it.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.583 align:middle line:90%
For you, you probably can.

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what is
this supposed to do?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So what
it'll do is it

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
will cause an involuntary
reaction, a relaxation response.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Your parasympathetic system
starts to become active.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sympathetic system is
the one is that fight or flight.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And the parasympathetic
is rest and digest.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're hypnotizing me.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It feels like that.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:90%
You've started to feel relaxed.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too relaxed.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Too relaxed.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I better stop because
we got to continue

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.183 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the interview.

00:19:14.183 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We got a
show to do here.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Do you feel
anything in your chest,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:90%
a good feeling in your chest?

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I feel good.

00:19:21.822 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That is
as simple as that.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And it does release
those chemicals.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it the experience
when you go on vacation.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
When you go on vacation,
you go to that new place

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that you've never been
before, like Paris or Hawaii

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
or somewhere that you
really wanted to be.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And you get off the plane.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And your vision is
really out there.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
The periphery is way open.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You also had a good feeling
to go along with it.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
This opening up
of the periphery.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
What happens is not only are
you accessing those other parts

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But this really good
feeling starts coming.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
Nicole, the 76-year-old.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, Nicole,
one of my favorite people

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
in the world that I got
to meet through this work,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:90%
in 2016, she was very active.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
She would ski in the winters.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And out of the trees
comes a snowboarder

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and hits her in the
back of the head.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Terrible.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:90%
No helmet, no nothing.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Just wham.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Hits her in the
back of the head.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And she's out.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And everything in her life
started descending into 10th

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.997 align:middle line:90%
level of hell.

00:20:41.997 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Concussion?

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And subsequent to that, she
had another and another.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
She had three major
concussions and never

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:90%
had one before in her life.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so what are the
things that you did with Nicole?

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: So Nicole was in a
state where she was a shut-in.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:90%
She was in her house.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:90%
She was shaking.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
She was nervous.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
She went from all
kinds of relationships

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:90%
to this shut-in life.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I ended
up doing with her

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
is this exercise and
regular cognitive movement

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
to build back her mental acuity.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So she went through a process of
daily exercises, which started

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:90%
to bring her brain back online.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NICOLE BECKER: Well,
after the concussions,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I began to have problems
with my driving.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
My perception was that
everyone was too close to me

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:90%
and that I was in danger.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Very scary.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, maybe
I'm having Alzheimer's.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm going to
be having dementia.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of collapse of
that skill was pretty scary.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I needed to get help.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: And then
what happened to you

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:10%
after you did the
peripheral exercises?

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKER: It slowly opened up.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And what was real--

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:90%
the reality was there.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:90%
I could perceive what was real.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
My natural state is loving
and playful and positive

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and I just want to help.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:90%
And so now, I'm back.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I can
live the rest of my life.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Learning and practicing
the peripheral exercises

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%
opened everything back up again.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I had vision like I had
when I was a teenager.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was confident and capable.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And I could trust myself.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I could react
well when anything

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:90%
happened with other drivers.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So that was huge.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like this
technique changed her life.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That was only a very
short part of the total story.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Her entire life changed--

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
joyful, back to
skiing, parties, very

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:90%
vibrant in every possible way.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about Reese.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wow, this one.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:90%
This is something.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Reese was diagnosed
with cerebral palsy.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Been blind since birth.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Could
not walk on her own.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Had two sticks.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But someone had to literally
walk with her everywhere,

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:90%
holding her.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
she literally was 100%

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
disabled in that she could
not get up out of the chair.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
If she fell down and
nobody was there,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:90%
she can't get up on her own.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
There was absolutely
no balance, nothing.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So this whole situation,
we worked with her

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.640 align:middle line:90%
over a period of time.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Liz Larson, again,
did this and was

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:90%
able to bring her back to life.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is an incredible
story because she

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:84%
had only just very little hints
of shadows that she could see.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
what happened to her,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing short of
incredible, not only the walking

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:90%
but actually the vision.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We've got video of
Reese with your team

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
before and after
they worked with her.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.946 align:middle line:84%
And the transformation
is incredible.

00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REESE GOODHEART:
Hi, my name is Reese,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and I am legally blind.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:84%
When I first met
Liz Larson, I wasn't

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
able to see much, like,
I can only see shadows.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:10%
But when I met her
and I got to work

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:10%
with her with Cognomovement,
I am now able to see things,

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:10%
like, when I drop
something on the floor,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm able to pick it up.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
driving somewhere,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to see trees
on the side of the road

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm so grateful
for it because it's

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:10%
nice to be able to see things
I've never seen before.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:10%
So when I was able
to walk on my own,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:10%
I was able to see the
rocks and the trees.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
gave me independence.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
To just be able to go
outside, go around the block,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:90%
come back home without--

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] going into somebody
else's house, to be able to see,

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that's our garage or whatever,
that made me feel independent.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you actually
saying that the blind

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
was able to see
with this technique?

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: We were able
to bring her brain back.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
We were able to bring her
mental acuity, the brain.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the eyes.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It was her brain.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:84%
We're able to rewire her nervous
system through these exercises

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
so that her brain came
online, and with that, all

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:90%
the other function.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could she
see, Bill, or was she

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
imagining that she was seeing?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It was
very interesting.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting question.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Before we worked, a shadow--

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:90%
she could see shadows.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is, is that
things started showing up,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:90%
like her shoes.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Like, hey, where's your--

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:90%
where's your shoes?

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And she'd be able to say, oh
my gosh, there's my shoes.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe I--

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she'd
know where they were.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She would
know where they were now

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and be able to see the colors as
well, picking out her own shoes.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So this was just nothing
short of amazing.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was with the
simple peripheral vision test

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:90%
that you just gave me?

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That was
one of the techniques.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Then that particular
technique is

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the one that really helped
build back her mental acuity,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:90%
plus she used many others.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:84%
In that clip, if you
go back and rewind,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
you can see her
actually moving the ball

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and tracking it
with her own eyes.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't do any of that.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The eyes were just
all over the place.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing,
couldn't track.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.646 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did these techniques
enhance psychic abilities?

00:28:04.646 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That is something--

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
another kind of
accidental discovery.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
These psychic abilities,
your intuition, if you will,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that comes in many
different ways.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But when you utilize these
techniques, fundamentally,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing is processing
all of the lower frequency

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
emotions, the shame, guilt,
grief, humiliation, anger,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And with that,
one will typically

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:84%
start to see that they're more
intuitive in different ways.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But very specifically,
this particular technique

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of the square, it
appears that people

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
begin to start to see other
information, information that's

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
outside the normal
range, like orbs,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing different energies or
orbs in their peripheral vision.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell us the story
about Liz and the silver wave.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She had an occasional
thing that would happen,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:84%
where you'd see a
flash of something.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people see that.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.768 align:middle line:84%
You might be in
the shower, and you

00:29:20.768 --> 00:29:22.502 align:middle line:90%
see a little blue dot appear.

00:29:22.502 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have
no idea what it is.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.377 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: What it is, yeah.

00:29:25.377 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people have that.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, after doing this
technique, it became very clear,

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
this silvery thing for
her was over on her side

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and then just was always there,
that she had this thing there.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- it
sounds really woo-woo.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But what we know from
near-death experiences

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
is that once somebody goes
through the dying process,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
they start to talk about,
hey, Uncle Fred is here,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and he says, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's right there.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing
it right before they

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.035 align:middle line:90%
go through the dying process.

00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.793 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And this happens to--

00:30:09.793 --> 00:30:10.625 align:middle line:90%
we know--

00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:12.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Countless
people, countless people.

00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
countless people.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And so, what this is--

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:84%
what we believe is
beginning to happen

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
is that they're always
there, but the frequency

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
simply of the range that
we're in is expanded.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So you can see into a
higher range, if you will,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.375 align:middle line:90%
for information.

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anything
about this, Bill,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:90%
surprised you, shocked you?

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yes.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Every week, every
week, I'm shocked.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The amazing things
that can be done across

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:90%
the globe--

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.870 align:middle line:84%
we have these practitioners,
and they come to us

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:58.225 align:middle line:84%
with stories of this and that,
that somebody has helped with.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It's such a joy to
not only help but also

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
have our practitioners out there
doing it where they're doing it.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the stories are
even more incredible.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
that chemicals within the body

00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
are released during these
techniques, the dopamines,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:90%
the endorphins.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: This is a kind of an
interesting thing that we had--

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
we knew that there
was something going on

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.630 align:middle line:84%
because when we did the
work, the very first people,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:84%
they said they had
this incredible feeling

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns out, there's
a bunch of scientific research.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The Princeton Neuroscience
Institute, Columbia, University

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of Rochester, there's
a lot of research

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
out there that the
peripheral, not only

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
will cause a involuntary
reaction for relaxation

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
but also causes dopamine and
endorphins to be released.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you used these
techniques on yourself?

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, I had all
kinds of interesting, weird

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.077 align:middle line:90%
experiences myself.

00:32:19.077 --> 00:32:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What might have been
wrong with you to do this?

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: [CHUCKLES]
Well, I just

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.830 align:middle line:84%
was doing it to see if I could
get any positive outcome.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, were
you ever ill or anything?

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: No.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:90%
No, I was fine.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:90%
But we don't work with just--

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of talking
about helping people

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:90%
that have a lot of problems.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But we work with Olympic
athletes, billionaires, people

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that want an edge because
you can use this all

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.300 align:middle line:90%
to gain performance.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
positive about this in order

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:90%
for it to work?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You don't.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.825 align:middle line:90%
It's involuntary.

00:32:54.825 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You're utilizing your
natural neurological systems

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.872 align:middle line:90%
to rewire your body.

00:33:01.872 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:84%
What we do in the
work that we do

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is we let a person
feel how they do.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We didn't tell Simon,
hey, Simon, you

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
need to shape up
a little bit here,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:90%
son, and get a better attitude.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We just let him
feel how he felt.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that we
work with, whether it's

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
an emotional issue
or a physical issue,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
we don't try to
change people's mind.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.980 align:middle line:84%
We basically changed their
brain and their nervous system

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.347 align:middle line:90%
through rewiring it.

00:33:30.347 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
rewire it, don't you?

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, we rewire it.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people sometimes
stuck in fear and agony

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:90%
with this survival mode?

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I think the
majority of the population

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
is in some version
of fear or anger

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and being divided from each
other right now globally.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind
of a prison when

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you're in it because
when you're afraid,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a self-validating,
if you will.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.150 align:middle line:84%
There's always something out
there to validate your fear

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.230 align:middle line:84%
or validate your anger,
validate your position.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does 5D
generally help people overall?

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The slow process of
moving through the dimensions--

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension, again, is
where all of that fear and doubt

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
rules our lives.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
dimension, we begin

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to let go of all of our
judgments and assumptions

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and to basically begin to have
compassion and love and trust.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.645 align:middle line:90%
But it's a process.

00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
fourth dimension

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:84%
is the training wheels in
between the third and the fifth.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the fifth, when we
get there, what happens is,

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:90%
is that we have let go.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We've let go of our
judgments about ourselves.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.620 align:middle line:84%
We've let it go of our
judgments about others,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and we begin to have compassion.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we get here
to the fifth dimension,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.985 align:middle line:84%
things begin to
happen instantly.

00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:14.990 align:middle line:84%
If I think that
I want something,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.715 align:middle line:84%
then it simply just
begins to show up.

00:35:18.715 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's very, very natural.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I love the story,
I have a friend.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:84%
My friend, who's definitely
in the fifth dimension,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:90%
had a recipe.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And the recipe called for
corn salsa from Trader Joe's.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, I want this.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to have this for lunch,
but I don't have the corn salsa.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get it.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll go back.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.566 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to the store later.

00:35:44.566 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And starts the process of
making a different luncheon.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the door knocks nearly
just a couple minutes later.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And a woman's at the door, and
she says, I've never met you.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm your next
door neighbor, and I

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.070 align:middle line:90%
went to Trader Joe's today.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And I got this corn salsa.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I stuck a spoon in it.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I took a
spoonful of the corn salsa,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, oh, this
is terrible corn salsa.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and see if
that lady next door wants it.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Goes over and says--

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Knock, knock.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:90%
That is the way it happens.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Once we let go, and
we're in that state,

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lived experience,
it comes right to your door.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that?

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Was he doing that, or
was she doing that?

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Something was the
catalyst for this.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: What it
is, is that when

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of our
thoughts and feelings

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:84%
is so very, very clear, we
were absent our traumas,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
we're absent our
fear, our anger,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and this frequency becomes
so very, very clear.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:84%
What happens is it
finds its match.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:90%
All it does is find its match.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It's much like
finding the match.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Somebody can relate to for
all of us, myself included,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is if I'm feeling
a little bit surly,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm angry about something,
and I go to the grocery store,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I tend to have problems
with the other shoppers,

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's the
checkout person.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
have some problems.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:90%
People are going to cut me off.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
The frequency will
find its match.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And so that's all we're doing.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a guest
for Coast to Coast,

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
the radio show that I hadn't
had on in about five years.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, I
haven't had this person

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
on in five years.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I have to call my
executive producer

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:90%
and tell her about this.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get him back on.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, I never made the call.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Except the following week, he's
on the schedule as a guest.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: There.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that happen?

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That was wonderful.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
You're doing it, George.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.850 align:middle line:90%
You're right there.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.140 align:middle line:90%
You're right there.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should people do
the ball situation at home?

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It's best if somebody
does it for you and--

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A professional?

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:10.193 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: A professional, or
there's training available.

00:38:10.193 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
You can become a professional.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But even doing it
where, let's say,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you begin to look across the
ceiling, and down the wall,

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:84%
across the floor, and
up the other wall, where

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:84%
your eyes are forward, even with
that, it's not as effective.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But what you will find,
if your eyes are forward

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and you start to do
that, you'll find

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that you'll have that
sensation in your body,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and things will
begin to open up.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does age have
to-- be a factor here?

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Age is a factor,
but it doesn't need to be.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Our vision, our peripheral
vision as we age,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:90%
typically will shut down.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And with it, literally, it's
not the peripheral vision

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.580 align:middle line:90%
shutting down, it's the brain.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
You've noticed that when
some people get older,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they hold a fixed position
of their opinions,

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.633 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
change their mind.

00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't deviate.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: They don't deviate.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens is, is
that this is a reflection

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of that fixed mindset.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't have to be.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Just like Nicole, who's
partying like a teenager,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:84%
as your periphery--
your vision opens up,

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:90%
it's really your brain.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:84%
All those new connections,
those curiosities are there.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it is-- there
are more techniques to it

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to really get it to open
up, but it's a great start.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does science say
about some of these miracles

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.390 align:middle line:84%
we've witnessed on
the tapes today?

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The interesting
thing about all these things

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
is they have one
thing in common,

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's the brain
and the nervous system.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity, the ability
to make your brain better,

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:84%
no matter what it is, you can
build back your mental acuity.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And with that, all of
the different functions

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:90%
starts to come back online.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
There's simple exercises
that anybody can do and start

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
building back.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.650 align:middle line:84%
The brain typically,
will get damaged

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
through emotional insults
or physical insults--

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or age.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --or-- well, age.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can do
something about it.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You can, if you stay active,
keep learning new things

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:90%
and doing these exercises.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
What you'll do is you'll
stimulate your brain.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can end up being
just as vibrant at 85,

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
90 years old as you
were in your 20s.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.090 align:middle line:84%
My own mother, she
did all of these

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:84%
exercises and does
them everyday.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And she is more vibrant today
at 86 than she was in her 40s.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: But she works.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:84%
She works very, very
diligently at it.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
absolutely staggering

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:90%
how it works, isn't it?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is, it is.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your next project?

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:10%
