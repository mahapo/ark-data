00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, our special guest does not
really require an introduction,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to anyways.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
His name is, of course,
James Van Praagh.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:90%
He's a spiritual teacher.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of the
best in the business.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
He's a medium.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's had consultancy jobs
with network television shows--

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:90%
"Ghost Whisperer."

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
He is one of a kind.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.653 align:middle line:84%
He's had his own
programs on Gaia.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's with us right
now on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
James, always a pleasure
to see you here.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Always a pleasure, George.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I got to tell you.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
When you were on a couple
years ago on my radio show,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast" and
then the calls come

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
in after the interview,
they came in two hours later

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
after you were off
the air with me.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a different guest on
talking about something else.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to talk to you.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.622 align:middle line:90%
They don't stop.

00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It does happen.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:10%
I was on "Larry King" once.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And I had calls in
for "Friday Night."

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:10%
We started a show--

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
"Friday Night Show."

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:10%
And the show ended at 9:00.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:10%
And the calls didn't stop
until Sunday afternoon.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%
So people do call in for it.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it
about the other side that

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
fascinates people?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.962 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
there's a natural curiosity

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that every single person has, of
course, about life after death.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Because they know about birth.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:90%
They've been through that.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.925 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know what
to expect for death.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Is there such thing as death?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And how could he
know more about it?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So they want to-- that's really
what they want to know about.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it scare them--

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
death?

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think for a
lot of people who don't know

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:90%
about it, it does scare them.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I think ignorance is bliss.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I think knowledge is power.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think through
the work that I've done

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and for myself as well, I'm
not afraid of death at all.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to it when
it happens, because it's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.443 align:middle line:90%
our graduation to go home.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Because this isn't our home.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
This is just our
temporary station here.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's our time
to go home when we graduate.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.578 align:middle line:90%
Death is graduation.

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're occupying
a hotel room right now--

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --before
we go home, right?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.885 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting in a car.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
James Van Praagh story.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:90%
How did this all happen?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This
all started with me

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little boy.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I used to see
spirits around people

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
all the time, just like in the
movie the "Sixth Sense" where

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.155 align:middle line:90%
I'd see spirits standing there.

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see dead people.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see dead people.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I used to see
them all the time.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I used to say to
my mother and father,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I see so and so standing
there-- my grandfather.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is how he looks.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And is that him?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.623 align:middle line:90%
That's him, but he's dead.

00:02:38.623 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't see him.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I could
see him right there.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And in grade school,
I used to have--

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
gosh, kids come through windows
through the grade school

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and talk to me about things.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kids-- on?

00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
had passed on.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I once in grade school
went to a Catholic school.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that I
walked up to my teacher,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and she was a nun.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.123 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, your son
just broke his leg, but it's OK.

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
He's able to walk,
but he broke his leg.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
But he'll be able to walk.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:90%
He's OK.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you that.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said go
back to your seat.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And five minutes later,
the other principal

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
came in and called
her out of the room.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
She comes back in and she
said, James, come here.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And she says, how did you
know my son broke his leg?

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The soccer ball went into
the middle of the street,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:90%
and he chased it.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And a car hit him, but he's
OK-- just broke his leg.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And I started crying,
because I thought

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I caused that to happen.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I had the thought,
I caused it to happen.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You thought
you manifested it.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, God gives certain
people certain abilities

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
or whatever she would
say to a six-year-old.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said one day maybe
you'll use it to help people.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And really from that point on,
I did see spirit regularly.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was saying prayers
with my mother every night.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I said to my mom,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
who are those people
at the end of the bed

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
with the lights around them?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
those are God's angels.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:90%
You see them, too.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell
everybody about that.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody
will understand it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So I did those.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your mom was right.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.313 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And mom was right.

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
to the age around 14.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I stopped seeing them.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.213 align:middle line:84%
12, 14-- puberty started,
so something else started.

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So my mind
was elsewhere, obviously.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to a seminary--
went to a preparatory

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.555 align:middle line:90%
seminary--

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.885 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --at
the age of about 14,

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
15 to become a priest, because
I was going to become a priest,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.554 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Father van Praagh.

00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Father Van
Praagh, because I wanted

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:90%
to serve people in some way.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I had to do that.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was the seminary.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.377 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting.

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I was in a seminary.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing--

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.267 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'd call
it a meditation.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.965 align:middle line:84%
You're by yourself
in the sanctuary.

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:90%
You're by yourself.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I heard spirits say to
me, you are much bigger than--

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
God is much bigger
than these four walls.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.565 align:middle line:84%
You must find God
outside these four walls.

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So I quit the seminary-- went to
a New York public high school.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that?

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.878 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just like that.

00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:90%
That was the beginning.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to become--

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to become a
situation comedy writer,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
because I'm funny.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
So I thought I would do that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I moved to California to
get my degree in broadcasting,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
which I did in San Francisco and
then moved down to Los Angeles.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And through a series
of different jobs,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
temporary jobs, and
so forth, I met a lady

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
at the William Morris Agency
in the basement, not--

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good agency.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --in the mailroom.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
In the basement, not
even the mailroom.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you
want to see a medium?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.343 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is a medium?

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's somebody
who talks to dead people.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I really
don't believe in that,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up
kind of Catholic.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.367 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
belief system per se,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know if
I believe in that.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'll go with you
anyway-- just to humor her.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I walked
into this man's apartment

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
in Manhattan Beach,
he looked at me.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.472 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're a medium.

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, thanks.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was a small,
but thank you very much.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said in two years'
time, the spirit people

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
are going to use you to help
change the consciousness

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.133 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just want
to be a sitcom writer.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I want don't change the
consciousness of the planet.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, this
is what your destiny is.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And he went and gave a
reading to me, a session.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And everything he
said made sense

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and some really weird
incredible details

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
of people that passed over.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:90%
So it got me thinking.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I went to-- but
was then called,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
as you know, the
Bodhi Tree, which

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.412 align:middle line:90%
is a new age bookstore in LA.

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And I went every weekend and
read everything I could find--

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything you could.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --about
the paranormal,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and life after death,
near-death experiences.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And I started meditating.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I started meditating just
to be centered, to center myself

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and to have a clear
idea about what I

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.073 align:middle line:90%
wanted-- a future with my life.

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
that time that I

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:84%
started seeing colors around
people known as the aura.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The aura,
like Edgar Cayce.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like Edgar Casey.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing
the aura and I just--

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
it was just something I knew.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.992 align:middle line:90%
And then years passed.

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I was working at Paramount
Studios at the time,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
doing contracts
for their TV shows.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And this co-worker
walked into her cubicle.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.117 align:middle line:84%
And besides her, I saw
her dead grandmother.

00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And the dead grandmother
looked right at me.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.992 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically, she
said I'm her grandmother.

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Idaho.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.908 align:middle line:84%
And we made a
footstool together.

00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Tell her about the
house and the footstool.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And tell her I love
her and I'm in heaven.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I asked the girl.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's
my grandmama.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
She lives in Idaho.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.683 align:middle line:84%
I used to visit
her every summer.

00:06:54.683 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
She taught me knitting
at the end of her life.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.297 align:middle line:84%
We made a footstool
cover together.

00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And she made a promise
that she would come through

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.745 align:middle line:90%
to me if she could from heaven.

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%

I ran out of Paramount--
ran right out.

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my apartment not
knowing what to do, because--

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I was scared.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%

you forget about what

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:90%
you did when you were a kid?

>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, I did.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I was in a whole
different mindset.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.905 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know who to call.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So the only one I could--
because who can you

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
call and tell this to?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So I called up this
man, Brian Hurst,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
who was the medium who
I had seen years before.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Brian,
I'm freaking out,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.012 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know what
to do with this information.

you remember the prediction

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit world
that in two years' time,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.748 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be changing
the consciousness of the world?

00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, yes.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%

was two years ago today.

change the world.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I did.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I quit Paramount.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And I studied under Brian for
many years in development.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:90%
And I started doing the work.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And I quit Paramount.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how the
universe will give us tests.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
The universe tests
this every day.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big test, because
it was money, and security,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was either that
or what was in my heart--

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the love in my heart and
that feeling in my heart.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.545 align:middle line:84%

sense of healing people

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
So here's one for grounding.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.367 align:middle line:84%
I just want you again to--
you can sit down for this.

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I find it better sitting
down instead of standing.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You can do it standing, but
for this particular grounding

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
exercise, I would
just be sitting here.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to use
the breath again.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And the breath--

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to use the
breath by a cleansing breath

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.263 align:middle line:90%
in and out.

00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
cleansing breath,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
that can be a sense of waterfall
coming over you and through you

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and exhale.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.688 align:middle line:84%
And energy that doesn't
serve you, that's great.

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the grounding,
I'm just going

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to use my imagination again.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.685 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to envision
that I am a tree.

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to envision a tree.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale, I want you
to go to the base of that tree

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that you're
the trunk of that tree.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And the roots of the tree go
all the way down to Mother Earth

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and holds you down
to Mother Earth.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
She's connected with you.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
You are connected with her.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So the more you inhale,
you're going to become aware

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%
of these roots--

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
are all the way down,
all the arteries

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
going down into the ground
and feeling that connection.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.341 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
imagine I'm a tree--

00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
your trunk.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Just imagining a tree
connecting all the way down.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:90%
All the way down.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.795 align:middle line:84%
And also, your energy
goes out of your feet,

00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to Mother Earth.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You can see it that way, that
you are completely grounded

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.875 align:middle line:90%
and held together, structured.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.458 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's
so much more to it.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- that clip
is just one of so many.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:90%
It's important to be grounded.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, any type of work we do--

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
no matter what type of work
we do, we got be grounded.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.562 align:middle line:90%
We got to be.

00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I find most people,
George, are in their heads.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.353 align:middle line:84%
They're always thinking,
thinking, thinking,

00:11:45.353 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
thinking, because we've
been programmed that way.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But if we get into
what I call the heart--

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:90%
from the head to the heart--

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:90%
the heart is where the soul is.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's our true essence.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And if we can
make our choices in life

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.353 align:middle line:84%
from our soul point of view, the
easier those choices will be.

00:11:58.353 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more accurate
they'll be for us.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What I have
noticed about you,

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:04.267 align:middle line:84%
James, is that you
actually care about people.

00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
you're so funny.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.403 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:90%
And it shows.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.605 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're great.

00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:10.372 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for saying that,
because it's a compliment.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And not many people
have said that,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
but I was once working at a
school with other teachers,

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
other mediums.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was working with
this couple of students.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And I was working with them.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.405 align:middle line:84%
And another medium
came by to me.

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And he whispered in my ear.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.775 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you really care.

00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
of course, I do.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hello?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hello?

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I really care.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
a lot for someone

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to open themselves up to be
vulnerable, self-discovery.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It could be scary
for some people,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know
what you're going to get.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.763 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of that
fear stuff going on.

00:12:47.763 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So you really got to
help them that way.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you can demonstrate
to them that you really

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
care for them, that you're
really involved with them,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
then they'll trust you
and open up for you.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to give our
viewers just a little example

00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:90%
of this caring about you.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Because James was on the
radio show "Coast to Coast AM"

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
several years ago.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And during that
interview on the radio,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
he invited me to one
of his live events

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that he was having in
Los Angeles at the time

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with the individual that he
had brought in from London.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to the event.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And he introduced
me to the crowd.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
doing his thing.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed about people
that really got close to you--

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
they started crying.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.252 align:middle line:90%
It was emotional for them.

00:13:32.252 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
many people do.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Many people do.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:90%
They feel the love.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't say it's all me.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just a vessel.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But the vessel is
unconditional love,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's what love is about.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Love never dies.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.688 align:middle line:84%
So our loved ones are
around us all the time.

00:13:46.688 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And that love that
they have for us--

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:84%
they love us for
just who we are.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:90%
There are no conditions.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:90%
So I think people feel that.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
As you get close to the
energy of the vessel,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
someone who described it,
is they feel that love.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's about.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it ever
been a burden for you?

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.657 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
had a spirit come

00:14:03.657 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:90%
through when you're sleeping?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.837 align:middle line:84%
James, James, I've
got to tell you this.

00:14:06.837 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And you just can't--

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --sleep?

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The only
burdens I've had are--

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm more afraid of the
living than I am of the dead,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the truth.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The living have been a
little hard to deal with.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Because the living don't know.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
They're ignorant about
the subject matter.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, if they knew
more about the subject matter--

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:90%
and listen.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not like a regular
celebrity or a rock star.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I am-- something
special going on.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're close.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're close.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.285 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So when
I go on a plane--

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
at my last plane ride I had, the
flight attendant recognized me.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And introduced himself,
which was very nice.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other flight
attendant-- thank you very much.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And then they both came back.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the captain
knows who you are, too.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.325 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like to invite
you to dinner afterwards--

00:14:43.325 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's cool.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --when
we land in San Diego.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, thank you.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate it, but I
really can't do that.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd feel safe on a
plane with you, by the way.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to be
on a plane, I want

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.355 align:middle line:84%
to be on with Van
Praagh, a medium.

00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I've had a lot
of people say that to me.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.142 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're on this plane.

00:14:56.142 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Good, I'm safe.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'll know.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I go on a plane and I
know when it's sick.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%
I call it sick.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my friend Lynn
Probert from England, also.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:90%
We were meeting at JFK.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was during the
summer two years ago.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And we got on a flight.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was going to California.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I said it's a sick plane.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
She goes, what do you
mean a sick plane?

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I said it's not going
to be taking off.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, to make a
long story short,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
six hours later,
it never took off.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We had to sleep
in a hotel and go the next day.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
probably a good thing.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's a good
thing, because it ended up

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.023 align:middle line:90%
in Minneapolis, so there you go.

00:15:26.023 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were a consultant
on "Ghost Whisperer."

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I actually
created this show.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You developed it?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I created
this show "Ghost Whisperer"

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:10%
based upon--

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:10%
I did a movie for CBS
called "Talking to Heaven"

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:10%
based on my first book.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.910 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
Ted Danson played me,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:10%
because we look so
much alike, of course.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And the movie did very,
very well for CBS.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
That was when they
did a mini series.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they made another
movie with Eva Longoria.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And that did well.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And then Nina Tassler,
the head of the network,

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.938 align:middle line:90%
said, can you make a series up?

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you come up with
some kind of a series?

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that time, I knew Mary Ann
Winkowski, who we both know,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
who was from my
TV show, "Beyond."

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about, what about
a show about spirits that get

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.972 align:middle line:84%
caught up and they don't
move onto the light?

00:16:03.972 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's how
"Ghost Whisperer" began.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So I literally interviewed
the head writer

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
on the show and the producers.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.387 align:middle line:84%
And I brought the staff
together, team together.

00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And we did the show.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's lasted five years.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It lasted.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.378 align:middle line:84%
It's still in syndication,
still seen throughout the world.

00:16:17.378 --> 00:16:18.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Would you consider yourself,
in addition to a medium, James,

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:90%
a psychic or intuitive?

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
every medium is a psychic,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
but not every
psychic is a medium.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So every single person is able
to psychically, if you will,

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.453 align:middle line:84%
connect or be instinctive
about other people's energy.

00:16:33.453 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
When you meet somebody, you
feel a certain way about them.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Or you go to a certain
place, and you feel

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a certain way about the place.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I think as we're
born as children-- as babies,

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.312 align:middle line:84%
there's a natural
connection with our mothers.

00:16:44.312 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
There's an instinctual
connection--

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.517 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
--with their mother,

00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:84%
so everybody is psychic,
which can be developed.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Mediumship-- every medium
is very, very psychic--

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:90%
have to be.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But then mediumship
is not only psychic,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but you have to open
up yourself to a higher

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:84%
vibration of energy, I
guess you'd call it--

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.243 align:middle line:90%
your soul self.

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the soul is the mind.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:90%
The mind is the soul.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And you have to raise your
frequency to that level

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
and sustain that level
of power-- we call power.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then be able to be the
interface between the spirit

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.352 align:middle line:90%
messages.

00:17:14.352 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And the spirits come through.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:90%
It's mind to mind communication.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Because the soul is the mind.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So from their mind, they're
sending impressions, thoughts,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.347 align:middle line:90%
feelings, memories, emotions.

00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And the mind of the medium has
to then translate that and give

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.142 align:middle line:90%
it out to the public.

00:17:28.142 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the difference
between the two.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.345 align:middle line:84%
So not every psychic is a
medium, but every is a psychic.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
would see dead people

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:84%
when you were a youngster,
did you think they were dead?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Or did they look alive to you?

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I didn't
know what dead was.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know there was death.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, you
would see them, right?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you could have
put your hand through them,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:90%
They weren't there.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
For a little kid who's really--
children are always learning,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
but based upon their
experiences around them

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
as-- that's how they
measure their life.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And for me, they were just
very real beings with colors.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And every living person--

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd see auras around them,
so I though everybody

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:90%
could see those things.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I remember
playing with my neighborhood

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:90%
playmates.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you see
that guy over there?

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was very confusing.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:90%
How come I can see them?

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.778 align:middle line:90%
They can't see them.

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
you get the gift--

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:90%
the mediumship?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think that a
mediumship runs in families.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hereditary.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's got to be genetic.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.915 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's genetic.

00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather on
my mother's side--

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.935 align:middle line:84%
he used to say to
my grandmother,

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
you better set up another
place on the table,

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
because there's going to
be someone here at 5:15.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the
neighbor would show at 5:15.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Or my mother-- my grandmother
on my father's side

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:90%
just to read my tea leaves.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:90%
So it runs in families.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.815 align:middle line:90%
It tends to run in families.

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you train
someone to be a medium?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.633 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, that's
what I do in my school online.

00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a JVP School
of Mystical Arts.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.523 align:middle line:84%
I have a certification course
for mediumship 1, 2, and 3.

00:18:46.523 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And they go through the
basic grounding works,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:90%
fundamentals of mediumship.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, I think, if
I could say it personally,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the best online
schools of mediumship

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and psychic development
that exists.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And I go through.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very intensely
involved in it.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
There are over 60
videos per course.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's huge.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Huge.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I do Zoom calls
with everybody.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the third
mediumship level-- you

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
have to audition--
actual audition with me.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And you get to work with me
out on stage and go with me,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
so I cover everything
in that school.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%
So I cover transformation.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I have 28th day
of transformation,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.652 align:middle line:84%
a day in the spirit
world, how to meditate,

00:19:21.652 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:90%
how to ground yourself.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't technology
amazing, James?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Amazing.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I never thought that I
would be able to do this,

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
but this is my legacy of--

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, look how much
travel time it has probably

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:90%
saved you--

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Quite a bit.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --when you
can do everything

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
on either YouTube, or on your
website, or direct to people

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and stream it them.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.142 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's quite a bit.

00:19:41.142 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Quite a bit.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I used to
have a show called

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond," which we're going
to start streaming now

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that's good.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's another way
of teaching people.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been scared as a medium?

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that has
happened that scared even you?

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One thing
happened in the very beginning

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of my career, I
guess you would say.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
My career is spanning
close to 40 years.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm old, George.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did you do?

00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:05.397 align:middle line:90%
Start when you were two?

00:20:05.397 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I guess
I was in my 20s.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was called into a
house in Beverly Hills.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And what it was, was--

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
it was a lady who was
trying to build this house.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't build it.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And all these contractors quit,
because they would do something

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
in the pipes.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day the
water would be running down.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.213 align:middle line:90%
The pipes would be broken.

00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Lighting would happen.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Someone would come and fix that.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:90%
That'd be broken.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:90%
They never did fix the house.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:90%
And that comes a little scary.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But I tuned into it
and figured it out.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.253 align:middle line:84%
And what it was-- now,
this is really weird.

00:20:36.253 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I said there was a man that
lived two doors down who

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:90%
was a doctor.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, there was?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we found out
that that doctor was

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%
involved with organized crime.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
that some people

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.887 align:middle line:90%
were killed at that house.

00:20:48.887 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And that guy that was
killed at that house--

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and there were one
or two people--

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
they were kind of stuck
where they wanted people

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.135 align:middle line:90%
to know about how they died.

00:20:56.135 --> 00:20:57.385 align:middle line:90%
And that was one scary thing--

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is kind of scary.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.805 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --to happen.

00:20:58.805 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were going to say
it was Bugsy Siegel's house.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Although, I've been
around there, so yeah.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got a program
on Gaia that they have.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Spirit Talk."

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: "Spirit Talk."

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An amazing show.

00:21:11.152 --> 00:21:12.355 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some of that.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I just want you

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:90%
to close-- put your arms down.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
You're right here with me now.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:10%
Get back into your heart space.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:10%
Fabulous.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And now, so you've been
opened up beautifully

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:10%
by these beings
that are around you.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And I just want you
to feel whatever

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:10%
you feel-- a male or a female.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:10%
Or what do you feel
with your heart?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:10%
Because you're such
an emotional person.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Definitely a
male coming through.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
male coming through.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:10%
So a male coming through.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:10%
And what does that
male feel like?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:10%
>> He feels older.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.398 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He feels
like an older male

00:21:44.398 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:10%
and older meaning what, 60, 70?

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:10%
>> No, 80s.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.065 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 80s?

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:10%
So an older male--

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:10%
80s.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:10%
What does he feel like?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.673 align:middle line:10%
>> He feels kind of
stocky, but not very tall.

00:21:52.673 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stocky,
but not very tall.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:10%
OK, good.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Broad shouldered.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Broad shouldered?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.493 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:21:57.493 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:10%
What's his personality like?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:10%


00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.167 align:middle line:10%
>> He comes across as kind of
harsh, but he's really not.

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So he's
harsh, but inside he's

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:10%
soft with the exterior
of being hard.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.508 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, OK.

00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:10%
And give him a voice now.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, you want to give
this man a voice.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.808 align:middle line:10%
>> His voice is very gruff.

00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very gruff?

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:10%
Very gruff.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Long upper body, short legs.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Long
upper body, short legs.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.743 align:middle line:10%
And did he pass away
inside or outside?

00:22:25.743 --> 00:22:26.543 align:middle line:10%
>> Inside.

00:22:26.543 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Inside?

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:10%
And was he on a bed or
was he sitting down?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.985 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this
man was in a bed.

00:22:31.985 --> 00:22:33.235 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was in a bed.

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:10%
OK, so great.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:10%
So just go repeat what
you get to yourself.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:10%
I have a man here.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And just repeat it, honey.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:10%
A man here.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I have a man here
who is in a bed.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Bed.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:10%
And he's older.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:10%
>> He's definitely older in
his 80s, probably mid-80s.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mid-80s.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:10%
He feels very gruff.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Very gruff, even at
the end, but wasn't.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.540 align:middle line:10%
He probably came across
as very ungrateful,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:10%
but he's very grateful.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very grateful.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:10%
And he obviously loves
somebody here in this audience.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.232 align:middle line:10%
And you get a feel where
this man wants to go toward--

00:23:04.232 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:10%
that side of the
room or that side?

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I think I'm over here.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You want to go
over this side of the room.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:10%
OK, good.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:10%
So we're drawing the energy
to the left side of the room.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:10%
If you want to turn and face--
see that side of the room--

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:10%
great.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.293 align:middle line:10%
And do you feel anything around
here where want to go to?

00:23:17.293 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm here somewhere.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're right here.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:10%
So the information
that was said so far--

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.555 align:middle line:10%
does either one of
you understand that?

00:23:22.555 --> 00:23:23.355 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Anybody on this side
understand that?

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:10%
She understands that.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I can see his face.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
can see his face.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Describe it.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Perfect.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, his face
is more square.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:10%
I see age spots along here.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Gray hair, but olive-toned skin.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that's
our grandfather.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's grandpa.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:10%
>> It could be.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How cool is that?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
That's pretty cool.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:90%
My hair was darker, too.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way I work
with students, anyone,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and how they begin
to feel the spirit

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and how they build
up that contact.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And that goes on
further and further.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And a really great message
comes through with that.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure does.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And people can watch
"Spirit Talk" on gaia.com.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Gaia.com.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.097 align:middle line:90%
Watch all the episodes.

00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:90%
They're right there.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:24:05.847 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You could tell the
empathy of people,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
too, when they hear you
talking to somebody like that.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
draw it out of them.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes,
because it's love work.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It's heart work.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the
spirit people come in

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is because they
love that person.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason someone--
they hear about someone

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:90%
is because they love them.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.545 align:middle line:90%
So love, like life, never dies.

00:24:24.545 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So you're working
with love, and that's

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.978 align:middle line:90%
what has to be demonstrated.

00:24:27.978 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a spirit, James,

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
go, tell her the money is
under the mattress or something

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:90%
strange like that?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I rarely would do
that sort of thing.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was kind of a joke,
but it ended up being real.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it was real.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I was at Belmont
Park years ago with my brother.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The horse race?

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The horse race.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, on Long Island.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And there was a family reunion.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And my brother said,
listen, here's a race.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
We have all these horses here.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Which one would you go
first, second, third, fourth?

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.388 align:middle line:84%
I said, Michael, I don't
do that sort of thing.

00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:58.717 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but if I would,
I'd go 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:24:58.717 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't listen to me, and
they all came in the same way.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that happened.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The--

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also had
spirit come through once.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:84%
A lady by the name of
Magda up in Topanga Canyon

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Her husband had died.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Her husband actually had the
patent for Samsonite luggage.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she was
a good client of mine.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.388 align:middle line:84%
I went to her house
one Sunday afternoon.

00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And she said, James,
I've lost a paper.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I need a file.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Where's my paper?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.067 align:middle line:90%
I got to get this paper.

00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell my husband--

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
or ask my husband where
this paper would be?

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.297 align:middle line:90%
And I concentrated.

00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And it came through.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And he actually brought me
downstairs to the basement.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's in the
third filing cabinet--

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --third
cabinet, second door down.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And she found it.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There it was.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
souls at this point?

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Souls?

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I think that we're all souls.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.203 align:middle line:90%
Many people ask me this.

00:25:48.203 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we are in
a human level here.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So our comprehension
of a soul is

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:90%
from the human point of view.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that the analogy
I like to use as a soul is

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:90%
like the bright big round sun.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I think our souls are
a big round sun, right?

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one part
of your soul, right?

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So this body is one
part of the soul.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that 20% of your
soul is inside the body.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:90%
80% is outside of the body.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that 80% could
be living different lifetimes,

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
experiencing different
things, all at the same time

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.645 align:middle line:90%
that this 20% in the human--

00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a good analogy.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --is
experiencing it.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reincarnation?

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Reincarnation
for sure, without a doubt.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can be
reincarnated all the time.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we do now
in the human-- our actions,

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, our deeds affect
the past and the future.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a hell, James?

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.557 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
we create our hell based

00:26:41.557 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
upon how we live our lives, and
the thoughts that we give out,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:90%
and the words that we use.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I can tell
you that in my experience,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
a man came through once,
and he was in hell.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.892 align:middle line:84%
And I say that he never told
his daughter he loved her.

00:26:54.892 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And all he wished was he
could tell her he loved her.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And because he
never told her he loved her,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
she never believed in herself.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.945 align:middle line:90%
She never trusted herself.

00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
She never got into
great relationships.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:90%
She never lived with people.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:90%
She lived with cats.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.555 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in
the spirit world.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was living in hell,
because the spirit world

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:90%
is really a world of the mind.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a mental world.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.272 align:middle line:90%
We live in a physical world.

00:27:14.272 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world
is a mental world.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So we live with all of the
thoughts we've ever created.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And his thought was I wish
I could have loved her more.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I have loved her more?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And that went on
for quite a while,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
because there's no time
in the spirit world.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
beating himself up.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Beating himself up.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.308 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to
beat ourselves up.

00:27:28.308 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can imagine
here on this Earth.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We do something.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We feel, well, I
shouldn't have done that.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have said that.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Imagine when you're in a world
where it's just mental thought

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:90%
over, and over, and over again.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So that can be our hell, based
on how we lived our life.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So luckily enough, a guy
came to him and said to him

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.928 align:middle line:84%
there is a medium
who can help you.

00:27:46.928 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And again to make
a long story short,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that man actually came
through me at a reading

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and was able to tell his
daughter he truly loved her,

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:90%
so that was healed.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:90%
So he was healed.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:90%
She was healed.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was healed.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
was able to move on.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she get emotional?

00:27:57.495 --> 00:27:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I bet she did.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.345 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very emotional.

00:27:58.345 --> 00:28:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, very, very-- and
her whole life changed.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Her whole life changed.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's all
she wanted to hear.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
all she needed.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And then she could
live her life fully.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So we get caught
up in those things.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to be very, very
careful and very responsible

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:84%
about what comes out of our
mouths, out of our heads,

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:90%
and our actions that we make.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And people often
said tell your people

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
when you do your lectures
that their thoughts, words,

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and deeds do count.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And they will meet them.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.902 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they pass over
here, they'll meet everything

00:28:26.902 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
they did-- good,
bad, or indifferent.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many spirits are
longing to communicate with us?

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't give you
a limited number,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:90%
because I think it's infinite.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Many, many, many,
many who realize

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:90%
that they still love you.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.325 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
know they're OK.

00:28:43.325 --> 00:28:45.033 align:middle line:84%
Most of them want you
to know they're OK.

00:28:45.033 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:90%
They're still alive.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're still part
of your everyday life.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They start to influence
your everyday life.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.578 align:middle line:84%
This is something
very interesting.

00:28:51.578 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Babies that pass over-- young
children that pass over--

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.453 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's one of
the hardest lessons

00:28:55.453 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:90%
a soul has to go through.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This
is our soul school.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.142 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the hardest lessons

00:29:00.142 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that the souls sign up for
before they come back down.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But I find that in many
cases, those souls of children

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
really pass over to
help the living person--

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:90%
their parent to follow--

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To grieve.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --through
on their destiny.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.397 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's got
to be rough for a parent

00:29:14.397 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
to lose a child.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think it's
the hardest lesson there is.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I just did a
reading in New York,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.543 align:middle line:84%
and a gentleman's
son came through.

00:29:21.543 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He did not believe
in any of this.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.068 align:middle line:84%
His wife dragged him
to one of my lecturers.

00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And the son came through
and told the daddy

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.293 align:middle line:84%
he really loved the teddy
bear that he was given

00:29:29.293 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:90%
when he was three years old.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.057 align:middle line:84%
And it still has
a hole in its arm.

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And the man was then a believer.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.783 align:middle line:90%
And he was just in awe.

00:29:35.783 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'll
use that information.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Because your son just helped
open you up spiritually

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.857 align:middle line:90%
for your whole life.

00:29:41.857 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find
that a parent who

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
has lost a young person loses
faith in believing in God?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sometimes.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes for sure.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody, but sometimes.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they feel like God
is-- what has God done to them?

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Abandoned them
or something, right?

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.288 align:middle line:90%
How could God do this?

00:29:57.288 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But, George, I think
that's changing.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I think generally speaking, the
consciousness of this planet

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:90%
is changing.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Because shows like yours, and
your radio show for years,

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and movies, and
books, and work I've

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.782 align:middle line:84%
done-- it's changing people's
outlook-- their mind.

00:30:10.782 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
death is as frightening

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:90%
as it used to be to people.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
understanding it more.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They realize it's
the transition,

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's not as scary.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
No one should be
scared to death.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no pain in death.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
There might be pain
leading up to death.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
some great drugs

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
for that, which the wonderful
spirit world has inspired

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.777 align:middle line:84%
scientists to create
these drugs and medicines,

00:30:34.777 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:90%
so there wouldn't be pain.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.510 align:middle line:90%
There should never be pain.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And no one ever dies alone.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a reunion.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
People look forward
to coming home.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:84%
That's something
people should know.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do your departed
family members really show up?

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They do show up.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
They show up months
ahead, weeks ahead.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And they look forward
to your arrival.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And usually, you will end
up at-- when you pass over,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:10%
they'll be at your
mother's house.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.135 align:middle line:90%
And they say mother's house.

00:30:56.135 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And it looks exactly like it
did on Earth, because you're

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
familiar with it.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
familiarity, and that

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:90%
helps with your transition.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a little
bit of a rest period.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:90%
But there's like a life review.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:90%
You see your whole life.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And then you begin to--

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
everybody goes back to
their memorial service as--

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I know Mary Ann has
told you that as well.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
People go back to their
memorial services and they see--

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:90%
it's so funny.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
The men always count how many
cars are in the procession.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The women are interested
in the flowers.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And my father-- this
is a funny story.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:90%
My father in his funeral--

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:90%
he was laid out.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm standing there talking.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And he came behind me.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, thanks for
putting my teeth in.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I look pretty good.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he had false teeth,

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:90%
so that was pretty good.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.482 align:middle line:90%
But they always go there.

00:31:36.482 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And there is no pain.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:90%
So people should know that.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference
between people who were

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:90%
really sensitive and empaths?

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Is there?

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The same thing.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is?

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
call them empaths.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.895 align:middle line:84%
In my school, I have a
whole class on empaths.

00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:51.943 align:middle line:84%
I have tools for the
highly sensitive.

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's really for empaths.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Those people that are
very, very open sensitive.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Their sensitivity is very open.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And the clip you saw
earlier about grounding--

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I made that specifically
for empathic people

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:90%
who are very sensitive.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And they really have to know how
to strongly be within the body

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:90%
and also deal their sensitivity.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.060 align:middle line:84%
We can't be so spiritually
evolved and so sensitive

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
that we're no earthly good.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:90%
We know we're here for a reason.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to use
that sensitivity in a way

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to expand and help ourselves
and those around us

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and teach those around us.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it's about.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We're not victims.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We are sensitive because we
might teach other people,

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and learn from
it, and teach them

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.222 align:middle line:84%
how to be sensitive
in the right way.

00:32:34.222 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
film "Sensitive"

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.055 align:middle line:84%
shows a little bit about what's
being done with research.

00:32:38.055 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Brain imaging conducted by
Jadzia Jagiellowicz during her

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:10%
doctoral studies at Stony
Brook University and published

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:10%
in social cognitive and
affective neuroscience show

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:10%
that the areas of the brain for
understanding subtle cues are

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:10%
more active in sensitive
than non-sensitive persons.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:10%
>> What this study means is that
highly sensitive people notice

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:10%
more about the
world they live in.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:10%
But the key thing is not
just that they notice more.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.850 align:middle line:10%
They take what they
notice and they combine it

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.660 align:middle line:10%
with information that they've
noticed all their life.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:10%
So because they've noticed
more all their life

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:10%
and because they're able to
combine all that information,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:10%
they often come up
with unique new ideas.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Combining ideas in novel ways
is the essence of creativity.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:10%
Even experiences while young,
such as with different animals,

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:10%
may lead later to
creative insights

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:10%
about all animals and
their temperaments.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:10%
Or combining novel
ideas might bring

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:10%
about new research
breakthroughs,

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:10%
revolutionary art, or
world-changing insights.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:10%
We are not saying that
all creative people

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.170 align:middle line:10%
are highly sensitive.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:10%
But surely the qualities we
see in them do contribute

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:10%
substantially to creativity.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Another striking
finding was that there

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:10%
was more activity for
sensitive people in the insula,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:10%
part of the brain often called
the seat of consciousness.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:10%
Because it brings together
all of our inner and outer

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Highly sensitive
individuals--

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:10%
they're engaging the
insula to a greater extent.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:10%
Because in some ways, it's
like they're more aware.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:10%
And this is in line with a
lot of the other research

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:10%
and the theory on sensory
processing sensitivity,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.609 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that highly
sensitive people are more aware

00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:10%
of others.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:10%
They're more aware
of the subtleties

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.315 align:middle line:10%
in their environment.

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with that, James?

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I do.

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
And I think the insula--
it's very interesting.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:46.781 align:middle line:90%
Because with the insula--

00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to me, it can be reached and
is reached through meditation.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And through meditation, through
quieting down, going within,

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
you become more aware and
more pure of who you are.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
are sitting in--

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I call it the stillness
of your being--

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:84%
you're getting more of that
insula, the creative self,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the sensitive self,
the soul self.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.140 align:middle line:90%
The soul is very sensitive.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a very,
very good film in that--

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
pointing out that different
experiences in our life

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
will build up to
other experiences.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And we measure things
based upon those

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.675 align:middle line:84%
and become very aware
of everything going on.

00:35:19.675 --> 00:35:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important for most people

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to be what we call mindful,
being in the moment.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And when
we live in the moment,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:84%
we're also very aware of
everything going on around us.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.765 align:middle line:84%
And I think, otherwise,
we're not being part of life.

00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
We're just living through
life, not acting in life.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You find
highly sensitive people

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.318 align:middle line:90%
are happier people?

00:35:37.318 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: To a point.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To a point?

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It depends on
what their backgrounds are.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So if they're in a
family dynamic which they don't

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
support, encourage sensitivity,
it's very, very difficult

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
than to be with a
family who does indeed

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:90%
understand sensitivity.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can
get more sensitive?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You can become
more sensitive, much more aware

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and much more sensitive
through meditation work,

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
through mindfulness work.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.853 align:middle line:84%
I find through working
with animals as well.

00:36:04.853 --> 00:36:05.653 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:05.653 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
find one exercise

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to do for sensitivities, I put
a blindfold around somebody.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.202 align:middle line:84%
And I have them walk around
the room and feel things.

00:36:12.202 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have them, what
do you feel about--

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.028 align:middle line:90%
I give them a sentence.

00:36:15.028 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel
about that sentence?

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me everything you can about
that sentence from the color

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of the sentence, the
color of the words,

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:90%
the shape of the words.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.050 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel about
it in your heart?

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing experience.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.082 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
it's pretty incredible.

00:36:29.082 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk for a
moment, James, about evil.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Evil?

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a good guy.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Evil.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can tell you've
got a heart of gold.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.655 align:middle line:90%
But there's evil out there.

00:36:37.655 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about evil.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.112 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There are evil people.

00:36:42.112 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I lived--

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I worked in Hollywood
for a long time, so yes.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
what it's like.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:90%
You've seen that.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.998 align:middle line:84%
Why is there so much
evil on this planet?

00:36:50.998 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think,
George, honestly speaking,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
believe in evil I think

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:90%
evil is a man-made concept.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It may be.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think it is.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a man-made concept.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:90%
I think there's just love.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
degrees of love or not love.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.357 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's more like that.

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Some would say evil.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
When we bring up
the word evil, it

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.830 align:middle line:84%
conjures up demons, and devils,
and these sorts of things,

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and the exorcism.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in that.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I think everything is of love.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are degrees of that.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.323 align:middle line:90%
And I think what we call evil.

00:37:23.323 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there
are bad people.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.698 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There
are bad people.

00:37:26.698 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
don't know themselves.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:84%
There are people
don't love themselves

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:90%
or no sense of themselves.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And they want to--
they want love.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And part of being-- if you
call it evil, if they're

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.172 align:middle line:84%
angry individuals,
they did bad things,

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just a
cry-out, because they

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.305 align:middle line:90%
want love for themselves.

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.613 align:middle line:84%
I think there are people
who have no conscience.

00:37:45.613 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
people that have

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.773 align:middle line:84%
maybe something going on in
their heads that isn't correct.

00:37:50.773 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they're bipolar or
whatever want to call it,

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.082 align:middle line:84%
that something is going
mentally with them as well.

00:37:55.082 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we come
back to develop our

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:84%
emotional, spiritual,
mental, and physical selves

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's some beings that
mentally they're not evolved.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
that's part of it.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in evil per se.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.135 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
man-made concepts.

00:38:09.135 --> 00:38:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But I do think there--
an absence of love.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who generally
is more sensitive?

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.675 align:middle line:90%
A male or a female?

00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Female.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is that?

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
make-up of the female

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:90%
of the right side of the brain.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.377 align:middle line:84%
And she has to be because
of having children, right?

00:38:25.377 --> 00:38:26.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:38:26.177 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The sensitivity
to be involved with the child.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a natural
make-up of the female.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
right side of the brain

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is the creative side,
is the sensitive side.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is much more
predominant the female.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
their natural state

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:90%
of being is its sensitivity.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
see this changing

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.053 align:middle line:84%
in the next few years, this
entire field that you're in?

00:38:49.053 --> 00:38:50.303 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Without a doubt.

00:38:50.303 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:90%
In the past 30 years--

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I've done this 30-plus.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I've lost count after 30.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.962 align:middle line:84%
I used to have just
women come to my events.

00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have-- I would
say half man, half women.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's huge.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And not men
that were dragged there

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:90%
by their wives either.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Men on their own.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're into this.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So they're
really into this.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's great that men
realize that they're sensitive,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
too, and that you can balance
the left and the right side

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:12.430 align:middle line:90%
of the brains.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.710 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
we realize that,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to be sensitive and
analytical at the same time.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Because my favorite
people to work

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:25.460 align:middle line:84%
with as students are those
chemists, those scientists,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.950 align:middle line:84%
medical people, who
I've worked with who

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:84%
get the grounding of
the analytical, but yet,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
they can finally use
their creativity.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And they make the best,
because the balance is there.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've
noticed on the radio show

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:84%
when we take phone
calls that it used

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to be primarily male or female,
depending on the subject

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.160 align:middle line:84%
If we were talking
about world events,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:90%
all the guys would call.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.910 align:middle line:84%
If we were talking about
the psychic readings,

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:90%
most of the women would call.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's balanced
about 50/50 as well.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
it's balanced.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly right.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On both ends.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.205 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Same with me.

00:39:58.205 --> 00:40:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's also
readership has changed.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:90%
More male than female.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It's about the same now.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's all different.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It's changing.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:90%
The consciousness has shifted.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.697 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad to see that.

00:40:07.697 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And if you have to consider it--

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.730 align:middle line:90%
35 years.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:84%
That's not a long time for
the consciousness to shift.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So do we believe
in waves of beings

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that have come through
this generation

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.603 align:middle line:84%
or the past generations
who are light workers who

00:40:20.603 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:84%
have come to change the
consciousness of the planet?

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do believe that.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we are
light workers who

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.730 align:middle line:84%
brought in this new awareness,
if you will, for people.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what you
bring up-- light workers--

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be growing, too.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
do believe in UFOs.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.595 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe in aliens.

00:40:37.595 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:90%
I do believe all of that--

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similarly.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --that we
discussed on "Coast to Coast,"

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:90%
because I've been through that.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.052 align:middle line:90%
I've been on their ships.

00:40:44.052 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:90%
I've done that.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.155 align:middle line:84%
So there's more to
life than just this.

00:40:47.155 --> 00:40:49.780 align:middle line:90%
This is a very small part of us.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier about the
soul, 20% the soul within,

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:90%
80% out.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.088 align:middle line:84%
I call this the big
toe to the soul.

00:40:57.088 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
sitting in development

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:84%
as a medium in what's called
the development circle, where

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:84%
you sit every week and you work
with the power of the energy

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to develop your sensitivity,
I would see many beings

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:90%
who are not humanoids.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We call them alienists.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're very much so.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I brought a group of
people to Sedona, Arizona,

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
and to see UFOs.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And that was years ago.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was Saturday
night in Boynton Canyon.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clear sky.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Clear sky.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stars perfect.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, let's see you.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.938 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard a voice say
to me, you need to meditate.

00:41:29.938 --> 00:41:31.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
raise your vibration.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.355 align:middle line:90%
Raise your frequency.

00:41:32.355 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe telepathy.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
bringing yourself

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:84%
higher to a higher
level, because they're

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.182 align:middle line:90%
on a higher level.

00:41:38.182 --> 00:41:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So I told everybody,
we have to meditate.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:90%
We meditated, said prayer work.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we all started
seeing these beautiful objects,

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:90%
colorful objects all over.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
TV antennas would
be the closest thing

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I could say they looked like--

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:90%
greens and yellows.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were up way
too high to be TV antennas.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.378 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But they
were all over the place.

00:41:56.378 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And a man said to
me, they're here.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I said I know.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, can you get
communication from them?

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, let me try.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:90%
So I walked out to this field.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I opened myself
up psychically.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And I opened myself
up to a point

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
where I was very, very
aware that these beings were

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:90%
on a very high level.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And they had to slow themselves
down and bring themselves down

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to such a point.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like putting a
777 ahead of a needle.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:84%
That's how much they had
to knock themselves down.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And all they said
to me was, we do not

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:90%
understand you human beings.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.580 align:middle line:84%
You have the energy of
love all around you,

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.020 align:middle line:90%
yet you don't use it.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.237 align:middle line:90%
And that's all they said.

00:42:34.237 --> 00:42:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A great question.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:36.692 align:middle line:90%
And that's all they said.

00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which I could ask you.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we use it?

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because fear.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that life
is a series of choices.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And a choice is based
upon two things--

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.995 align:middle line:90%
love or fear.

00:42:46.995 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we're
first born, we come in love.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.495 align:middle line:84%
And we're pure
because we've just

00:42:50.495 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:90%
come from the spirit realm.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And we're very, very aware.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But then we become programmed
by four or five by the adults,

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:56.988 align:middle line:90%
by teachers.

00:42:56.988 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to do this in order to
get an A. You have to do this

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
in order to receive love.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
So there's fear then introduced.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And we have to behave a certain
way to be people pleasers.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And we forget about our true
selves, our true hearts.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And we try to please
people and probably

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
tell about our mid-life time.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
We look back and say,
I'm not truly happy.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because we're living
other people's lives instead

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.910 align:middle line:84%
of our own lives, just
to receive their love.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.413 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can love us more
than we could love ourselves.

00:43:24.413 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And what other people think
of us is none of our business.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought
if I were a teacher,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
my first opening
line to the class

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:84%
would be, you are
all starting with As.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of you.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.477 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:43:36.477 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's yours
to lose, but you all

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:90%
have gotten an A in this class.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's
see what you can do.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's perfect.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
that for motivation?

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.082 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
think that's perfect.

00:43:45.082 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I think you should do that.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that you should do that.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:84%
In my classes, I
start with lectures.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say no one
can get it wrong.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.060 align:middle line:90%
There are no wrong answers.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So everything you get is right.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's your interpretation.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.430 align:middle line:90%
So there is no wrong or right.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:90%
It's your interpretation.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's right for you.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, wow, I'm
finally given the chance

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:90%
to be who I am.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
weren't a medium,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.533 align:middle line:90%
what would you be doing today?

00:44:07.533 --> 00:44:09.825 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, that's
a very interesting question.

00:44:09.825 --> 00:44:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's changed
over the years.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I'd be a landscape architect.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
because I love the garden.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I love flowers.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I love the garden.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I love nature.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A hobby?

00:44:19.703 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A hobby.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I've actually started
doing it professionally.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I actually will--
this is very interesting.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:26.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll meet with a client.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I look at their auric
feel, the different colors.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I will design the garden
according to the colors

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.975 align:middle line:90%
that they need in their aura.

00:44:32.975 --> 00:44:33.850 align:middle line:90%
So when they go out--

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --and meditate--

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.853 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --each day in
the garden, they can see it.

00:44:36.853 --> 00:44:38.080 align:middle line:90%
And I started doing that.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:90%
I had one client.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it hit
me on the way home

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that I don't need
some lady at 1 o'clock

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
in the morning calling
me up and saying,

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I want more white
instead of red.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:48.860 align:middle line:90%
So I decided, no, forget that.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So in my own house, I've
created several gardens.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I have meditation gardens,
succulent gardens,

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
vegetable gardens, rose
gardens, flower garden, just

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
for my own enhancement.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I love working
with the elements.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And one thing, George, I
do every single day, which

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:84%
everybody should do, is
I wake up with gratitude.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And every step I
take is gratitude.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I thank the universe.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just waking
up is gratitude.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
waking up is gratitude.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for another day
of experiences for my soul.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.608 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that comes in
our path every single day is--

00:45:19.608 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:84%
whether you're at
Starbucks, whether you're

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.792 align:middle line:84%
at at gas station is there a
teacher or a student of yours.

00:45:25.792 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So we always have
to remember that.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Every
single person.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.635 align:middle line:90%
A teacher or a student.

00:45:29.635 --> 00:45:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And treat them accordingly.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Treat them with respect.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:33.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about spirit guides.

00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In
my school online,

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole class
on spirit guides.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:84%
There are different
types of guides.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.300 align:middle line:90%
We all have guides.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.475 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of us.

00:45:40.475 --> 00:45:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
types of guides.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.183 align:middle line:84%
And there are some guys
called opportunity guides.

00:45:44.183 --> 00:45:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So opportunity
guides may be guides

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:84%
who come to us when we're
working on a specific project.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we're about to
begin doing some artwork--

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:90%
oil painting.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:90%
We've never done it before.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But we have that
innately within our soul.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We might draw to us an
infinity of a guide who

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:01.900 align:middle line:84%
knows is an excellent
oil painting

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and will help us and
influence us that way.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:04.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:46:04.725 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As a medium
when I was first developing,

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I had two mediums
from the spirit world

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:84%
who were opportunity
guides helping

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.353 align:middle line:90%
me to develop that sensitivity.

00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And I also had a
doctor guide that

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:18.970 align:middle line:84%
came through that helped me
that way, medically helped

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.990 align:middle line:90%
my body as I was developing.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So we all of these
opportunity guides.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.360 align:middle line:84%
There are other guides
called-- we call joy guides.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.523 align:middle line:90%
And mostly, their children.

00:46:26.523 --> 00:46:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see a lot of
children around people who are

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.390 align:middle line:90%
very depressed or very heavy.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:middle line:84%
What the child is trying
to do is influence them

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.240 align:middle line:84%
with love, and
happiness, and joy,

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have to
be heavy and depressed, so

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.933 align:middle line:90%
those type of guides.

00:46:38.933 --> 00:46:40.600 align:middle line:84%
There are all different
types of guides.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They are very much
spiritual guides.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They're philosophers who
help with philosophy.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So really it depends upon
the life that you're living.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:50.835 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:46:50.835 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Many people think
that your loved

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.850 align:middle line:84%
ones who just pass over
just going into infinity

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, their gone.

00:46:56.898 --> 00:46:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They
become your guides, too.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Many will stay with
you and be a guide.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.890 align:middle line:90%
My mother who passed over--

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.905 align:middle line:90%
she was a guide of mine.

00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And a medium said,
your mother is here.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:90%
She is a guide.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.607 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why would
my mother be a guide?

00:47:08.607 --> 00:47:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, she felt
she didn't do enough for you

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.862 align:middle line:84%
when she was living on
the Earth spiritually.

00:47:12.862 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So she wants to help you now.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that
happens quite a bit.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
agree with that?

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Totally.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, interesting.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.843 align:middle line:90%
What about angels, now?

00:47:19.843 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Where do they differ
from spirit guides?

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So angels--

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there are
many, many different realms.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.320 align:middle line:84%
There are worlds within
worlds within worlds.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.533 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that worlds
within worlds within worlds.

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
I'm going to say

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.082 align:middle line:84%
to you, which is a great one,
someone in my audience once

00:47:33.082 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:84%
asked, what is the
spirit world say

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
about the level of the Earth
compared to the cosmos?

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit
people said, well,

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:84%
think of the Earth
as a grain of sand

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:84%
on the beach that's how vast
and immense the cosmos is

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.040 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.230 align:middle line:84%
There are millions and
millions of universes.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So there are various levels
and realms of beings--

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.580 align:middle line:90%
all different types of beings.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So angels are just
another realm of beings.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.500 align:middle line:90%
That's how I'd best describe it.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
these different realms--

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:84%
if we think of it in realms
going up like a staircase,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that the higher realm has
to help the one in the lower

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.380 align:middle line:90%
realm--

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:90%
helps in the lower realm.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's really how it works.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They help those in the lower
realm to build them up,

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.483 align:middle line:90%
to bring them up.

00:48:12.483 --> 00:48:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Because we're all connected.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:14.692 align:middle line:90%
We're all in it together.

00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We sure are.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:90%
How about guardian angels?

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.665 align:middle line:90%
Who assigns them to us?

00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think that
many times before we come back

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
into the incarnation, that
you sit down with your spirit

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.810 align:middle line:90%
guides and teachers there.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are those that
are assigned to you then

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:84%
for a specific task that
have to be accomplished

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:90%
during the lifetime.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.005 align:middle line:84%
So I think at that
time in between lives,

00:48:35.005 --> 00:48:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I think, is when we are
assigned our guardian

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
angels, those ones
that work out for us

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.388 align:middle line:84%
and help us to
accomplish our task.

00:48:40.388 --> 00:48:42.888 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always think of one
of my favorite movies, James,

00:48:42.888 --> 00:48:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that my mother sat
me down to watch

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:84%
when I was about six
or seven with her

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.413 align:middle line:84%
called "It's a Wonderful
Life" with Jimmy Stewart.

00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Jimmy Stewart.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
talks about angels

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and what they do to save
you and things like that.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's very true.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's real, isn't it?

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very real.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Very, very real.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very real.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Very real.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.797 align:middle line:90%
I could see you as an actor.

00:48:59.797 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I could see you as a
theater person or an actor.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next
Omar Sharif, right?

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I could
see that with you.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ascended masters.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.170 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ascended
master-- so another type

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:90%
of guide, if you will.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But they are those beings
who are very aware who have

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of wisdom, if you will.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.668 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's so limiting
on this Earth level.

00:49:18.668 --> 00:49:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But the ascended masters--
those who have studied

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.440 align:middle line:84%
have learned many, many things
from many different realms

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.590 align:middle line:84%
who share with those
on lower realms

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:26.940 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom that they have.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.612 align:middle line:90%
So it's their ascended masters.

00:49:28.612 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
humans at some--

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Some
are and some are--

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --point?

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:31.803 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --not.

00:49:31.803 --> 00:49:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Many are not.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Many have never touched
the Earth before,

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so some are way
beyond the Earth.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're all-- again, worlds
within worlds within worlds.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.590 align:middle line:84%
All different types of
beings, if you will.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
that do not look human.

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So you have to understand that.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.212 align:middle line:84%
Many do not look
human whatsoever.

00:49:48.212 --> 00:49:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing-- this
is really interesting.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
In my school online, I
have people get in touch

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.440 align:middle line:90%
with their guides.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.783 align:middle line:84%
And an easy exercise that I
have them do is I have them--

00:49:56.783 --> 00:49:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I walk them through
a process of closing

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:90%
their eyes and the breath.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The breath brings
us back to center.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them, ask
out, send out a thought.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit guide, please come
behind me and put your hands

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.820 align:middle line:84%
upon my shoulders, that
I might feel your energy

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and know what your
energy feels like

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and who you are
as far as a guide.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.460 align:middle line:90%
What kind of guide are you?

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Are you a philosopher?

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Are you a teacher?

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you an opportunity guide?

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you ascended master?

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And it works very,
very well when

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.730 align:middle line:84%
we open ourselves up and
surrender to the energy

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:28.937 align:middle line:90%
that we're feeling.

00:50:28.937 --> 00:50:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that with
a whole series of guides.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I call them your team.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.897 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your spiritual--
it works really well.

00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:36.765 align:middle line:84%
It's on my school
and my website.

00:50:36.765 --> 00:50:39.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has technology
done for you, for what you do?

00:50:39.555 --> 00:50:41.305 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
I'm not a tech person.

00:50:41.305 --> 00:50:42.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't like tech.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm an old generation.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Old school.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Old school.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot has changed
in our lifetime.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you send
text messages to people?

00:50:49.315 --> 00:50:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I do send text
messages, but not all the time.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the devices.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.948 align:middle line:84%
What happens for me, I feel
it reaches more people.

00:50:57.948 --> 00:50:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's true with my school.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.130 align:middle line:90%
My school online right now--

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.908 align:middle line:84%
I reach over at
least 20 countries.

00:51:03.908 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see, you couldn't
do that in the old days.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Couldn't
do that in the old days.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.830 align:middle line:84%
You had to go travel on a plane
and get to a place and lecture.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But I have people in
Africa, and Brazil,

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and throughout Europe, through
the Middle East, by the way.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Middle East is very
big into spirituality.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.320 align:middle line:90%
China, Japan, all over.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And they love this topic that
I work with-- life after death.

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And that in itself--

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:90%
technology is great.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Marshall McLuhan said when the
world becomes technologically

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.870 align:middle line:84%
advanced, it'll be
a global community.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And that is what's

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --happening.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he also said
the media is the message.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
media is a message.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's used in the
correct, right way.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It can benefit humankind.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But it also can
destroy humankind.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But we have to have that
awareness that we bring it up

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.190 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level of respect
and love for each other.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.997 align:middle line:84%
How can we enhance
another person's life?

00:51:53.997 --> 00:51:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How
can we enhance?

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.035 align:middle line:90%
Let's think of it that way.

00:51:57.035 --> 00:52:00.540 align:middle line:84%
How can I use this technology
to enhance someone else's life?

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.840 align:middle line:84%
How can I make some
else's life better?

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People ask me all
the time, how do you meditate?

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.850 align:middle line:90%
You teach people that.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And just become aware of this
beautiful, spiritual garden

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.330 align:middle line:10%
that you create with your mind.

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:23.590 align:middle line:10%
We'll take a deep
breath and exhale.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.970 align:middle line:10%
And as you see this
beautiful garden,

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:10%
there is a bench sitting right
in the middle of that garden,

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.500 align:middle line:10%
a nice marble bench.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Let's go now and sit
on that marble bench

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:40.060 align:middle line:10%
and just feel all the
energy of this garden,

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:10%
the colors of the flowers,
the life source flowing

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:10%
through all.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.030 align:middle line:10%
You are connected to
every blade of grass,

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:10%
every leaf on every tree.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.620 align:middle line:10%
Just feel the oneness
that you are a part of.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:10%
And as you feel
this completeness,

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.055 align:middle line:10%
this oneness with
this world around you,

00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:08.310 align:middle line:10%
standing behind
you at this bench--

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:10%
a being of light, one of
your guides comes close.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:16.140 align:middle line:10%
Invite them into your space.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.720 align:middle line:10%
Invite your guide to
come close behind you

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.330 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps touch
your shoulders.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Become aware of
what they feel like.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Become aware of their
love, their energy,

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.510 align:middle line:10%
that you are able
to identify them.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:10%


00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:37.110 align:middle line:10%
Invite them to be closer
to you enfolding themselves

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.060 align:middle line:10%
around you, so you
truly feel this guide.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.230 align:middle line:10%
And as you let them come in,
talk to them with your mind,

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.520 align:middle line:10%
with your thoughts.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.720 align:middle line:10%
Send out a thought saying,
give me a message, dear guide.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.342 align:middle line:10%
Let me hear what you
have to say to me.

00:53:57.342 --> 00:53:59.697 align:middle line:10%
Listen with your mind.

00:53:59.697 --> 00:54:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.060 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
we give gratitude

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.240 align:middle line:10%
to this lovely guide,
one of many guides.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.990 align:middle line:10%
But this one steps forward
to be with you today.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.740 align:middle line:10%
And thank them.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.470 align:middle line:10%
Gratitude is the right attitude.

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:10%
So feel their energy.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Thank them for being
with you and just

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.013 align:middle line:10%
acknowledge with your guide
a sign that they give you.

00:54:25.013 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:10%
How will you know
when they're with you?

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:10%
Let them give you a sign.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.920 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps you'll feel a touch on
your shoulder, wind upon you,

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:10%
whatever sign they want
to give you personally,

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:10%
that this guide is with you.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:39.523 align:middle line:10%
Let them do that now.

00:54:39.523 --> 00:54:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're almost
like a hypnotist.

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, yeah.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were mesmerized.

00:54:45.368 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That was a very
good example of the guide

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:90%
exercise I was talking about.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But are very easy
ways to meditate, too.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.283 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do that.

00:54:52.283 --> 00:54:54.075 align:middle line:84%
But it really works
with the breath, right?

00:54:54.075 --> 00:54:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we could just use our
thoughts, because thoughts

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:57.230 align:middle line:90%
are things.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And imagine, let's say,
a beautiful light coming

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.400 align:middle line:84%
through the breath
with the nostrils going

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:84%
into the nostrils
or count to three.

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.630 align:middle line:90%
We can do it right now, OK?

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's give it a try.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Teach me.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So into nostrils.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Count to three.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Out of the mouth--

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.710 align:middle line:90%
count to three.

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.627 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to breathe
in beautiful lights.

00:55:11.627 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So breathe in, all the way down
to the bottom of your toes.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.942 align:middle line:90%
This beautiful light.

00:55:15.942 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And imagine these lights
surround every muscle,

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.420 align:middle line:90%
cell of your being.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, you exhale
out of your mouth.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Any old, stagnant
energy-- let it go.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Blow it out.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Blow it out.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Blow it out.

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:31.475 align:middle line:84%
And again, now inhale
this beautiful light.

00:55:31.475 --> 00:55:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You are part of that light.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.250 align:middle line:90%
That light is part of you.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And now exhale all the old
ways of thinking, limitations,

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:40.040 align:middle line:90%
let them go.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Let them go.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Let them go.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.280 align:middle line:90%
And one more time.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And inhale all the way down.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And now exhale.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.388 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:55:56.388 --> 00:55:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm keeping you.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.663 align:middle line:90%
You make-- you feel good.

00:55:58.663 --> 00:56:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that centers
you right away, right?

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It centers you right away.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does that work?

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work?

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because you
breathe in that freshness.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.730 align:middle line:90%
The breath is a gift from God.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a renewal.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a freshness of energy.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:90%
It's life force.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.785 align:middle line:90%
So you bring in life force.

00:56:12.785 --> 00:56:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're letting
go of that old stuff

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.803 align:middle line:84%
that you're holding onto
that you no longer need,

00:56:16.803 --> 00:56:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that we think we need.

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you let it go.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.547 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you just
let it go and be replaced

00:56:20.547 --> 00:56:21.800 align:middle line:90%
with that new life force.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So you feel refreshed,
revitalized,

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.015 align:middle line:90%
centered in your being.

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine if
you do that every day--

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:28.690 align:middle line:90%
how you'd feel.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's definitely
a tie-in between mind and body.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Without a doubt.

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:34.550 align:middle line:90%
What you think, you become.

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So everything you are
right now in your body,

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a disease, whether
it's an ailment, whatever

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.360 align:middle line:84%
it might be in your
body is because you

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.090 align:middle line:90%
thought about it in your mind.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would James
Van like to be remembered?

00:56:46.948 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I would
like to be remembered

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.700 align:middle line:84%
by helping to change people's
hearts, open people's hearts

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.528 align:middle line:90%
and minds.

00:56:54.528 --> 00:56:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do that.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I do that.

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I try to do that.

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.060 align:middle line:90%
I attempt to do that.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Everybody I meet, whether
it's at Starbucks or a waiter,

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I will say something
kind to them.

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And I will bring love to them.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody needs to
be acknowledged with love.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to do
that the best I can.

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And I have fun with that.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you're a human being.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.390 align:middle line:90%
So do you ever lose your temper?

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever get mad?

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, sure.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I get mad.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I get upset.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I get frustrated,
I guess you'd say.

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But I get really
frustrated myself.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.400 align:middle line:90%
I get impatient.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get impatient--
that ignorance.

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I get impatient.

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I get really angry people
doing bad things to each other.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:29.650 align:middle line:90%
That-- I get really angry at.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a tense
time right now, James.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.103 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That they
shouldn't do these things.

00:57:33.103 --> 00:57:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But I also-- then I
look at what we're

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:84%
going to learn from-- like
let's say politically right now,

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.780 align:middle line:90%
we're in a tough time.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.238 align:middle line:84%
But what are we
learning from that?

00:57:39.238 --> 00:57:40.420 align:middle line:90%
What's the bigger picture?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.962 align:middle line:84%
We always have to look at the
bigger picture, not the minute.

00:57:42.962 --> 00:57:44.045 align:middle line:90%
What's the bigger picture?

00:57:44.045 --> 00:57:46.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if we don't learn,
we're wasting the opportunity,

00:57:46.705 --> 00:57:47.260 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.927 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We're
wasting the moments.

00:57:48.927 --> 00:57:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Life is made up of moments.

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.610 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
with that moment?

00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could talk
to the world tonight--

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.450 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to
half of them now--

00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.520 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I would tell them
to bring that energy of love

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and find God in
every single person.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Every single person is God.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They may look different.

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They may speak a
different language,

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:09.910 align:middle line:90%
but there's a commonality.

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.932 align:middle line:84%
There's a creativity
in each person.

00:58:11.932 --> 00:58:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about religion.

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
God and energy.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.440 align:middle line:10%
Try to find that
God in each person

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:10%
and treat them accordingly.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.050 align:middle line:10%
Treat them as sacredness.

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And treat them with love.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would say.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the way to do it.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
love is the answer.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, James?

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.460 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They
find me two ways.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.280 align:middle line:10%
My website is www.vanpraagh.com.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.720 align:middle line:10%
And my school is the JVP
School of Mystical Arts.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And spell your
last name for people.

00:58:34.595 --> 00:58:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's V-A-N,
capital P-R-A-A-G-H.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:39.025 align:middle line:90%
You're one of the good guys.

00:58:39.025 --> 00:58:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thanks, George.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:40.570 align:middle line:90%
You, too.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: James Van Praagh
on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.870 align:middle line:10%
Look, one day when
I meet my maker,

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.727 align:middle line:10%
I'm coming back through him
to keep this show going.

00:58:49.727 --> 00:58:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sounds good.

00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a deal.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."
