00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:24.252 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:10%
Freddy Silva with us,
best-selling author

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:10%
and leading researcher
of ancient civilizations,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:10%
restricted history, sacred
sites, and their interaction

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:10%
with massive consciousness.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Freddy, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Thanks
for having me on again.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.508 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, yes, sir.

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, what exactly
is restricted sites?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Oh, the
things that people

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:10%
don't want to talk
about that make

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.087 align:middle line:10%
academics very uncomfortable.

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.235 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Such as?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: So we
have a story, which

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:10%
is what all the boys and
the girls get together

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:10%
and the table and say, this
is how history really is.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you forget about
all the other evidence that

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:90%
doesn't quite fit the paradigm.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you make everybody
else into pseudo-scientists.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't they
go public with this?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.027 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a good
question, isn't it?

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.493 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lack of funding
that goes around colleges.

00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
There's only so
many colleges that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.178 align:middle line:84%
are available for
hiring these people.

00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So many places you
can get published.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.812 align:middle line:84%
So if you rock the
boat, you're out.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't get published,
you don't get funding,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's the end
of your career.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of feel
for them in that way.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the whole
point of being a scientist

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.208 align:middle line:84%
is to discover the unknown and
keep discovering the unknown

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and keep going where
the evidence takes you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.872 align:middle line:84%
and not restrict the evidence
to follow a certain theory.

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, we'll get nowhere.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
some ancient history

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:90%
first for a moment.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.917 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, twist my arm.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly were
the gods of the ancient times?

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.587 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Not a guy with a white
beard sitting on a throne.

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:90%
We, in the Western--

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With clouds
all around it, right?

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They were basically an
understanding of nature.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And the gods were
nature spirits.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So grass is a god, a chair
is a god, a stone is a god.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
lives, breathes, moves,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
was created in the universe has
its own god or its own essence,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that basically
was able to understand

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
this essence, look
at the glue that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
holds these objects together,
was deemed to be as a god.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So you became, for
example, a person

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.833 align:middle line:84%
who understands how water
works, you became the water god.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not because you're
better than anybody else,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
it's just that you
able to perceive nature

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:90%
on a very subtle level.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of elevates you
as a person within yourself

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:90%
but not within the tribe.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, we
elevated these people

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.098 align:middle line:84%
to become like some social
status, if you like.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
what the Greeks did?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
gods for everything.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Pretty much.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, they kind of
mythologized everything

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because by that time,
they've lost a plot.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.825 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea what
they really were doing.

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
For them, the gods
were mysterious forces

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that were mythological.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But the Egyptians before them
were actually admonishing them.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
They were saying, well, you
know, you Greeks are too young.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Wait till you're in our shoes.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
We've been around for
over 36,000 years,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and this is how things are.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You're beginning to lack
the understanding of what

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:90%
things really are.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
These are not just
myths, they're

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:90%
actually eyewitness accounts.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So there was a gap between
reality and fiction.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:84%
By the time the Greeks
get hold of the story,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
by the time the Romans
get hold the story,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
they haven't no idea
where anything is.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It all supposed to be
just make-believe spirits.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But to the Egyptians
and any ancient culture,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
they are real
people and they had

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:90%
possessed extraordinary gifts.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was going
on all around the planet

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%
in different regions.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island, they
had their gods.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
They had their gods
everywhere, ain't they?

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back
12,000 years, the picture

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is dramatically different.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we have
a different planet,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
we have a different
sea level which

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
is exposing much
more landmass, and we

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
have all of these
different cultures which

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
talk about these gods
suddenly arriving

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
on massive boats,
double-hulled canoes,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
for example, out of nowhere.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.768 align:middle line:90%
And they would stay behind.

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
They would replenish
their resources.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.558 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
tell the local shaman

00:03:56.558 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and local wisdom-keepers
a bit more of the wisdom

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:90%
that they knew.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It's as though there was two
civilizations working parallel

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You had hunter-gatherers
like us,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you had
the gods, the people

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
who understood
the laws of nature

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and could manipulate
nature in incredible ways.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
They are astronomers,
seafarers, they

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
knew about the
mysteries of life,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
and they would teach
the hunter-gatherers

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
a bit of understanding
to help them elevate

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.007 align:middle line:84%
themselves so that one day they
could be like the gods as well.

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the
gods humans, Freddy,

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.307 align:middle line:90%
or were they supernatural?

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, the thing that
I've found over the years,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
looking at all the
indigenous cultures,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that they decreed that these
people were very much like us,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
but not quite like us.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word they were
human like, but not quite human

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:90%
is the phrase I always find.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
So they were very tall.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians gives us an
actual dimension in one

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
of the temples.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:10%
There were five cubits tall.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of which
cubit you're using--

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
because there were several--

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that would be between eight
to about 10 feet tall.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And that goes with
the skeletons that we

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
find in many of the giants'
graves around the world.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giants.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Giant people.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But there were other
giants as well.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll go there some other time.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So they were very,
very, very tall people.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were often
elongated skull.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were
redheaded and green eyed

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.485 align:middle line:84%
and blond and blue eyed
and always light skinned.

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:15.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they ETs?

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They
didn't mention this.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying they were
always associated with Orion.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:10%
That always comes up
all around the world,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:10%
whether you're in Easter
Island, New Zealand--

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The star system.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.297 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: --the Sahara.

00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the Orion system, and
specifically the belt stars.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said that at one time,
these people had the ability

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to go from our level of reality
to the belt stars of Orion.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it would be
like Grand Central Station,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:90%
you go anywhere you want.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.325 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was done
physically or out of body

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
as an experience
where you can actually

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
project yourself to
be somewhere else,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that now is a
matter of conjecture

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
because these stories
are no longer there.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I
found in my research

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is that they were very
much like us, just

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
manipulate the laws of nature

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
as we know them to
get from A to B.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
They had a foot in both
worlds, if you like.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But they certainly
weren't afraid of them.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.063 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
comfortable with who

00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
they were, which
makes me believe

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.647 align:middle line:84%
they were very much like us,
just a little bit different.

00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
gods of New Zealand?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.678 align:middle line:90%
What's unusual about them?

00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's unusual
because no one actually

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:90%
knows about them.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Go back about 12,000 years.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we have not just
Easter Island and New Zealand,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
but you also have many other
islands which are now gone.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.128 align:middle line:90%
They have disappeared.

00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:28.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ah, this
is the big story.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
Easter Island every year.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They were meeting a
tribe called the Waitaha.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.937 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Waitaha.

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Hardly anyone's
known about these people.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And the oral tradition just
got published recently.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was very privileged to
hear about this, published it

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
in my new book.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And they were saying that
every year, these gods called

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:10%
the Urukehu would
show up on Easter

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:10%
Island from the great
lands in the East

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:10%
called Kainga
Nuinui, which I would

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:10%
take to be either missing
land or South America, one

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:10%
or the other.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And these gods would
go to Easter Island.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
appear in the place called

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
the birthplace of the gods.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, now
we're getting somewhere.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that the
birthplace of the gods

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
is this location on the
South Island of New Zealand.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural landscape temple
full of very unusual features,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
all of which have been
shaped by human hands.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And this has been in the
oral tradition of the Waitaha

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:90%
for over 12,000 years.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
They just published
this information.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
do these gods go?

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well,
apparently, when they

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
were done with New
Zealand, they will go back

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
to this lands somewhere
in South America.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But in between the peregrine
nations around the Pacific,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
they got caught
in the big flood.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Not many of them survived.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The ones that did were
able to survive and go back

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:90%
to New Zealand.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then two
generations later, they

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
show up in Easter Island,
which back then were

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
described as an archipelago,
not one island, several of them.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was still a
lot of landmass around.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And there, they were
in charge of remapping

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific because the
whole landmass had completely

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And there a title that was
given from one of their leaders.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
She was called the "Net
of the World," which

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is kind of interesting because
the same description is

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
given of the surviving gods who
were in Egypt at the same time.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big overlap
here between people

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
who are navigating the
Pacific and they were also

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.882 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt and South
America at the same time.

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And the big connection
with South America

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever
the gods used to go

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
from the birthplace of
the gods in New Zealand

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
back to South America, they
were set to take two totem

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:90%
birds with them.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And one was called Titi,
one was called Caca.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And together, you get Titicaca.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha ha.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that
somewhere before the flood

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
of 12,000 years ago, there was
a civilization on Lake Titicaca.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know
that as a city of Tiwanaku

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:90%
and all the area around it.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does Atlantis
come up at all

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:90%
in these ancient discussions?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It does.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's more linked
to the Mayan culture,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
or should I say the
pre-Mayan culture.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back, again
to the same time period,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
everything has been destroyed.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Not many people survived.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And in 9600 BC-- and this is
actually written down in one

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.715 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred
books of the Maya--

00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
a group of gods suddenly arrives
in what is called the Yucatan,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:90%
and they were called the Itz.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And they navigated from
stepping stone to stepping stone

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
the remains of what used to be
a big landmass in the Atlantic

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:90%
from a place called Atl.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
They were really into
big names back then.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, they are.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Aztec
eventually called it

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Aztlan, or as we know
it today, Atlantis.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atlantis.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
said that, basically,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were called the
people of the serpent.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with being reptilian.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's to the fact that anyone
who harnessed the laws of nature

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
was deemed to be in control
of the serpent energy,

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
because the serpents move
like this, as does energy.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got to
be some truth to this.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Because at the same moment on
the other side of the Atlantic,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
there's a group of people
called the Ophiussa, who

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:90%
land in Portugal--

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in fact, in the location
where I was born,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.653 align:middle line:90%
which is really weird--

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were called the
people of the serpent

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:90%
as well at the same time.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And they escaped the sinking
landmass in the Atlantic.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time in Egypt, they

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
show up as the
followers of Horus.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.022 align:middle line:84%
There are also a
people of the serpent.

00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
the same group of people

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
going out and repopulating
the world after everything

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
been completely changed.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they the Viracocha?

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.495 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They are also
related to Viracocha.

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
connects all of these people

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
together is that the
nickname that they had

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:90%
were Shining Ones.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.747 align:middle line:90%
So in South America--

00:10:32.747 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Shining Ones.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the
Viracocha shows up,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and he has a group of
seven architects with him.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a woman who
happens to be his wife as well,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
which is very convenient.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.943 align:middle line:84%
And they were called
the Hayhuaypanti.

00:10:44.943 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You got to learn
all these things.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know these names?

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I asked the
local people what they

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.448 align:middle line:90%
mean in their local language.

00:10:51.448 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, does
that mean something?

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, it means
"the shining people."

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.397 align:middle line:84%
I went, my god,
are you telling me

00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that Viracocha landed
here in South America

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:90%
with a group of shining people?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They said, yes, which is where
we get the name Tiwanaku from,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:90%
that city that they built.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
in Egypt, the gods,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
they were called the Shining
Ones the followers of Horus.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have two different
parts of the world,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
two different groups of gods,
one charismatic leader who

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
leads a group of
seven people, also

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:90%
called by the same nickname.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So we see that all
of these people

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
belong to the same
group of gods.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just that
they were gods here,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
gods there, and everywhere.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the fact that all
belong to the same family.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:90%
But they were worldwide.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's the piece
that's been missing all along.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia program
"Ancient Advanced Technology,"

And there's one on the
corresponding side.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:90%
You see more here.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:84%
You always have two
corresponding keystone cuts

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:90%
on each side.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this is exactly
what we see at Ollantaytambo.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:10%
This is also a pre-Inca
kind of construction.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:10%
We know the Tiwanaku was built
at least 1,000 years, if not

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:10%
more, before the Incas existed.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
In many ways,
these keystone cuts

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
are proof that
the Incas were not

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.512 align:middle line:84%
building Ollantaytambo
or the other buildings

00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:90%
that we've seen around Cuzco.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:10%
This is the famous Gate of
the Sun here at Tiwanaku.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:10%
You can see how this
megalithic piece of andesite

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:10%
has been split by an earthquake.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this gate isn't really
from this part of Tiwanaku.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:10%
This gate is from the
Pumapunku section of Tiwanaku

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:10%
which is several
kilometers over that way.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:10%
If you look up here, you can
see the sun god Viracocha.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
He's holding two
staff on either side.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:10%
These may have been jade
scepters of authority.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:10%
Notice, too, that he has
tears coming down his cheeks.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:10%
He seems to be crying.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:10%
These are sometimes called
the "tears of the sun."

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Gold is often called
the "tears of the sun"

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:10%
here in South America.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:10%
This is something of an
indication that Tiwanaku also

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:10%
as a massive metallurgical
plant processing ores

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:10%
and creating gold,
silver, and copper.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Some people say,
too, that Viracocha's

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:10%
crying for the red
land, for Atlantis,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.815 align:middle line:10%
the land that's been destroyed
and no longer exists.

the same color as his jeans

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:90%
You notice these things.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Look, David did a great job
explaining what that was,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but my question to
you, Freddy, is why?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Why all those inscriptions?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And what's it all mean?

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.712 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, that's a
masterpiece, that doorway.

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it classic?

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's an
incredible calendar.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, the head dress,
it's actually Pachacamac.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not Viracocha,
it's Pachacamac.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
He's the creator
of the universe.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:90%
He's holding two serpents--

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
the electricity and
magnetism, the forces

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that create the universe.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you just look
at the numerical values

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of the headdress, that
gives you the Metonic cycle

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
which are the cycle of the
moon relative to the calendar

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
of the sun?

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they know this?

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's a couple
of mathematicians that

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.857 align:middle line:90%
have done some work on this.

00:14:43.857 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember their
names off the top of my head.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But they looked at all
the little vultures

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and the little symbols
on that portal,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and they found that the angles
at which their beaks are

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
actually put together, which
are very unusual angles,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
they are the degree of latitude
at which that portal stands.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.773 align:middle line:90%
And also they match the--

00:15:01.773 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:90%
[COUGH] excuse me--

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:90%
the eclipse cycles.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They match the paths of
Venus and other planets.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is a big
cylindrical masterpiece.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It even gives you
the sunspot cycles.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So someone who was a master
astronomer, a real lover

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.752 align:middle line:84%
of the sky, completely carved
this on a piece of andesite.

00:15:21.752 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was already
there before the flood

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
because the local story is--

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without computers
for crying out loud.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's massive computer.

00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
language itself.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Aymara, which is also the
name of the local language,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
it was based on the
same algebraic format

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that a computer can understand.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.525 align:middle line:90%
It's a design language.

00:15:40.525 --> 00:15:42.067 align:middle line:84%
It's not an organic
language like you

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and I understand English.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And English is grown out
of Roman, and Celtic,

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and the Germanic
languages and Indo-Ayran.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:90%
That takes thousands of years.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Aymara just shows up
completely developed.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And the syntax can be
understood by a computer which

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:84%
can then translate Aymara
into any other root language.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the result of a
mathematician and a computer

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:90%
designer to work this out.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's an invented language.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It shows up out of nowhere.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Aymara always said,
and still do to this very day,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, we came from a sunken
continent called Lupakije.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know it by
another name, Mu,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:90%
which, of course, is Lemuria.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And they still teach
this in the schools

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to children around
Lake Titicaca today.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.127 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yeah, we came here.

00:16:25.127 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
We were the helpers of the gods.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:90%
We're not the gods.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
We're the helpers that
came from that land.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They helped us survive the
catastrophe of the flood

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up
in South America.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And they still talk
about it today.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.407 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were these ETs?

00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they still
say the same thing--

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
they were very
human-like but not human.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:90%
They were much taller than us.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They were different, but
they were kind of like us.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't afraid of them.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
They were very comfortable
with who they were.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they talk
about them coming down

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:84%

as you and I go shopping

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:90%
The ships-- and in fact--

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the designs are still
in the Samoa and Tonga today.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:90%
They have massive catamarans.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.196 align:middle line:84%
And they can hold 200 people
in one go, and they do go.

>>NOORY: Where are
these ships now?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.248 align:middle line:84%

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Gone.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
Completely disappeared.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sunk?

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.629 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Sunk.

00:17:17.629 --> 00:17:21.145 align:middle line:84%
And also because they're made
of balsa and different reeds,

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
they just fall apart.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.381 align:middle line:90%
They go back into the soil.

00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's hardly
any archaeological evidence

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
to back it up.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it's
under the ocean now.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
There's whole islands that
even only 200 years ago

were in the Pacific
that disappeared.

does this tell you

00:17:35.257 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
civilizations of the past?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%

any ancient culture, unlike
the Western culture today,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
thinks in the round, that
things always come and go.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to learn
from our predecessors

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
so we don't make the same
mistakes of the past.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.907 align:middle line:84%
That's where they keep
giving us the knowledge

of their experience so that
when we approach cataclysms--

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean right now, we're
in the middle of one,

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:90%
if you can call it that.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But even NASA now admits that
we're, in the next 10 years,

we're facing a lot of stuff
coming out of the sky.

close in the next 10 years.

It is the same place

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The gods also had the
same thing about the sky.

They're obsessed with the sky.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Now why would you
be that obsessed

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
unless you wanted to keep
track of deep space objects?

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
You built a civilization.

You don't want it to go away.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
they were very fatalistic.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
They recognize the fact
that things come and go.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:90%
The idea is that people survive.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And the survivors must have the
information and the knowledge

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild, not from scratch,
but where they left off.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.048 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they kept putting
the information on big stones

00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
because the big stones survive
no matter what happened.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were
there certain areas

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
around this planet that were
more advanced than others

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:90%
at those times, like Egypt?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
How far advanced was
Egypt from other areas?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There were
pockets of civilization.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was one book, which
is called The Building Text.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.785 align:middle line:84%
It's written all across
the Temple of Edfu.

00:19:00.785 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:84%
At least the Greeks found
at least half of it.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
incredible story there.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty concurrent with
the beginning of the Younger

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Dryas, the Ice Age.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:90%
So that was about 12,800 BC.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It tells about how the
gods, these Shining

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Ones, the followers of
Horus, show up in Egypt

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to build the primordial mounds
and, I quote, "upon which

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:90%
we build the historic temples."

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm aware,
there were nine mounds.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying that our
land had been partially sunk

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
by a catastrophe, which is
exactly what was happening

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
with the first Ice Age.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Sea levels rose.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Comets came down.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:10%
They were looking for
a new homeland in which

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:10%
to rebuild their former world.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And there at a time
about 10,600 BC.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of interesting
because archaeology has just

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
found evidence that,
along the Nile--

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the exact area we're
talking about--

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a sudden
dramatic civilization.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.745 align:middle line:84%
We suddenly discover animal
husbandry and agriculture.

00:19:58.745 --> 00:19:59.545 align:middle line:90%
It's an anomaly.

00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:01.462 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't have been
discovering agriculture

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And it ties in exactly
with the arrival

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
of these half-human, half-divine
gods, as they call themselves.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So these are places like Karnak
and also the Giza Pyramids.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you follow
the trajectory of that story

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and follow the information
that Robert Bauval and Adrian

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Gilbert did with the pyramids
and the dating to 10,400 BC,

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
you can also see how
some of the architecture

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
follows that megalithic
style up and down the Nile.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look 13 layers
below the Temple of Edfu,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.985 align:middle line:90%
there's your original temple.

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to go down
on the side of the temple

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to find that.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So these things have been
built and rebuilt, and rebuilt,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and rebuilt.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So they were already
losing their homeland.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
They knew that stuff was
coming out of the sky.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And they had barely 1,000
years to get their act together

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
before the next
catastrophe struck.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end of
the Ice Age, the big flood.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
Central America

00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.787 align:middle line:84%
fit into this scheme
of development?

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Same people
as there were in Egypt.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Same people that were also in
New Zealand and the Far East.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same people?

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:84%

We have Kukulkan.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.408 align:middle line:10%

talked about, which is Itzamna.

believes Quetzalcoatl

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:10%
could have an ancient link
to the Sumerian god, Enki?

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Based on his research,
he discovered

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that Enki left Sumer
and resided in Egypt.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
When he came to Egypt,
he became Osiris.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:10%
According to the Egyptian
Book of the Dead,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:10%
Osiris was then killed by Set
and resurrected by his wife

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:10%
Isis as the son, Horus.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:10%
- In some Sumerian texts,
but also in Egyptian ones,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:10%
Horus takes
advantage of the fact

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:10%
that Venus appears in the
sky to start the fight.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
That is interesting because the
link between Horus and Venus

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
is quite clear.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%

defeats Set, he completely

disappears from Egyptian texts.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:10%
I think that I found his
trace in America near Mexico

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.432 align:middle line:10%
under the name Quetzalcoatl.

00:22:40.432 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:10%
I think that he wanted to leave
the Sumerian and Egyptian gods'

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:10%
heavy atmosphere to create
his own community where

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:10%
he will be called Quetzalcoatl.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:10%
We also find traces of
him a little further down,

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:10%
such as in Peru, under
the name Viracocha.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:10%
I believe when he
flees to America

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:10%
he isolates himself,
he transforms

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:10%
into this wise character, has
a whole community around him,

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:10%
and he calls himself
Quetzalcoatl.

- Among the Aztecs,
whose beliefs

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:10%
are the best documented in

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:10%

He's on the right track.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was also following
the same trajectory.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.598 align:middle line:84%
But there are two
things you need to know

00:23:37.598 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:90%
about the ancient wisdom.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.780 align:middle line:84%
One is an eyewitness
story, and the other one

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphoric
spiritual understanding.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes the two overlap.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They blend.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've also thinking about
the same trajectory where

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the same person might have been
going all around the world.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.278 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
that would be very

00:23:53.278 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
hard to do because
you really have

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to move from across
continents, literally,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
in the blink of an eye to
be in different locations

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
doing exactly the same
thing at the same time.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So where my story
differs slightly

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
is that these people were all
part of the same group of gods,

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.117 align:middle line:90%
but they were all related.

00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the overlap is.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.102 align:middle line:84%
So Osiris is its own
individual person.

00:24:14.102 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:10%
Enki is an individual person.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:10%
But they belong to the
same group of people.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they seem
to travel around a lot?

>>SILVA: I don't know.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they seem to
have a sort of a concern

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
keep their memory

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.175 align:middle line:84%

of these catastrophes.

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They did a
good job with that.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They certainly did,

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
by a guy called Enmed-Ur-Annu
who becomes known as Enoch,

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
so the Hebrews changed the name.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was one of their kind.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the story
just before the flood

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and you see the
heartache that they had.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They said we've lost contact
and control of these small group

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of Watchers who were
the craftspeople

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
of the lords of Anu.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They went down and
mated with human women.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
They taught them things
that hunter-gatherers really

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.813 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't know at
this stage in life,

00:25:32.813 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because you have had a certain
amount development in order

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to take up arms and do this,
and that, and the other.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And they said, rein them in.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We went after the Watchers us to
bring in the renegade Watchers.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.292 align:middle line:84%
So there was a small group
of them that defied orders.

00:25:46.292 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They began to teach humans
things that they shouldn't

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:90%
know at that stage of life.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And they came back to them
and said we've lost control.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough manpower to
bring in the renegade Watchers.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And worse, their offspring,
the Nephila, which

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:90%
mean the children of Orion.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nephilim?

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're the really tall
people, the real giants that

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
go around eating
people and doing

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:90%
some really horrible things.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bible
makes reference to.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's
nothing we can do.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Humans will not survive.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
The whole planet will be a
planet of red-head covered,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
giant people in no time.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we're going
to manufacture the flood.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:90%
And there would be survivors.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Gods will stay behind to
teach the surviving humans

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
how to restart civilization.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We will teach them how to
take care of themselves.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.752 align:middle line:90%
So we owe them a big favor.

00:26:29.752 --> 00:26:31.877 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we wouldn't be
doing this show, would we?

00:26:31.877 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far
back did this happen?

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This would
have been 9700 BC.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's geological evidence
that now shows in the Greenland

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:84%
ice cores that there was
a massive polarization

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
of the earth.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Something horrible happened.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Things struck the earth.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.543 align:middle line:84%
And every culture
around the world--

00:26:47.543 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was effected.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: 180 flood myths
around the world talk

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
about burning mountains
coming out of the sky,

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
hitting the earth in all the
exact places in the ocean.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A meteoroid,
an asteroid?

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.167 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly, or meteorites.

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
case in Nepal, where

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:84%
they said that the water
reached the Himalaya.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.875 align:middle line:84%
Now you think,
that's three miles--

00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Up.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --three miles high.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Well I found a ballistics
report in Los Alamos

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
where they were looking
at exactly the same story.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, would it be
possible for an object--

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
let's say half a mile wide--
coming in at the right angle,

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
with the right kinetic energy,
in the right deep pockets

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
of a trench off
Peru, for example,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
what would happen
if we reproduced

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:26.760 align:middle line:90%
that in the laboratory?

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.677 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tsunami time.

00:27:27.677 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And they did.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:90%
The object hits the water.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And the plume that goes
up is three miles high,

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:84%
which means that when
it comes back down

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it's going to recreate the same
height when it hits a landmass.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is, now, actually
put down in scientific terms

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually produce
a three-mile-high tsunami

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:90%
with a half-mile wide object.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how long do you
think that event would last?

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:84%
From the initial
hit of the asteroid,

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
the shockwave, to the
tsunami, to coming back.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It depends
on the point of origin

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and also the depth of the water.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But it would have
taken a matter of, say,

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
a day for these
tsunamis to go around.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Even as seismic waves,
say, off Indonesia

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
would take a half a day
to get to New Zealand.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
massive obliteration.

00:28:14.428 --> 00:28:15.228 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:28:15.228 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was everywhere,
absolutely everywhere.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I have stories from Australia
from different Aboriginal

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
groups that talk about
the waves coming from--

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and they live in different
parts of the country.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So the people in
north of Australia

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.778 align:middle line:84%
would talk about
this wall of darkness

00:28:27.778 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:84%
coming towards them
that they thought

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:90%
was a cloud, a black cloud.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, oh,
that's not a cloud, that's

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
a big wall of water.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the south part
of Australia were saying, yeah,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a big wave
coming from the north.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they're living in
different parts of the country

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing the
same point of origin

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
of the travel the water, they
can't be making that story up.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So that's why I like
to listen to the old people

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:90%
because they were there.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
They remember these things.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:90%
And they teach people orally.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And the story continues.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.108 align:middle line:84%
And like the Waitaha
of New Zealand,

00:28:56.108 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
they've now just
published it, because they

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
said these things are upon us
and luck favors the prepared.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
So we should prepare.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of Hopi prophecy, Freddy?

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, another
wonderful eyewitness account.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:90%
In fact, if you go back to the--

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it matches.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of these other things.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It matches everything.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Frank Waters, who wrote one
of the best books on the Hopi

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:90%
traditions--

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I love the book--

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the
different points

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and the descriptions of what
these worlds looked like.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And they match what we now know
about the three Ice Age events.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And in one of them,
the last one, the Hopi,

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
who back then were
called the Hisatsinom,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:84%
we know them better
as the Anasazi.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were located where?

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were located
in a place in the middle

00:29:38.435 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:90%
of the Pacific called Kásskara.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.372 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's going to
be a test on this, George.

00:29:42.372 --> 00:29:42.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will I pass?

00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:44.245 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And spelling as well.

00:29:44.245 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And their landmass
was called Kásskara.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if that's
the same as Mu, Lemuria.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.265 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying
that there was

00:29:51.265 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
a group of people called the
ant people, the read ant people.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
called Anu Sinom--

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:90%
so there's the Anunnaki again--

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:29:58.275 --> 00:30:01.055 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Anu Sinom, who helps
them go from island to island

00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and eventually drops
them into safety

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
southwest of America

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.088 align:middle line:90%
where they are today.

00:30:06.088 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:90%
So they're very helpful people.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.172 align:middle line:84%
They've never described the
Anu as being horrible bastards.

00:30:11.172 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:90%
They're always helpful.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
They're always making sure
that people are OK, giving them

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:90%
the right accouterments.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And once they're done,
they disappear back

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:90%
into the unknown.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us

How long have you got?

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is fascinating
for one very good reason.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way it's
aligned to a town, which

is only 20 kilometers away.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody keeps looking at

modern-day Turkey,

00:30:40.518 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:90%
but back then it was in Armenia.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.577 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
learn of the original

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:90%
where this all comes from.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is not
the original name.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.145 align:middle line:90%
The original name is Portasar.

00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So now you have to
learn your Armenian.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So luckily, I have some friends
from that part of the world.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said what does it mean.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And they say,
well, port is easy.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:90%
That's an umbilical cord.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.045 align:middle line:90%
What does asar mean?

00:31:02.045 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:90%
And they said, we don't know.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't exist in Armenian.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know it
does not exist in Armenian

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's Egyptian.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what?

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I says that's the
original name of Osiris.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Osiris is a Greek name.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Asar is the original name.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So you have Gobekli Tepe is
the umbilical cord of Osiris.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going why is it an
umbilical cord of Osiris?

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.838 align:middle line:10%
And why is it so
connected with Osiris

00:31:25.838 --> 00:31:27.130 align:middle line:10%
who's one of the original gods?

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.680 align:middle line:10%
So at that moment,
it's like someone just

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.295 align:middle line:10%
downloads the image into
my head of the pyramids,

00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:10%
and there's a connection between
the pyramids and Gobekli Tepe.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what, 800 miles?

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking what
is the connection?

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.127 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one
of those moments

00:31:40.127 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
where you just thank god that
someone's looking after you.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I began to look
at the pyramids.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought let's take
a line between the corner

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:84%
of the small pyramid and draw it
right through the big pyramid.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And where does it go?

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:90%
It ends up in Gobekli Tepe.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:90%
There's your umbilical cord.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:90%
So the two sides--

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.343 align:middle line:84%
and Giza is supposed to be
the dwelling place of Osiris.

00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And that line goes straight
through the two pyramids

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Gobekli
Tepe, which is also

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.342 align:middle line:90%
the umbilical cord of Osiris.

00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
connects them together

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they are
also called the Watchers.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:84%
They were called the Shining
Ones, followers of Horus,

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.110 align:middle line:84%
who essentially is the
nickname for the Watchers.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And their group happened
to be living in a town

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
just down the road from
Gobekli Tepe called

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Harranu, which means the
meeting place of the Anu.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And that was in 8000 BC.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So I suspect that
the Anu were also

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:84%
involved in the building, or
at least one of the buildings,

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:90%
of Gobekli Tepe.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many,
there's over 60 buildings.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to dig the
whole thing up in our lifetime.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:84%
- Andrew Collins points out
that once the humans left

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the area of Gobekli Tepe, they
spread out all over the world

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.120 align:middle line:84%
with the same system
of civilization.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:10%
- After the closure of
Gobekli Tepe and these

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:10%
settlements began to
spread outwards like waves

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:10%
and created what's known as
the Neolithic Revolution,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:10%
taking with them new
ideas in agriculture,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:10%
animal domestication,
metallurgy,

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.720 align:middle line:10%
the production of alcohol in
the form of wine and beer, stone

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.230 align:middle line:10%
tool technologies.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:10%
These ideas gradually
move southwards as well as

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:10%
westwards, eastwards,
and northwards as well

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and end up going through the
area of the Levant, which today

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:10%
is the countries of
Palestine and Israel,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:10%
and reach Egypt as
early as 8500 BC.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:10%
And that here within sight
of the Great Pyramid,

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:10%
or where it would later be
built, a settlement arose.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:10%
And that amongst these
were highly sophisticated

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:10%
stone tool technologies
which are found identical

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.104 align:middle line:10%
at Gobekli Tepe.

>>NOORY: Why does this
cradle of civilization

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:90%
seem to be so important?

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because we have so much
information leftover from it.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.655 align:middle line:84%
We're lucky enough
to have all the clay

00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
tablets for the Mesopotamians
and the Babylonians

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that were buried that
in 30 feet of mud,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
just like the Egyptians stuff
was buried in so much mud that

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:90%
was able to be preserved.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to use that as a
focal point of civilization.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
actually everywhere.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There were hotspots
everywhere around the globe.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just a place
where something happened

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.139 align:middle line:84%
and then it disseminated
from that spot.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
were nucleus points

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:84%
all around the world that acted
as hotspots of information,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and culture, and civilization.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they sweated out the
information around there.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
The trick is to find out
how they're all connected,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because the only way you're
going to find that out

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:84%
is talking to the
local people about this

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and about their stories.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the more you travel
the world, as I do,

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.068 align:middle line:84%
than we realize that it wasn't
one point of civilization,

00:35:05.068 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
there were at least eight
points of civilization.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.902 align:middle line:84%
And they are all
interconnected, which kind

00:35:08.902 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of almost lines up
with sort of the known

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
places where the
gods used to live.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.105 align:middle line:84%
So this is now being
brought out to the fore.

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't just Atlantis.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just Lemuria.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.480 align:middle line:90%
It was Kásskara.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:84%
There was the
birthplace of the gods.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
These things are
starting to build up

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
into a much more global story.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I think things are much,
much older than we believe.

>>NOORY: What do you think of
the work of Zecharia Sitchin,

about the Anunnaki, the Anu,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.583 align:middle line:10%
coming down here
from another planet?

00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, I mean
you've got to look

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.417 align:middle line:84%
at this as sort of a personal
point of view as well.

00:35:37.417 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean I like Sitchin's
work because without him, I

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.310 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be here.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.518 align:middle line:84%
I mean I read that stuff
when I was getting laid off.

00:35:43.518 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had a few
months of unemployment

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to read all these books,
and I found them riveting.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they are.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They were riveting.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But there are
errors in the work.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like all of
us, no one's perfect.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.687 align:middle line:90%
There were translations.

00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So I guess you have
to take to a point

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:84%
where there's real research and
then there's personal opinion.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So I take a lot of what
he's done and I say, OK.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree with that
because we can back that up.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of it, you put in
that box of I don't know.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.962 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you ask
any of the ancient tribes

00:36:10.962 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:84%
around the world about do
you think these people come

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
from another star
system, they said, well,

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.930 align:middle line:90%
they were here on Earth.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.805 align:middle line:84%
We don't think they came
from somewhere else.

00:36:17.805 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:90%
But they were of the stars.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're always connected
with the belt stars of Orion.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the story
just disappears.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's kind of
correct on some level,

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.297 align:middle line:90%
but we can't really prove it.

00:36:28.297 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's close.

very generalistic.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a small hut where
lives the oldest wisdom

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:90%
keeper of the Cook Islands.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
writing the last book,

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
somehow, someone put
him together with me

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:90%
because I had a missing piece.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't piece all the
gods around the world

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:90%
except for Polynesia.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.610 align:middle line:90%
And he was very gracious.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said let me tell you what
we know about our oral history.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That in about 3000 BC, there
was a rising sea level.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And there was.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The Persian Gulf
eventually gets flooded.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And it displaced
a lot of people.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And he says, there's a group
of people that showed up here,

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and they've been coming
here for a long time, called

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:90%
the Tupanaki.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that
sounds very familiar.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, you know them
by another name the Anunnaki.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here they come again.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I went the Anunnaki
were in the Cook-- yes, they've

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
been here for a long time.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And in fact--

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were the
red ant people, too.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they were also the
ancestry to the red ant people.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you
go to Easter Island,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
there's a mound there
called Anu Hananakou.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is, the Anu
Hananakou, which is

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.807 align:middle line:90%
the platform named after them.

00:37:57.807 --> 00:37:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But I said that's not
what I'm looking into.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at the big flood.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell me
about the big flood?

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we can tell you--

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
the flood of Moses?

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Noah.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The big flood 9700 BC.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
back then these people

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.840 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki were living on a
circular island in the Indian

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And my jaw was just dropping.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, where it?

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you won't
find it because the earth was

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:90%
submerged.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.032 align:middle line:90%
140 feet sea level went up.

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's Atlantis.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Lands came down.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Lands went up.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It's now in the general area
of where exists the Arabian

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.795 align:middle line:84%
Peninsula, because that
came out of the ocean

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and their island went down.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.253 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been looking
for the place of the Anunnaki

00:38:34.253 --> 00:38:35.190 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.900 align:middle line:90%
They call it [NON-ENGLISH].

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:84%
We've never really
identified it.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this
wonderful person,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:84%
who I think he
must be 60 by now,

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
he confides in me that, yes,
we have the oral tradition

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Anunnaki living on
a circular island called

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Te Petaka, where
it now somewhere

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
in the region of the
Arabian Peninsula.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we have an
actual record of where

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the Anunnaki used to live.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It is incredible.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I never would have expected
that come out of the blue.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
working on next, Freddy?

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Trying to get on
a plane with some beverages

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what you want?

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'm
working on something

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that kind of is a bit different,
but then it always is.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
prehistory of Scotland

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.307 align:middle line:84%
and the Western
Isles of Scotland,

00:39:18.307 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
because I found so much of the
culture, the megalithic culture

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:90%
of Scotland in Sardinia.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And those two never go together.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I just did a
documentary on it.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:10%
And usually, you do a
documentary after the book.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:10%
I put the cart before the horse.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:10%
But it's got me thinking because
I'm looking at the original

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:10%
story of the people
who settled there,

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:10%
which turns out to be
the gods of Ireland,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:10%
the Tuatha Dé Danaan, who are
none other than the Tuadhe

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.410 align:middle line:10%
d'Anu, who are none
other than the Anunnaki.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:10%
So within 5,000 years of
moving from the Middle

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.380 align:middle line:10%
East and the area
around Mount Ararat,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:10%
they went through the Danube
River, which bears their name,

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.740 align:middle line:10%
through Denmark, which
bears their name,

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:10%
through the Nordic regions.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
physiognomy of the people

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Nordic regions bears
their physical structure--

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:84%
very tall, blond, light skinned,
just as they were described

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient people.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
populated Orkney,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:90%
which was ice free at the time.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And they moved south
towards Ireland.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And they became the gods
of Ireland around 4000 BC.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm following that
trajectory of what

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.553 align:middle line:84%
happened to the young
Anunnaki, because they

00:40:23.553 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
did become the
bloodline of Europe

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.590 align:middle line:90%
after many thousands of years.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.315 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:40:29.315 --> 00:40:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
ancient history.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:10%
But to think of
just how many gods

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:10%
we had on this planet
a long time ago

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.480 align:middle line:10%
and how it has affected us
today, truly remarkable.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
