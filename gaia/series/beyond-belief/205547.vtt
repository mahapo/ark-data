>>GEORGE NOORY: What is
it about matchmaking that

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.358 align:middle line:90%
is satisfying for you?

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARLA MARTENSON: I get to
meet so many amazing people

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from all different backgrounds,
and everybody wants love.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.488 align:middle line:84%
Matchmaking can get a
little shallow sometimes

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:84%
in what people are
looking for, and I

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:84%
like that spiritual
aspect to balance it out.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I get some intuition, and
I'll even send energy healing

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to my clients.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't you
match up a woman

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
with a prominent owner of
a professional sports team

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.795 align:middle line:84%
and they ended up
getting married?

Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We've got a fascinating
guest for you.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:10%
Marla Martenson based
out of Los Angeles

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:10%
is a professional matchmaker.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Marla is also a life
coach, energy healer,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and intuitive reader.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Marla.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Hi, George.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in matchmaking?

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh my gosh.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It was a fluke.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.303 align:middle line:10%
It's so interesting, because
people always want to know,

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
is this something you
always wanted to do?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:10%
But I was an actress/waitress
for the first 20 years

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:10%
of my life.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:10%
I was doing TV commercials,
modeling, little gigs

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:10%
and things.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:10%
And then when I was 39, I had
a pivotal point in my life

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:10%
where my father passed
away from cancer.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I usually ended up
waiting on tables

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:90%
more than I was acting, right?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, I
need something else.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Please, you know, I
was praying to God.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd go in churches and leave
little notes, you know?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing all this
affirmations and stuff.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I'm going to
do, what skills that I have,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
but I want to do
something different.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I first
met Adolfo, my husband.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And he had a friend who was
taking over the management

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
position at a video
dating service and said,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
hey, if you want a part-time
gig, we need somebody.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
at this place.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I was the videographer.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It was doing videos and
working the front desk.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I went over
to a Beverly Hills matchmaking

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.653 align:middle line:84%
service, which was the
high-end, the more--

00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very upscale.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Upscale.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up working
there for seven years.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Started writing books, because
I had to still be creative

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
since I'd dropped the acting.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2010, I
went out on my own

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and started my own
matchmaking service

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:90%
with a business partner.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:90%
What is a soul mate?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
We hear so many
different definitions.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
a soul mate is?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, I think
that we travel in soul groups.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.772 align:middle line:84%
So you and Adolfo, you
know, you guys are friends.

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's my buddy.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.188 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah,
he's your buddy.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
You guys maybe have had
past lives together.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:90%
My dog Macy's a soul mate.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:90%
So we go in soul groups.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes one
of these people

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.587 align:middle line:84%
could be a romantic interest,
and they can come in,

00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and that's your soul mate.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And I think really, it's more--

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in the romantic
sense, it's somebody

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
great affinity with

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and that you're going to
have great lessons to learn

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
together and be together.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're soul
to soul, you know?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear so many
people complain afterwards

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that if they have a breakup
in their relationship,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.475 align:middle line:84%
they're distraught because
they think, oh my god.

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I've lost my soul mate.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Was that person intended
to be a soul mate?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah,
well, a soul mate

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.337 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that you're
always going-- you're going

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to stay together for life.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They could come in for a
certain purpose, to teach--

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:90%
it's always--

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
it's always going to
teach you something.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it doesn't
mean just one person.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Doesn't
mean just one person,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's not always
going to be easy.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, my
soul mate, we're

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:90%
going to do everything the same.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:90%
We're going to think the same.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.465 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cut our
carrots the same way.

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] They're going
to show you some things

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that you need to learn some
lessons, life lessons, soul

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
lessons.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
match people, what

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:90%
are you trying to look for?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you actually look
at the personalities of the two

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
individuals?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.515 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, since the men
are my paying clients and men

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:49.315 align:middle line:90%
are so visual--

00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] so first,
I've got to look

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.765 align:middle line:84%
at the looks type they like,
the location, the age range.

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a religious
background they're looking for.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Do they want kids?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Do they have kids?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, George, with this
political climate we have--

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
never in my life did I have
to ask political affiliation

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.915 align:middle line:90%
or preference, and--

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That comes up now?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
There'll be-- somebody
maybe is a liberal and says,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.157 align:middle line:84%
I would never date
a conservative.

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
A conservative says, I
won't date a liberal.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And it gets pretty-- it
could be heated on a date.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
So I have to screen
for that now.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.039 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
any of it by computer?

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, I
hand-match everybody,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:84%
but I send them their
matches by text or on email.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your success rate?

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: All right.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Interesting question.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So success rate
could really mean

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm successful in
setting the client up

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
with the type of person
they're looking for.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think people mean success
rate, how many people get

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
married, stay in a relationship?

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.727 align:middle line:90%
Second date, third date?

00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: I've had a lot of--

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
over the years,
two decades-- a lot

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of marriages, a lot of
people in relationships.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
And then sometimes they won't.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.713 align:middle line:84%
If they're too picky,
they've got a list too long,

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're not really going
to get into a relationship.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I've had some over
the years, couples

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
get married, got
divorced, and then

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.368 align:middle line:90%
they came and signed up again.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
tempting for you, when

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
you meet people who are friends
of, let's say, your husband,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:90%
trying to match them up?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you go beyond
the call of duty?

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, I haven't
had any of my husband's friends

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
as clients, but I have tried
to help a couple of them.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
you know, you want

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:90%
to see our friends be happy.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'll do that.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I play Cupid, you know?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's hard not-- it's
hard to shut it off.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You fling arrows?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
hit a few, once.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: I hit some.

00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people
appreciative of what you do?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm bringing a
healing to people in a way,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
because even if they don't end
up in a long-term relationship,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
it's that relationship
that we have.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they get some
coaching from me

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
or some healing or a different
perspective in some way.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And you know, they really are--

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
it's very rewarding for me.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has
been really one

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most satisfying
things you've done,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
a story that you
can relate for us?

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh, yeah.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was this one couple.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
This was a couple where
I knew immediately.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:84%
When the man joined, I
said, I-- and he told me--

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
the right person.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
When he told me what he
was looking for, I said,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:90%
I have the right lady.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I introduced them and we ended
up going to their wedding.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.117 align:middle line:90%
Adolfo played music.

00:06:15.117 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They had five different
musical-- they had a harp,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:90%
they had piano, they had--

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
A gift for me there,
champagne toast.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It was just beautiful.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was really exciting.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it worked.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: It worked.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
still together?

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: [LAUGHS]
That was back--

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
that was, like, 15 years
ago, and you know what?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:90%
They are not still together.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:90%
But it was a beautiful--

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, while it
lasted, it was great.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regina
Meredith runs a show

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia called "Open Minds."

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
She talked with Arielle
Ford, whom I think you know,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
about finding love.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Ever since the addition

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
of new age culture
to society, it

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.875 align:middle line:84%
seems to have almost
created a greater divide.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE FORD: Yes.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It hasn't done
what it was supposed to do,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
which is to create
bridges to one another.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.525 align:middle line:84%
It's created a tremendous
amount of spiritual arrogance.

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: And judgment.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.442 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: And judgment.

00:07:07.442 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And the truth
is, men experience

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and express spirituality
differently than we do.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So we may want to sit
in the Mile High Church,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
at the Unity Church,
and read certain books.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:10%
And if your guy is
coaching Little League

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and volunteering at Big Brothers
and helping your mother get

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:10%
in and out of the
car and just being

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:10%
an all-around good
human being, what could

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.495 align:middle line:10%
be more spiritual than that?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.528 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: You know, and yet,
when I talk to single women,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they say is, oh,
well, I want a spiritual guy.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.152 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I've
heard this so often.

00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:44.065 align:middle line:84%
And most of those people
actually are alone.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yes.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.755 align:middle line:10%
They're alone with their
"Conversations with God"

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:10%
books and their workbooks
and their practices

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.375 align:middle line:10%
and their chanting.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:10%
You know, I had
this conversation

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:10%
with Elizabeth Gilbert who
wrote "Eat, Pray, Love."

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, what do you
love most about your husband?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
my history was

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to be with guys who would go
to meditation retreats with me.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
She said, but my husband
is never going to do yoga.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:90%
He's never going to meditate.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
He's certainly never
doing a green juice fast.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But when I walk into
a room, his eyes

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
light up like it's
Christmas morning.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:10%
And he takes me by the hand
and leads me into the kitchen,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:10%
and he puts my feet up and
he hands me a glass of wine,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:10%
and then he cooks me dinner.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Mm.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:90%
That's divine, right?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: And she's happy.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And she understands that she
is a meditating, chanting,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
green juice fasting kind
of girl, and he is not.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
But he loves her.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:10%
He's devoted to her.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:10%
He's crazy about her.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:10%
And who wouldn't want that?

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:10%
And yet, by most people's
standards, is he's spiritual?

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, in his own way.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Because he puts all that love in
the food, which he feeds to her

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.932 align:middle line:90%
to nourish her body and soul.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Is she spot on?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, that
describes me and my husband.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm the green juice woo-woo
woman, and Adolfo's not.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Although he's very into
crystals right now,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:90%
and he's studying them.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I've given him a
lot of crystals.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:90%
He's learning about them.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
But no, he's the pool man.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:90%
He mows the lawn.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:90%
He fixes everything.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.650 align:middle line:90%
He takes care of stuff.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
He's very romantic.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He plays the piano.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.485 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Plays the
piano, writes me love songs.

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But no, he's not
into all the stuff.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But as the years have gone
by, I read Tarot cards now,

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:90%
which he was against--

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You dabble
with the Ouija board.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh, no.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.072 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
bring that one up, huh?

00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:90%
No, you know what?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the Ouija, but I do
like the talking board, which

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.747 align:middle line:84%
the Ouija has that
brand, you know?

00:09:42.747 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it fun to
find the right partner?

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Is it
fun for me to find

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
the right partner for people?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy that?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, me and
my business partner Fredly,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
we'll start doing what
we call a happy dance.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
If we make a match and they're
in love or they're exclusive,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
we're like, happy dance.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
We turn on some music and
we dance and celebrate.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the demographics

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of people looking for love?

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: For us in
our business lately,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
it's really been the
men are mid 50s and up.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:90%
60s, 70s.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
We have a couple younger
guys, but it's really mostly

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:90%
been the older guys.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And I like helping those guys.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are guys who are divorced
or maybe even never married.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:90%
But I do like that demographic.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in St.
Louis over the week,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking outside of
the window of a restaurant

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
on the patio, and I
see a guy that I'm

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
sure I knew because I
used to work with him.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
He was my CPA years
and years ago.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at him and
I'm going, is that Oscar?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And I sent a couple
waitresses out.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid to
say, are you Oscar?

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:90%
But he was with an older lady.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I went outside and I
look at him and I'm saying,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
sure enough, that's
him 20 years later.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It's been 20 years
since I've known him.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I went, Oscar?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Then he went, George!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
It was him.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
He's 93 years old
and he was on a date

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:84%
with a woman who
was in her late 70s.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were
having a good time.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that's important
as people get older,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:90%
not to shut yourself off.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.845 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and go on a date.

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Have a lovely meal.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.068 align:middle line:90%
It's never too late.

00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
people looking for?

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking
for a relationship?

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking
for companionship?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:90%
What do they need?

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.862 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well,
with our business,

00:11:29.862 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
we only take on
people who are looking

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
for a long-term
relationship or marriage.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just a
hookup or dating service.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It's really serious.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So everybody who comes to
us does want that soul mate

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent
of people want that?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.995 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I
think most people.

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Especially women, because
the guys will say,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:90%
are your women serious?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
What woman doesn't want her
prince coming on a white horse?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really in
our heart, we're

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
not really-- the women
don't tend to be wanting

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:90%
to juggle all these men.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They really want to
find that right person.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Now the men, however,
maybe they've

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:90%
had a divorce or something.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Then they kind of want
to test the waters

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:90%
and go have some fun.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they're
a little leery.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: A little more.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you push them
basically into going out?

00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, if
they come to us and pay,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that means they're
ready and they want to.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes they'll think.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
reject what you pick?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they will.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I've had guys--

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I have a guy right now.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
He's rejected 28
of my selections.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 28?

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: 28.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has he
accepted any of them?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.863 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: He has.

00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
He's met about eight
and he's rejected 20--

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
because they have
to see the photo.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:90%
And they're so darned visual.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.625 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I wish I could--

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But people
are that way.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: People
are that way.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So you just keep
going, you know?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.638 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People are that way.

00:12:41.638 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Of the eight he ended up
meeting or going out with,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.135 align:middle line:90%
how many has he seen since then?

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I'm
still looking for him.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:90%
He's very specific.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the guys that
I take on are so specific.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes I say, I'm
a matchmaker, not a magician,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my best.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then other guys are
so easy, and they end up

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship right away.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So it really depends on what
roadblocks they're putting up.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes guys think I really
want to date a supermodel.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They'll send me a name
of an Instagram girl

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
who has a million followers
or a model and say,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:90%
can you track her down for me?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.555 align:middle line:84%
One time a guy sent me a
picture of a model and said,

00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
do you think you
could find her for me?

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I'd like to date her.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Find that model?

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: That person.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
her and I said, I

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
think she's dating Leonardo
DiCaprio right now.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't think you've got
really a chance with that one.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.723 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you never know.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: You
never know, you know?

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to--

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
go seeking people?

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.842 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you find
the guy and the woman?

00:13:44.842 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: So the men will
come to us from word of mouth.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of our clients,
they'll send

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:90%
their friends or various ways.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have read my
books or seen my website.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Now the women, I've been
doing it so long that-- well,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm still getting from
the episode I was on--

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2013 here.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I still get some ladies
contacting me from that

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.183 align:middle line:90%
But they'll maybe read my books.

00:14:07.183 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I have a podcast.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
I have a YouTube show.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:90%
We have recruiters.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
There's probably about a dozen
ways women will come to us.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lisa Garr on Gaia's
program "Inspirations"

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
interviewed Barbara De
Angelis about people finding

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the way they wanted to love.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA DE ANGELIS: Being
in pain, having regret, being

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
angry, feeling
disappointed have nothing

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
to do with feeling love.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So many times in our
life-- and all of us

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this,
from the time we first

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
get hurt as a child,
something happens,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
someone disappoints us, someone
hurts us or doesn't love us

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:90%
the way we think they should.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And we end up in a sense
freezing a piece of our heart,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
freezing a piece
of our emotions.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a block of ice.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Something else happens and
there's another block of ice.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Bit by bit, block
by block, we end up

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
with frozen ice walls
around our heart.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Our love can't get out.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Other people's can't get in.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Just like water
doesn't disappear,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
H2O doesn't disappear when
it's in the form of ice,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.188 align:middle line:90%
it's the same substance.

00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:13.355 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Different form.

00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:14.897 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: --but
it needs to melt.

00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:17.442 align:middle line:84%
Love can take the form
of resistance, of anger,

00:15:17.442 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
of being shut off, et cetera.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So choosing to love, meaning
to feel the love, even

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
when we're hurt, even
when we're disappointed

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great
spiritual choices.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you choose
to let somebody hurt you

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%
or you even stay with someone.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But to sacrifice
our own lovingness.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.625 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
watching have done that.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They can go, you know what?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Ever since this happened, I've
been afraid to love again,

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But that love is
what nourishes us.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Love in the form
of our heart energy

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is the form of relationship.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
In the form of energy up
here, it's creativity.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
That source makes us juicy.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It makes us flow in life.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
need to go through what

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I call the big melt,
because they've

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:90%
gotten crusty and frozen.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the big melt?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: A melting that--

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
ice around the heart--

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a melting of love?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I think
it's a melting into love.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of people will say,
well, my last relationship,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I found out the person
was an alcoholic

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:90%
or they cheated on me.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a narcissist.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.588 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Or a narcissist.

00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
That's a big thing
nowadays, the narcissist.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So then they're afraid to get
into a relationship again.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's where you kind
of go back and look at maybe

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%
some childhood patterns.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say you were a child

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and your parents argued all the
time, and it was just very--

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you witnessed that.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.257 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: And
you witnessed it,

00:16:40.257 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there was even
some physical altercations.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in the back of
your subconscious, you're

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
thinking, well, being in a
relationship, being married's

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.610 align:middle line:90%
dangerous.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's dramatic.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.628 align:middle line:84%
When you get older
and you're looking,

00:16:53.628 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, yeah, well,
I want a relationship.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm online.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I've hired a
matchmaker, whatever.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So you say, you maybe think
you want a relationship,

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
but that program's
running in the background.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not safe.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So then you'll pick
unavailable people.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, let's talk a
little bit about obsessions,

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
because I have known
people who become obsessed

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.763 align:middle line:90%
with the other person.

00:17:18.763 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh, yeah.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's not
healthy for both people.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:90%
What causes that?

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it an insecurity?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
We've got to work on self-love.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It's those patterns
from childhood.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody-- anybody
you talk to will

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
have something that
happened in childhood,

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
whether they were bullied
or maybe they were abused

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's that codependence.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
glomming on to someone.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And I do readings too.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I work on a couple of
psychic hotlines now,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:90%
George, for fun, you know?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I get a lot of calls
from women who want to know,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:90%
is my ex coming back?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Is he thinking about me?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they want him?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.353 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: They want him back.

00:17:56.353 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I never knew so many women
were wanting their exes back,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
even if he's with somebody--
he had cheated on her

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.267 align:middle line:90%
and gone with somebody else.

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And they still call
me and say, but do you

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:90%
think he'll come back?

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we do some cord cutting,
those energetic cords, energy

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
work, because we have
cords that are attached,

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
especially if we've been
intimate, that attach us.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you
think about when

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking about somebody
and then they call, you know?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love
that, that intuition.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because we have
cords attached to us that form.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So I take them through
a cord cutting.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.423 align:middle line:84%
I call in Archangel Michael and
cut those cords and release.

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
They've got to do some
releasing work and then

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
some self-love work
and maybe some energy

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
healing and self-esteem
work and boundary work.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But some people don't want
to do the work on themselves.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
call a psychic.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
When's the person
coming in my life?

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.517 align:middle line:84%
One person even asked, I want
to know what my future husband's

00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
name is, what he looks
like, where he lives,

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:90%
and how old he is.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.777 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: And then I
said, well, I'm not Kreskin.

00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I don't know.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But do the work on yourself,
because frequency is always

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:90%
matched.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
make people happy.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I
make people-- yeah.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they
come back to you

00:19:05.522 --> 00:19:09.167 align:middle line:84%
after the fact, either
couple, and thank you?

00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Sometimes,
and then sometimes I

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.692 align:middle line:84%
find out through the grapevine
that they got married

00:19:13.692 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and went off into the sunset.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I never even knew about it.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They never told you?

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: No.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I think--
you know what I think?

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
They're just so happy in
their life, they just--

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:90%
and that's fine.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't need the thanks.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm just happy that
I was able to do it.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
you're an enlightened person.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.045 align:middle line:84%
You're the Beverly
Hills matchmaker.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:90%
That was your first--

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well,
now my moniker--

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.648 align:middle line:84%
I was the Beverly
Hills matchmaker.

00:19:35.648 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I moved to the
Valley, and now I

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
call myself the
mystical matchmaker.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
What is it about
matchmaking that

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:90%
is satisfying for you, Marla?

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, I get to
meet so many amazing people

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
from all different backgrounds,
and what they're doing

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:90%
is so interesting.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And then just helping them
find that special person.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants love.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you rejected
paying clients before?

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh, yes.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do you reject them?

00:20:02.673 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, if
they're too out of reality.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a guy's
65 and he says, look,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.515 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to date anyone over
30, or he has too many things--

00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His goals
are way out of line.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll say, look, we
can't do-- it's too hard

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.352 align:middle line:90%
or it's not realistic.

00:20:17.352 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they depressed
when they walk out?

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.303 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: No.

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a guy will
say, you're rejecting me?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:22.985 align:middle line:90%
I want to-- you know--

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've got the cash.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: But if
we can't help them,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.465 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to want
their money back anyway.

00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able
to sleep at night.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
If I can't help him, I
don't want to take him on.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I only want to take on
people that I can potentially

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:90%
get into a relationship.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Buddha
Made Me Do it."

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.205 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTENSON: "The
Buddha Made Me Do it:

00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:10%
A Field Guide to EnLITEnment,"
is my spiritual memoir.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:10%
And that was--

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:10%
I had written a couple of
other memoirs before that.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.163 align:middle line:84%
And Adolfo and I had moved
into a house from Hollywood.

00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:90%
We went to the Valley.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had this little
Buddha statuette

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that somebody had given me.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A big belly.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.517 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, it was the
little one, like-- you know.

00:21:00.517 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was made of wood.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was decluttering,
and I got rid of it.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even Adolfo's.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But he said, hey, Marla, where
is that Buddha statue at?

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
What happened to it?

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Did you get rid of it?

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You better not have
gotten rid of it.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.698 align:middle line:84%
That's just like you to get
rid of stuff without asking me.

00:21:14.698 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm not
going to admit that I--

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
in the garage packed.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll find it.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.893 align:middle line:84%
I started driving around
to all the spiritual--

00:21:21.893 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To find the Buddha.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.768 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: To replace
it, the same one.

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I went to all these
spiritual hotspots.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find it.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
He kept asking about it, so
I went to one last place.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
a Buddha, but they

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
had classes every
Wednesday night

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.990 align:middle line:84%
on connecting with your
guides, crystal healing,

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:90%
opening your intuition.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I called my friend
Julie and I said, hey,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't find any Buddhas.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
She was my BFF
that lived nearby.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, do you
want to take a class?

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
We started taking these classes.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We got so hooked,
George, that we started

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
taking classes all over town.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And pendulums and
candle magic, and I

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
became a Reiki practitioner
and crystal healer.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was deep diving.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And Adolfo's like,
what's going on?

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I've been
taking it further.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I just got so--

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
it's been so much fun.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was really the Buddha
statuette that made me do it.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever find the Buddha?

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: No.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never again?

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: No.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think Adolfo only
found out the true story

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
when I was on "Coast" and we
talked about it, because I

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
never--

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to admit it.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
admit it to him.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: And he
wasn't upset, you know?

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd the book sell?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: The
book is doing good.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have a new book coming out
I think December, this December

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
2021 called "The Magic Seeker."

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.828 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The Magic Seeker."

00:22:35.828 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: It's
a spiritual memoir.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Again, I go even
deeper where I meet

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
a trans channel called Riz
who channels an Indian guide

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%
called Red Eagle.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most magical
experience of my life

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
when I went to this
circle of light

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and this Indian
spirit spoke to me.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And he told me.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:84%
The first time-- this was
two years ago in June.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And my spirit guides-- he
talked to your spirit guides

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and he says, your spirit
guides are saying write, write,

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:90%
write, write, write.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- like,
started crying,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.437 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't written
anything since "Buddha,"

00:23:10.437 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I should
have been writing.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.937 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Marla,
you've got a lot in there.

00:23:13.937 --> 00:23:14.968 align:middle line:90%
Keep writing.

00:23:14.968 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wrote "The Magic
Seeker," because Red Eagle told

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
me to, and it's
going to be great.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an interest
still in the occult, don't you?

00:23:21.782 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: I love it.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I can't get enough.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's
a lifetime thing.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
interesting facets of it.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it helped
your matchmaking?

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: It does,
because my matchmaking can

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
get a little shallow sometimes
in what people are looking for,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and I like that spiritual
aspect to balance it out.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I get some
intuition, and I'll even

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.577 align:middle line:84%
send energy healing to
my clients, distanced.

00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have
to know about it.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to
imbue that energy.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What practices
do you use for yourself?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I use energy
healing a lot on myself.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
I like to work with crystals.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll pull a card.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I like to use my pendulum.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll check maybe
on my own health

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.318 align:middle line:90%
if I feel something's off.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pendulums are amazing.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.725 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I gave
Adolfo a pendulum,

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
a rose quartz one the other day,
because it was an extra one.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you do
the yes, no with him?

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Yes, and I
taught him how to program it.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:90%
He loves it.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:90%
He's getting into--

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a lie detector.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.198 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: It's really fun.

00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was at a party a long
time ago, and I had a pendulum.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a piece of paper,
and I put yes, yes, right?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And no, no on the paper.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have people
with their elbow on the table

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:90%
hold the pendulum.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, make it stop.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Put it right in the
middle, but make it stop.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And it stopped.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It just sat there.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Then I said, now think no.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And after a few seconds,
it swayed back and forth.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Then I said, now think yes.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It would slow down
and go like that.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
were doing it were

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
in marvel, because there's
some kind of reaction

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
through your body
that's doing it.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.175 align:middle line:84%
And you're not aware of
it, but it's happening.

00:24:59.175 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah, it does.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you tune
them up to the yes and no,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:84%
you can ask them all kinds
of yes and no questions.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
they're trying to think,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:90%
the real answer will pop up.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing it as a gag.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a party.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
All these people around
and couples are there

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:90%
and friends are there.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just threw
out, did you ever

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
have an affair on your wife?

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.418 align:middle line:90%
And it goes, yes.

00:25:25.418 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of the marriage.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh my gosh.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He dropped the
thing he walked out.

00:25:29.643 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Wow.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:90%
What a story.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to keep
your mind kind of blank,

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
want to influence,

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.937 align:middle line:84%
because you might want a
certain answer to come out.

00:25:39.937 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little
challenge to practice with,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.757 align:middle line:90%
to keep that neutral.

00:25:43.757 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's great.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Now on Gaia's "Healing
Matrix," Dr. Sue Morter

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
talked with a psychologist
about that moment

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.795 align:middle line:90%
that she realized she was there.

00:25:55.795 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAMINI JAIN: The first
one really that turned me

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:10%
into just--

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:10%
I'd say a devout seeker of
understanding energy medicine

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:10%
and its power in
fostering healing

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:10%
was my own first experience
as a client where

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:10%
I just hopped on a table and
experienced a Reiki session.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.475 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:10%
I'd always had a
really deep connection

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:10%
with sound and vibration,
because I grew up singing.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.450 align:middle line:10%
I've always loved to
sing, so I'm a singer.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:10%
So I knew about
the power of that,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.883 align:middle line:10%
and I explored the
power of mantra.

00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:10%
But I just couldn't
wrap my head around,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:10%
how could I study this in a deep
way beyond just brain changes?

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:10%
Which was cool, but not
really what I was seeking.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:10%
I was seeking to understand
the nature of vibration.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:10%
And I remember being on
that Reiki table and all

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:10%
of a sudden, I was
feeling all this energy

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:10%
going through my body.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:10%
And I could notice
where the knots were

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:10%
and how those knots were
connected to old belief systems

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and thought patterns
and emotions that I had

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:10%
and what needed to be released.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
the moment where I

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:10%
had a conscious decision
in myself to say,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.028 align:middle line:10%
I'm letting go of this,
and the energy just flowed.

00:26:58.028 --> 00:26:59.195 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE MORTER: And just went.

00:26:59.195 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: And just went.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, you know, of
course, my scientific mind

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:10%
was like, this is really neat.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I just felt this!

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this was
completely palpable.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:10%
I've never felt like this.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And there's such a
profound connection

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:10%
here with the emotions
and the belief systems.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.375 align:middle line:10%
This has to be studyable.

00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:10%
So that's really where the light
went on in my mind and I said,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:10%
we've got to study this
on a scientific level.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:10%
It's so powerful.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It could help so many people.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember-- tell
me if my memory's right.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you match up a woman
with a prominent owner

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of a professional sports
team and they ended up

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:90%
getting married?

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I think you did.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I don't
remember that one.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: There's
been so many.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can't-- I mean,
I'm not going to mention

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:90%
their names.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Right.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I'm
pretty sure it was you.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Maybe.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It sounds familiar.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That person mentioned
you and they started dating.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.833 align:middle line:84%
And here's another example
where once you match them,

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:90%
they don't come back to you.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: They don't.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've heard people--

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.132 align:middle line:84%
oh, they had a baby and
everything, you know?

00:27:58.132 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Then other people, it's
great when they send me

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
a picture of their baby or their
wedding or something like that.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the strangest thing

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%
you've encountered matchmaking?

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Oh my gosh.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, I mean, I have--

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you can say on--

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Right.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Strangest.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:19.398 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have funny ones
where this one woman flew out

00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to Florida to meet this guy,
because some of the guys--

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who paid
for the flight?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: He did.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They'll fly the
women in and have

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:90%
them stay at a hotel and stuff.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And they went to this
upscale event at the hotel.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman got so drunk
that he had to wheel her out

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:90%
on the luggage cart.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah!

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.617 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So this is
one tip I always give.

00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, be careful about
how much alcohol you consume.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.435 align:middle line:90%
Women tend to be lightweights.

00:28:45.435 --> 00:28:46.560 align:middle line:90%
You're having a great time.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:90%
You're drinking.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, I've had a woman argue
about politics with one guy,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.532 align:middle line:90%
get up and walk out.

00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Different things will happen.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So be careful about that
alcohol consumption.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
right about that.

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I've seen alcohol turn
people into monsters.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They kick people
and everything else.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:02.675 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: [LAUGHS] So
I hear some funny stories.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, what keeps you going?

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, I mean, I
have a great business partner,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Fredly, and a great
recruiter, Sandy.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
And we've just got a great team.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And it just gets so exciting
when we get these new people

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
in, and they maybe had a
heartbreak, a bad divorce,

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe their wife
or husband died.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And we get to help them
infuse that excitement

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:90%
and love again into their life.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.888 align:middle line:90%
So I really enjoy it.

00:29:30.888 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most magical moment for you?

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Oh, the most
magical moment was connecting

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
with that channeler who
channels Red Eagle and talking--

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:90%
actually talking to this spirit.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm real big into channelers,
because thinking about talking

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to an entity that's coming
through that's in a different

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
dimension or an ET or
something-- like, you know,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:90%
there's--

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a channeler?

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well,
I channel my--

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I channel my angel, Thomas.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
He's a guide, and I
can bring him through.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thomas?

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah,
his name's Thomas.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like my producer.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: I know.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't call him
Tommy, but Thomas.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
But I do get messages.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I've given a lot of
messages from Thomas.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.582 align:middle line:90%
And people say that--

00:30:08.582 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I say, I want feedback.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And they say, it resonates.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
know his name was Thomas?

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.475 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: He said
it on the board.

00:30:14.475 --> 00:30:16.058 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I met him on the board.

00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Ouija board?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, it's
not-- it wasn't a Ouija--

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You call
it a talking board.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.303 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Because
it's not a brand Ouija.

00:30:21.303 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just a board
with the alphabet.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm like Kar--

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it looks
like a Ouija board.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.543 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Hey, my girlfriend
Karen Dahlman, you know,

00:30:26.543 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we always say we can write
the alphabet on a paper bag

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:90%
and it'll work.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The devil's is
going to take Karen one day,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:90%
you know that.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: No.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] She's such
a wonderful gal.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She is, but she
dabbles with the dark side.

00:30:39.572 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: You think
it's dark, though,

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:90%
just because it's a board, or--

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.592 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: She
does everything so--

00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think strange spirits
can come through a Ouija board.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be careful.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she swears
by it, as you know.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Right.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.315 align:middle line:84%
Because we're only
working with the light.

00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
We're not thinking of that.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Now if somebody used it when
they're under the influence--

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.860 align:middle line:84%
drugs, alcohol, not taking
it seriously, not treating it

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.630 align:middle line:90%
respectfully-- something could.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you intuitive?

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.935 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Yes,
we're all intuitive.

00:31:06.935 --> 00:31:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did any of these
practices enhance that?

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: You know,
what opened me up

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.152 align:middle line:84%
and the way I got to
connect with my angel Thomas

00:31:12.152 --> 00:31:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is what she was talking
about, the last clip, Reiki,

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:90%
the energetic attunements.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What exactly is Reiki?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: So it's
an energy healing

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.970 align:middle line:90%
modality that comes from Japan.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is a Reiki
master will attune you

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:90%
with the symbols.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll put the symbols
into your energy field.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it was so interesting,
because I'd feel immediately

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
when I was studying Reiki
and the buzzing in my hands,

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the tingling, the
flow of the energy.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I had some other
energetic attachments

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
from different people,
and I really noticed,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that's what opened me
up to be more intuitive,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:90%
having messages come through.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Having a quiet mind and being
calm is very important too.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you used
these intuitive abilities

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.525 align:middle line:84%
to match people or
not match people?

00:32:00.525 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: A little bit.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:84%
With the matching, it's still
so much of the first things.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Location, age range,
looks, background,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:90%
now political this and that.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.463 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as much--
it's like, OK, well,

00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:84%
we've got everything on
paper that looks good.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Now it's up to you guys to
see if there's chemistry.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:90%
So not as much.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it is
an ability for you,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:90%
because you're very intuitive.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I have been nurturing
that over the years.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
have that ability?

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.467 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Everybody does.

00:32:28.467 --> 00:32:31.780 align:middle line:84%
That's our intuition
that we're born with.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our makeup.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the
"Inspirations" show,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
our friendly Lisa Garr
once again interviewed

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual teacher,
Sonia Choquette,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
about these intuitive abilities.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SONIA CHOQUETTE: We are
all born with a sixth sense,

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.300 align:middle line:90%
because it's your heart.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:10%
It is the first
organ in your body

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:10%
to develop, way
before your brain,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:10%
way before your other senses.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:10%
The second organ to
develop in your body

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:10%
is the cochlear, the inner ear.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And those two pick up energy and
vibration, and that informs us.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:10%
People don't know
this, but every one

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:10%
of your physical senses goes
through the ear into the heart.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:10%
So your heart is
your guidance system,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:10%
and we lose it because
we are conditioned--

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:10%
the majority of the planet
has been conditioned

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:10%
to ignore that inner wisdom.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:90%
But we all start out with it.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Hmm.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.473 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because if you
think about a baby in a womb,

00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:84%
they can pick up the
feelings of the mother.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOQUETTE: Very much so.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:10%
And they're hearing everything.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:10%
We are very conscious.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:10%
And your heart is a very
intelligent, very informing

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.057 align:middle line:10%
organ.

00:33:43.057 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of this ability, Marla?

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you've got that ability.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I love
Sonia Choquette.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Her teachings are great.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.255 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, you just use it--

00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wanted to be
able to give readings.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.672 align:middle line:84%
That's something I wanted to
do, because I'd see other people

00:33:57.672 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
doing it, and I just had that--

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.125 align:middle line:84%
I did some plant
medicine journeys

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:90%
over the last few years as well.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It helps open things up.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:90%
We do have the inner ear.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We have the third eye and
we have the third ear,

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:84%
where we get those-- we
can hear those messages.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think this
has helped your matchmaking

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.508 align:middle line:90%
abilities?

00:34:15.508 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, it helps me
understand people a little bit

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
more and have more
compassion, because we all

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:84%
come from a place of some
pain in the background

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:90%
from our childhood.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.146 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, everybody has
something where they're--

00:34:28.146 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:90%
they just want love.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that helps me
understand their heart.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:90%
They are energetic beings.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And looking more at the soul
instead of, well, this guy,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:84%
he's too superficial, or
he wants this or that.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to maybe get jaded.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But I just try to see them
as just a beautiful spark

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.052 align:middle line:84%
of the divine who wants to
find love and express love.

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had anybody come to you

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.030 align:middle line:90%
who was just totally despondent?

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.972 align:middle line:84%
(WHINY VOICE) I
can't find anybody.

00:34:54.972 --> 00:34:56.889 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, they'll
say their patterns.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm always
attracting the gold diggers

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
or the drama queens or the
high-maintenance women.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
And there's something there.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a client who
tends to do that.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And I say, why do
you always pick

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:84%
these women who just
drain you financially

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:90%
or they stand you up?

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
there's something.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is that-- it's
working for you.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And he thought about it.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.803 align:middle line:84%
He says, I think I
somehow like the drama.

00:35:20.803 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm attracted to that drama.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe he doesn't
have to make a commitment.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.083 align:middle line:90%
So he's working on it.

00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:90%
He's getting coaching.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
He's working on it, because
now he's a little older,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
in his 60s, and doesn't want
to just continue on that path.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it strange
for somebody to not

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
want to have a relationship
at all in their life?

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Mm.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody's different.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But society really
has that message,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that everybody should
be in love with all

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.075 align:middle line:84%
the messaging and the rom-coms
and the Disney and all that.

00:35:53.075 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You should have somebody.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But your path may be
just to be a teacher

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%
or go within or learn or heal.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know a guy who
just wants to have fun.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Just wants to date.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:90%
He just-- he likes his house.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:05.480 align:middle line:90%
He likes his cars.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Right.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
doesn't want to have

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to worry about a family
or anything like that.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Nothing
wrong with it.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't think so?

00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: I don't think so.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Every individual is--
we're all sovereign beings.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:90%
We can decide.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe in some
past lives, I really--

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I like the past life stuff too.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he had
relationships that--

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
somebody told me--
I was wondering

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
why I never had the urge to
have children in this lifetime.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:90%
It never crossed my mind.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit guide, he
says, because you've done it.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.273 align:middle line:84%
You've done it so many
times in past lives.

00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of kids,
a lot of family around.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.713 align:middle line:84%
This life was just about
you being with your husband

00:36:42.713 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:90%
and doing some other things.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, what causes
a relationship to fizzle out?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It starts great.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Sparks fly.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And then a month, two months,
a year, it ain't the same.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.198 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Because
that initial--

00:36:56.198 --> 00:36:58.615 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more magical
than that initial spark

00:36:58.615 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
when you meet
somebody and you've

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.530 align:middle line:84%
got those hormones flying
and that initial attraction,

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's so exciting.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But then in reality, that's
not going to sustain.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have that addiction,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:84%
kind of that high
off of that newness

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.903 align:middle line:84%
that really will not
continue, so you're going

00:37:14.903 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:90%
to move into something else.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.300 align:middle line:84%
You're going to move into a
deeper relationship or more

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
friendship.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:90%
So people want that newness.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.105 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
have affairs or break up

00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:27.322 align:middle line:90%
and go for that again.

00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say that you're almost

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:90%
like a psychologist?

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: [LAUGHS] Sometimes
I feel like it, you know?

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:90%
People need advice.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:90%
They need help.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:90%
They want to talk.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm now
moving into coaching as well.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm specializing in boundaries.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of coaching?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.125 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Nancy Levin,
who's a Hay House author,

00:37:45.125 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:90%
has a coaching program.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's specializing
in boundaries,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and I just did a whole year of
study and just got certified.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody needs
help with boundaries,

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:84%
with co-dependency, if
you're a people pleaser,

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
can't say no, always attracting
the wrong kind of person,

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:90%
so I can help with that now.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- I've known
these people through my life,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:84%
like a woman may be attracted
to a guy who can't get a job

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:90%
or stays unemployed.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Right.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, Nancy, my teacher,
she had the same--

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.830 align:middle line:90%
she had a story about herself.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.620 align:middle line:84%
She was an overachiever,
and she felt

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
her worth was being
a money maker,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:84%
being somebody who made a
lot of money and worked hard.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so she'd attract guys
who weren't really working.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.780 align:middle line:84%
That was like she's
showing her worth.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm going to take
care of everything.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
care of everybody.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a program that's
running from your childhood

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
where maybe you thought,
in order to be important

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.443 align:middle line:84%
or to be loved, I have
to take care of everybody

00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
or I have to do
everything for everyone,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
or I have to make
a lot of money.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: The
patterns play out.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
people's health, well-being,

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
taking care of themselves to
develop that relationship?

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.645 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: It's
important to people.

00:39:02.645 --> 00:39:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They always ask me, I want--

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have to take
care-- especially in the older

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:84%
group that I work
in they said, well,

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have to
take care of somebody.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.132 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be a nursemaid.

00:39:10.132 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't mind
dating an older guy

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.147 align:middle line:84%
if he's taking care of himself,
if he's fit, if he's active,

00:39:16.147 --> 00:39:16.980 align:middle line:90%
so that's important.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's one of the
next projects for Marla?

00:39:19.605 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: Well, stepping
into the coaching and getting

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:84%
my book, "The Magic
Seeker," out is really--

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have the passion
for writing, the matchmaking,

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.220 align:middle line:84%
coaching, the
healing, continuing

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:90%
giving people readings.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You love
helping people.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: I love
helping people.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people stir
up a conversation with you

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:84%
quickly when they
know what you do?

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yes.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.632 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I
wrote my first memoir,

00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:10%
"Diary of a Beverly Hills
Matchmaker," which came out

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.215 align:middle line:10%
in 2010, because
everywhere I go,

00:39:48.215 --> 00:39:50.548 align:middle line:10%
if I was at a party or something
and somebody would say,

00:39:50.548 --> 00:39:52.700 align:middle line:10%
what do you do, I said,
well, I'm a matchmaker.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And they'll-- oh!

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:90%
What's that like?

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:90%
What's your craziest story?

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, they wanted to know.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help me.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'll
write a memoir,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
a year in the life
of what it's like.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.462 align:middle line:84%
And they really get an
in-depth look at it.

00:40:06.462 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTENSON: My website,
marlamartensen.com.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.102 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell your name.

00:40:11.102 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTENSON: M-A-R-L-A
M-A-R-T-E-N-S-O-N.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.313 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a podcast called
"The Mystical Matchmaker."

00:40:18.313 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Say hi to your
husband Adolfo for me.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTENSON: Hi, Adolfo.

being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It was so much fun.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:28.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was great.

A matchmaker who does
all the work for you,

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.890 align:middle line:10%
and all you have to do
is sit back and have

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:10%
the benefits of meeting people.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
