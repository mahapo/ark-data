00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Doctors JJ and
Desiree Hurtak are

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
founders of the Academy
for Future Science.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an international
non-governmental organization

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that works to bring
cooperation between science

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
through the very

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:90%
positive use of consciousness.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
They've written a
number of books.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Their latest is called
"Giza's Industrial Complex."

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, JJ and
Desiree, to the program.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Thank you, George.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Always a pleasure.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You two may be the
most sought after couple

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I have ever come across.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious, how
did you two meet?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
JJ?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: I was a young
professor working with the Walt

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:10%
Disney Studios in a
college called California

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Institute of the Arts.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:10%
And Desiree was my
student, and she

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.722 align:middle line:10%
was able to keep up with me
in art, science, and music.

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
that's exactly when

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
he had his unique
experience that

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
brought about his famous
book, "The Keys of Enoch".

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:10%
And so at that point I
understood what he was saying,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:10%
and that brought us together.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's been 73.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And you have keyed in a lot
on a lot of different things.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But you specialize, would
you say, on Egyptology?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.315 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Egyptology
and also other sacred areas

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So we combine nine
different disciplines

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
from archaeology, sociology,
psychology, to space science.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it
like, JJ, to stand

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
by the base of the
pyramids and look up?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's overwhelming.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You see a gargantuan
system that is

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
far beyond human
comprehension at first.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why the
great Greek thinkers, Homer

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
went to Egypt, Pythagoras
the great mathematician, all

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of them had their
schooling in Egypt.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the great
center of information

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.793 align:middle line:84%
that we're still
trying to unravel.

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
fascinated with Egypt

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little boy.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
My late father
was born in Cairo.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
We're not Egyptian by any means.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:90%
We're Lebanese.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's where they
were when he was born,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and they stayed there
for about six years

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.993 align:middle line:84%
before they came to
the United States.

00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And
Desiree's father,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
as a young medical student
in Vienna, Austria,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
went down to Egypt
in 1923, stood

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.643 align:middle line:90%
at the head of the sphinx.

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:37.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:38.872 align:middle line:90%
That's where my dad was born.

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Even the paws
were still under the sand.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.587 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been involved as a
family for 100 years in Egypt.

00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of mystery.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
going on in Egypt, JJ?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I think what
we're seeing in Egypt,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
it's a model of information
on all levels of energy

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:90%
production.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
A library of ancient knowledge,
an astrophysical gauge

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
or computer of some
level, mathematical magic

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:90%
connecting us with the stars.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the realm
of science, psychology,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality is connected
in the roots of consciousness

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
with Egypt.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.157 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And you know, we

00:03:13.157 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
were actually one of the
founders of the Tomb of Osiris.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is 100
feet down, almost

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the plateau.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what brought us
to our latest book, "Giza's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Industrial Complex",
because if you

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
go that 100 feet down, you'll
find a type of sarcophagus

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
with four pillars around it, but
it's also covered with water.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So why would you ever put a dead
body down with a lot of water?

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So this gave us the idea
that maybe it was more

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
than something of burial.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a technology
that they understood

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and they needed the
boxes, like we use today

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.875 align:middle line:84%
with covering nuclear fuel,
to maintain that technology.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course digging
down 100 feet,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.002 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't the shifting sands
just keep filling back in?

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
these are called well shafts,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually
several on the plateau.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, people look
at the three pyramids,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
but in addition to that,
there's queen pyramids,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
well shafts, there's

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%
other sarcophagi around.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole mastaba area.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a huge
complex, and that's

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.017 align:middle line:84%
why we call it Giza's
industrial complex.

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
We're not just looking
at the Great Pyramid.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete area of
technology, we believe.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you believe the
pyramids are power sources,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Correct.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Power sources and
chronometers, which

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:90%
means time measuring devices.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are members of the
American Hydrogen Energy

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We've lectured with specialists
throughout the world.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And many of our colleagues
believe, as we do,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid represents
a mechanism through which

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen can be produced.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a machine?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.772 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, we also think

00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that there's aspects
of initiation,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
so we don't want
to throw that out.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We also acknowledge the
alignment to stars like Orion,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
or we'll say the area of Alpha
Draconis, the circumpolar area

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Thuben.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to that,
hydrogen probably was used.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, hydrogen is
a number one fuel

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%
throughout the whole universe.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do is
take water and break it down.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
High school students
can do this.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we're at the
verge of a new hydrogen economy.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're using a
lot of battery technology,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
like the Teslas,
but the next phase

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that Europe and other
countries are coming out with

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:90%
will be a hydrogen technology.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher
Dunn believes also

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that the Giza power
plant is exactly that.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:10%
What are the chambers
like inside the pyramids?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:10%
Because they have
these little long tubes

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:10%
of chambers and things.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:10%
What are they doing?

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:10%
Where are they going?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:10%
>>CHRIS DUNN: Well, that's
one of the unique features

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid, are
those what you call tubes.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:10%
Specifically, if you talk
about the Queen's Chamber

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:10%
in the Great Pyramid,
that has these tubes

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.910 align:middle line:10%
that are going up on an angle
but don't exit the pyramid.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:10%
That was one of the mysteries.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And there are two
of these shafts

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:10%
that go up on the north side and
the south side of the chamber.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long are they?

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I'd say
about 200 feet long.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.423 align:middle line:90%
By what, a couple feet?

00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: But they don't exit.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't exit.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
No, they're only about
eight inches square.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And then in the King's
Chamber, you have two shafts.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
One is about 8.4 inches
wide by 4.8 inches high,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and that shaft
goes to the north.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And then on the south side,
you have a large opening

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in the wall that looks
like a catcher's mitt,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:90%
like a horn antenna.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have carried
water or mercury or anything

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, if you--

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
any conduit can carry any
solution you put in it.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
was that the reason?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They have been, I think,
incorrectly labeled air shafts.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
that is, particularly

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
with the Queen's Chamber, they
wouldn't have carried any air

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
because they were closed.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:90%
So why did they exist?

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I address in my
book, "The Giza Power Plant",

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is what the purpose
of those shafts is.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And exactly
what do you think it was?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, if you take
the whole pyramid and all

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the features within the
pyramid, and I actually

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
created a scenario where
the Great Pyramid is

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
in harmony or resonating
with the Earth

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and drawing energy
through it, that energy

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is then transferred
into airborne sound.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The power center is
the King's Chamber,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's constructed
out of granite,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:90%
thousands of tons of granite.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the Queen's Chamber
was where they created hydrogen

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
with two solutions
coming in from the north

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:90%
side and the south side.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They mix, and they
create hydrogen.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And there's evidence
to support my theory.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.775 align:middle line:10%
I think we've talked in the
past about the Gantenbrink's

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:26.825 align:middle line:10%
Door, where they found those--

00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's the one
they drilled through?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Yes, exactly.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there's more
information on that, I think,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.660 align:middle line:90%
that was revealed in 2011.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you both feel
about Christopher's thoughts?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.846 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I think
Christopher is right on target.

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:10%
We were there in
the 1970s, and we

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:10%
collected samples of the salt
crystals inside the Queen's

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:10%
Chamber, what is called
calcium carbonate, calcium

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:10%
sulfur, sodium chloride,
salt. And we gave this

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:10%
to our late colleague
Patrick Flanagan.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Flanagan analyzed this
with specialists in Arizona,

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:10%
and they came up
with the conclusion

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:10%
this material could have been
produced by hydrogen activity.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Now we would alter

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
a little bit the structure
that he defined here.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:84%
We actually would put the water
coming in from underground,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:84%
because the Tomb of
Osiris is full of water.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the Giza Plateau,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
it sucks literally
water underneath.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:90%
It's just an amazing thing.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a hydropump.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the desert?

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
In the desert, no.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
There's water all
the way going up.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why even the
Tomb of Osiris fills up.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
far from the Nile.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course years
ago, when there

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
was the-- before the Aswan
Dam, now the water levels

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
were higher all over
the Nile canal area.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But basically, we believe water
came from underneath, came up.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it's so simple with
just a slight energy technology

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to separate that water
into hydrogen gas.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Now there's one new theory
that's also come out that ties

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:90%
in with our co-writer.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:10%
We have a co-writer on the
book named James Brown.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:10%
He's a contractor, and so he
knows a lot about building.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is the fact
of using maybe lasers.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Now I know lasers sound very
odd for people going back

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:90%
4,000, 5,000 years.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And people laugh at that.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: However.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
However, there's

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:90%
a new working theory for fusion.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a great technology.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not fission that
gives you all the pollution,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:90%
but this is fusion.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
hydrogen and boron.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Now boron was
available in Egypt.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And hydrogen is what
we're talking about.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
If you pulse it, you pulse that
energy, you will get fusion.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
You'll get a reactor going.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, and so
does our colleague,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.983 align:middle line:84%
the Grand Gallery was that
place for that reactor.

00:10:45.983 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Chemical laser.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Now we believe
hydrogen gas was made and used

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
all over most of the
temples of Egypt.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they use this for?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.397 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well, that's
always a very big question.

00:10:57.397 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So obviously not everyone
had an electric light bulb.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
They didn't drive cars like
we would do today, because we

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:90%
really shouldn't be using that.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
have their computers.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Right.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't need it, but
what they did use it for

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
was the priest and
the royal family.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: As
well as the artist.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.035 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And the artist.

00:11:13.035 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:10%
So what they can do, like
the Dendera light bulb,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:10%
you can use a gas to light.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And we know that-- when
Dr. Hurtak said the artist,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:10%
it's because if
you go underground,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:10%
you'll find a lot of the details
on these tombs and chambers.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't even use mirrors to
get the light down into them.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And there's no soot on the wall.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So how did they do
this beautiful art

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:84%
in the lower chambers if they
didn't have some sort of light?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.707 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Now, Erich von Daniken

00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:10%
has shown that you can
take that Dendera light

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:10%
bulb that you see
on the wall and make

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:10%
a light bulb like we have now.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.027 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We actually saw
this demonstrated in the year

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
2000 in Vienna, Austria,
where we had anthropologists

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and researchers from all
parts of the world looking

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
at the interesting
artifacts of Egypt,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
as Desiree has just
explained, from Dendera,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
where you see priest scientists
sitting under these two flasks.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Lighting were like
neon lights, suggesting

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians had
the ability to create

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
certain gases, light sources
that enabled them to put

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
together a vast labyrinthian
system of tunnels and canals

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:90%
under the complete Giza plateau.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is the great
complex of Giza

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
for energy production,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
for the training of scientists
throughout the ancient Middle

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
East, like Pythagoras
and others,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.830 align:middle line:84%
as well as leaving behind
time capsules of information

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that Russian scientists
believe connect us

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:90%
with distant galaxies.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
know this technology?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who taught it?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well, of course,
if we go by the Egyptian records

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
themselves, like the
German philologist

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Kurt Sethe wrote in terms of
the Egyptian cosmic heritage,

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the gods, the imperishable
gods from Orion or Emsah,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian word, from
the stargates of Orion

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
from the three stars
in the belt of Orion

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
somehow had the ability to
transmit this information

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
metaphysically to the
Mayan and the Egyptians,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
or a earlier society
of pre-scientists

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
were able to translate
this into physical form.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Desiree,
you think so too?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'd like to go on
a little bit about the hydrogen

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.075 align:middle line:84%
technology, what else
they could use it for.

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Plutarch,
a very famous historian,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:84%
wrote that in the Temple of
Jupiter Ammon, which is perhaps

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:36.370 align:middle line:84%
even on the border of Libya,
that they had a light that

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
would never go out.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They call it one of
the eternal lights,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that even with rain or
wind it would never go out.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And we believe
that's what you see

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
in what's called
Brown's gas, which

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is a slight alteration from
the hydrogen splitting.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: To the HHO.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: It's HHO.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So you can have this very
powerful acetylene torch

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that's really-- it's cold
almost to the touch around it,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's so powerful it can
cut through sheets of steel.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's one aspect.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Now also Eagle Research,
who talks often

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
about new technologies, mentions
that even hydrogen, this HHO

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
especially, you can
actually drink it,

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:90%
because it's negative ions.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
makes you healthy.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not-- we are
not into healing.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling everyone to
go out there and go do it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drink your hydrogen.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, no.

00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the HHO in particular,
which is Brown's gas,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:90%
has been known.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
hexagonal shape water,

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
like Jerry Pollack has
come out with if you've

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:90%
heard about the work he's done.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And basically people have
taken it in and said it's--

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
or even just put
it on their bodies.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:90%
It heals wounds.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not into healing,
telling people what to do,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:90%
but there's a lot of benefit.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Also agriculture.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Agriculture was known
for the Egyptians.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people came to Egypt
to get the agriculture.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And if this water,
even with hydrogen--

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
we use hydrogen
today in agriculture.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.823 align:middle line:84%
That's one of our
mainstays, hydrogen.

00:15:00.823 --> 00:15:01.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:90%
We use it in cars these days.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Toyota loves it.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.822 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:08.822 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that better technology,
JJ, than electric cars,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Definitely.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
We were in Japan in 2011
with Professor Omasa.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one who came
up with the breakthroughs

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:90%
for the hydrogen fuel cell.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
We also were with
Professor Winter

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
in Germany, who came up
also with the breakthrough

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
for hydrogen to be applied to
the truck fleets of Germany.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we're at an amazing
time in future science

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and engineering
where we're going

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to go more and more
into the hydrogen field,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.632 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the safety
situation has been established.

00:16:41.632 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Right, and Europe

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
is just about to make statements
on moving to a hydrogen

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:90%
economy.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have, actually, a
friend in Santa Barbara

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%
who has a Mirai.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's only a
few hydrogen fueling stations

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
right now, but
California is committed

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to putting in over 100.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's interesting
is there's a big cost in this.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you have to
transport hydrogen,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
then it actually
takes a lot of money,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
because you're driving this
gas, even if it's condensed,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to long distances.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But what they're starting
to do, including Shell Oil,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
is they're putting a little
generator right next to the gas

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.064 align:middle line:84%
So basically they're not
even having to bring it in.

00:17:22.064 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right there.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
They can actually

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:90%
generate it right there.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.375 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's taken
so long to get out there,

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:29.575 align:middle line:84%
because there's companies like
Millennium Reign Energy out

00:17:29.575 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
of Ohio that says, you know,
you can buy one of these things.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
You can put them
in your backyard.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the companies
don't want to do that.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
They want to have
you still grid-tied,

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, to the technology.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the aspects,
but we're very positive.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Right now batteries are more
competitive than hydrogen.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But if there were only
100 gas cars on the road,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
the price of gas would
be really high too.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's get thousands of
hydrogen cars out there.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the hydrogen
being generated.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Not blue energy,
but green energy.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Blue energy is where you use
fossil fuels to generate it;

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:90%
coal, natural gas.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.255 align:middle line:84%
But green hydrogen is
where you use water.

00:18:11.255 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we think--

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
the way to do it.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.615 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: --the
ancient Egyptians had done.

00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So we
have oil, gas, coal.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But now the idea of using
water as a vertical smokestack,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, eliminating
all the pollutants,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.552 align:middle line:84%
is something we believe goes
all the way back to Egypt.

00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:26.968 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And they've been

00:18:26.968 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
able to do-- this is
from Stanford University.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Professor Dai has shown
that you can use salt water.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.667 align:middle line:84%
See, we can take the oceans of
the planet and we can use it.

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The ocean is a battery.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: I know.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Egyptians
had salt water batteries.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other aspect
that we take beyond Chris Dunn.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.553 align:middle line:84%
We understand that the Egyptians
had other energy models.

00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: You know,
we're very pro solar and wind.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But one of the big problems
with solar and wind is storing.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't store the energy.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't have a
capacitor enough to store.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.943 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Exactly.

00:18:55.943 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously the
batteries, they've

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
tried that, the
lithium batteries.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the salt
water battery holder,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
which has been developed
by several companies,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:90%
is also another potential.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's incredible.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And even using some--
this goes back to Egypt,

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because that's kind of
what we're talking about.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
Quidnet Energy Company.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
the old oil shafts

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
to store the compressed
hydrogen or water in there

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.873 align:middle line:90%
to be able to store the energy.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So the Egyptians
had storage facilities

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And then our work with
ground penetrating radar

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:90%
is also remote sensing.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
With colleagues from
Stanford Research Institute

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.437 align:middle line:90%
we saw, as it were, a handshake.

00:19:37.437 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
They're looking from above
and looking from below.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
We were able to realize the
Egyptians had the ability

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:84%
to sequester hydrogen
at a very early period.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they have
this kind of knowledge?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Was it given to them
from extraterrestrials?

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well, we're part
of a cosmic mind, as it were.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.775 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
throughout the universe.

00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And as we know,
our human mind is

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
connected with every
mind on planet Earth.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We are global minds
interconnecting.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that this
doesn't stop with Mother Earth.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We are connected
with our genetic code

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.395 align:middle line:84%
with cosmic oscillations, what
we call cosmic intelligence.

00:20:10.395 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
But we do believe--

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're not talking about
how the pyramid was built.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:90%
That probably was--

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's another
show all by itself

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yes, another show.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But that probably
was ET technology.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So we believe, in
a sense, that they

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
came to give early civilization
a boost and this technology.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And it really was
from way before.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
We go back with Robert
Schoch to the idea

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx is much
older, probably even

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:90%
in a different environment even.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
some kind of storage area

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the Sphinx,
as Edgar Cayce had said,

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:90%
a Hall of Records.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
we were with the team

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.395 align:middle line:84%
that actually went down with
the ground penetrating radar.

00:20:47.395 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we were able
to discuss the fact that there

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be a
cavity that was there

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
as well as towards the
rear of the Sphinx.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, there are

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
two holes around the Sphinx.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.577 align:middle line:84%
One's on the side,
and one's literally

00:21:01.577 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the back.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Some people say about the head.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gone up that
high, and I haven't

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
seen any pictures of that.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot--

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
these cavities could
have been dug out

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
by we'll say, the
1800s explorers

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, bottom line is it's
much more than just a pyramid.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:10%
And Asclepius, which is an
ancient Nag Hammadi text--

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: The
Coptic text tells us--

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:10%
and this is Hermes Trismegistus,
which is an Egyptian deity

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:10%
figure, or we would
call a cosmic scientist,

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:10%
talking to Asclepius.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Each of the most pious
country in the world

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
has become the most impious.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
A land that was once full of
temples is now full of tombs.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
A land once filled with gods has
become a landfill with corpses.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was there in the
Asclepius Nag Hammadi text

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
found in the 1945-47 area of
recent archaeological discovery

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that speaks of the gods
that were there in Egypt.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now this technology,
this hydrogen technology,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
had to be used for
more than just light.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:90%
There's something else they had.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: No, exactly.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So agriculture, I have to say,
we use a lot of hydrogen today.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
not green hydrogen

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
but, it's used and
mixed with nitrogen

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.557 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of our agriculture
all over the world.

00:22:18.557 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's what, fertilizers?

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.807 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes.

00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's necessary.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So they used it, I
believe, for agriculture,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
which was a necessary
commodity at the time

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
to get the civilization
up and running and going.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about also
the health benefits of HHO,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.353 align:middle line:90%
which is Brown's gas.

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And also
through the Phoenicians.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The Phoenicians were the
great masters of navigation

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
for the Egyptian empire.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the
modern day Syrians?

00:22:42.747 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The modern
day Lebanese people.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lebanese and Syrians.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And they had
brought out information

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
through even the new world.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
We have found Phoenician cargo
buried off the coast of Brazil

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:90%
in the Atlantic.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We found evidences,
also, of Phoenician areas

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
up the delta of the
Mississippi, something recently

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
understood privately
by some archaeologists

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.957 align:middle line:84%
who have found the gold ingots
that were used later in Egypt.

00:23:09.957 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
JJ, a lot of people think that
the Great Pyramid is a result

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.522 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis, a tie-in there.

00:23:16.522 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes, I feel that
there is a higher connection

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:90%
with an earlier civilization.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Some called it Atlantis,
others call it Altea.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We believe that there is
a definite relationship

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
between Egypt as a
central focal point

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.125 align:middle line:84%
to 12 other civilizations,
Atlantis being one.

00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a chance to
interview film director Carmen

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Boulter about her recent
Atlantis discoveries.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CARMEN BOULTER: And what
we're finding all over

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:10%
is beings that are
giant, and the bones,

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:10%
and distended skulls, all over,
Bolivia, all over, all over.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nephilim?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and I think
that can be a catch-all,

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:90%
because, you know, who did it?

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
The Anunnaki.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, Anunnaki Nephilim.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Aliens.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, that doesn't go in depth.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We could just sit here and
go, the Anunnaki did it.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't explain much.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa, who's that?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: OK, so this
is Gia, the giant.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:10%
And so we started
with photographs

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:10%
of a distended skull of an 8
foot 6 inch being from Bolivia.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:10%
And Marcia Moore
has recreated it

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:10%
by using a 3D program
called Mudbox,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:10%
and she's putting together
what this being may

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:10%
have looked like.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:10%
And I've called her Gia.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, she looks human.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And she's
got the distended skull,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and she's a giant.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.902 align:middle line:10%
So she's just working on her
eyes now to make her real,

00:24:37.902 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:10%
but we're recreating a real
3D model that will move

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.860 align:middle line:10%
and speculating about what
this being could have been.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Almost nine feet tall?

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yeah,
and there's some

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:90%
that are even taller than that.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:10%
But this becomes part
of the storyline of--

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:10%
and that would have been normal
in Atlantean times, perhaps,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.530 align:middle line:10%
before the disaster that
made that exceptionally rare.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Elongated skull.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Is she human or
extraterrestrial?

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well,
that's always going

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:10%
to be an issue,
like I keep saying,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:10%
aliens, aliens,
you know, Anunnaki.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.803 align:middle line:90%
I mean, aren't we all star seed?

00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we are.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Where did it start?

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think we get this misnomer
that we're all running around

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
in our vehicles,
scooters, whatever,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.217 align:middle line:84%
and we think that
extraterrestrials

00:25:24.217 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
have to have a ship.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the beings
can be channeling through us,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't necessarily
need to be in ships.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:10%
So the extraterrestrials
is something-- again,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:10%
I think that these terms
and the way they're used

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:10%
have been confusing us more
than giving us information.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, though,
she had an elongated skull--

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes, and--

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --based on
what I could see.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.285 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And
what that would do

00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:48.157 align:middle line:84%
is give more room
for the pineal gland.

00:25:48.157 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland
is the connection

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
to spirit and all the psychic
nature and that sort of thing.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when we don't really
understand the abilities

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that they had to create the
technology, to bilocate,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
teleport, all that
sort of thing.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not used to
that, because we're

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
in a dumbed-down state
with a smaller pineal gland

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that's even getting
less useful to us

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
because something like
fluoride can calcify it.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's onto
something, isn't she?

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes, she is.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:10%
Our mutual friend in
Austria, Klaus Dona,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:10%
has collected samples of
these elongated skulls

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:10%
from all over the world.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:10%
We've had the
opportunity to work

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:10%
with Jaime Gutierrez, a famous
architect anthropologist

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:10%
in the country of Colombia.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And he has actually
shown us physical samples

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:90%
of elongated skulls.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So we know that this phenomena
is a taste of a much earlier

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:90%
area of anthropology.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes,
and the Egyptians clearly

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
had on their wall
painting, so to speak,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:90%
these elongated skulls.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.397 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So they actually

00:26:50.397 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
definitely communicated
with them that there were

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
shared intelligences with us.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And we do believe that they
came from an extraterrestrial

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We agree with her, though,
somewhat that we also

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
think we're
extraterrestrial, and we just

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:84%
can't remember
where we came from.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.218 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we've
been seeded, probably.

00:27:07.218 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, and so
we've been here for a while,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we don't
remember our origins.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But bottom line, we also
don't have to always come

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
in a physical spaceship.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I like how she said that.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
We can actually just
materialize and dematerialize.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I think this is what
sometimes alien beings do

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.007 align:middle line:90%
from time to time as well.

00:27:24.007 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: This suggests
a whole new paraphysics

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.055 align:middle line:90%
of hyperdimensional experience.

00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we're saying is we
need a new textbook of biology

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and understanding of evolution.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We would call it the
higher evolution,

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're one subset
of others who have

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.172 align:middle line:90%
mastered time-space navigation.

00:27:39.172 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So
"The Keys of Enoch",

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
which is Dr. Hurtak's
main book, talks

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
about the fact of how the
pyramids align to Orion.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And why is Orion important?

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, we believe it was the
place for higher intelligence.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to also the
original "Book of Enoch",

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
which is an ancient
Ethiopic book,

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the giants
who are many ells--

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:90%
they call it E-L-L-S, ells--

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:90%
high.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.428 align:middle line:84%
They were actually even
higher than eight feet.

00:28:05.428 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They were probably like
some of the statues

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.308 align:middle line:84%
that you find in Egypt,
literally 20 feet and more.

00:28:10.308 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course, absolutely.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: 12 to 14 feet high.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Nephilim
were giants, weren't they?

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.855 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Exactly.

00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
read the biblical--

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.435 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The Nephilim
that were expelled,

00:28:20.435 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
we would call them the
fallen programmers.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go beyond
the nuances of ET or angel.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a whole
new cosmic vocabulary,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:84%
realizing that there
are Egyptian type levels

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
of civilization in space.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is very
clear in my research

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with remote viewing
and the realization

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
there were pyramids on Mars.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
As you may or may not know
I was the first to release

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the actual pictures of the
Mariner 9 probes on Mars where

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.782 align:middle line:90%
you see these gigantic--

00:28:48.782 --> 00:28:49.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were the guy.

00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:50.907 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:50.907 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.573 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So putting
two and two together

00:28:53.573 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
with the myths of Far
East, Africa, the Americas,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
we realize that in the
ancestry of the human race

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a recognition that the
pyramid is the basic building

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:90%
block of evolution.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not localized
on planet Earth.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It extends into space.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Just like human
intelligence, it's

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%
not localized on Mother Earth.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.738 align:middle line:84%
It extends into space,
Mother Universe.

00:29:12.738 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard that
the pyramids could have

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.677 align:middle line:90%
been earthquake stabilizers.

00:29:16.677 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.135 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
this is one argument

00:29:19.135 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that's been brought forth in
the areas of massive earthquakes

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:84%
like we had in the area of
Cairo in the 12th century.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids were the most
stable structures to survive.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
also interesting

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that most of the
historic records

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are put in the base of
pyramids throughout the world.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They represent, as it were, the
time capsules of information.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
keep a thing safe,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:90%
put it inside of the pyramid.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
But you know, Djoser,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
the older pyramids

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that just got opened in
Saqqara, if you look inside,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.108 align:middle line:84%
You know, you think
if it's just a burial

00:29:51.108 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
tomb then it would just
have a couple channels

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some places for their
families to die and be buried.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there's
chimney stacks.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:84%
There's some unusual
structures in there.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chimney stacks?

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah,
a bunch of chimney

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:84%
stacks, one central
stack as well.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to what you
would use in this technology.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to
Asclepius, you know,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
it was a place of the
gods, not a place of tombs.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.388 align:middle line:84%
There was never anybody found in
any of the three main pyramids.

00:30:18.388 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a portal?

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of travel device
where you could get into it

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.552 align:middle line:84%
and zoom off to
some other planet?

00:30:25.552 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well I don't want
to make science fiction seem

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:84%
like it's the 21st
century reality,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:84%
but we've outstripped
science fiction

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of realizing
the Egyptians had

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
mathematical relationships,
star or astrophysical

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
relationships, far beyond
our level of comprehension.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You both have
done great research.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Gaia's "Ancient
Civilizations" worked

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.320 align:middle line:84%
on uncovering some new
understandings of the pyramids

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at how
it ties into mathematics.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's track East from Giza.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:10%
Let's go off to Cambodia,
to Angkor in Cambodia.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:90%
An amazing sight.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, very much related
to the investigation

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery of death.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The very word
Angkor actually has

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
a meaning in the ancient
Egyptian language.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It means life to the Horus.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it
turns out that Angkor,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:84%
with its pyramidal
monuments, Angkor

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:84%
lies exactly 72 degrees
of longitude east of Giza.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.138 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that that is
an accident or a coincidence.

00:31:28.138 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a deep and
ancient connection, and what

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at in Angkor
because that site was

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
continuously used by many
later cultures both Hindu

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and Buddhist, what we're
looking at in Angkor

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
is the latest incarnation of a
much more ancient site, which

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
just like Giza, goes back
into remote prehistory.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these precise
calculations be spread across

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the globe and
communicating a code?

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible this is what
Nikola Tesla tapped into?

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.305 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval predicts this
is the language of the future.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT BAUVAL:
Well, the way we

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:84%
read the universe is
through mathematics

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and through its geometry.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And through its mathematics
and geometry we need to know.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Slowly through our
evolution we begin

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to work out how triangles
work, circles and ellipses,

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
various shapes, and now
work out the numbers, how

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:90%
they produce numbers.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So having said
this, the language

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that we, as human beings, would
be communicating sounds a bit--

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:84%
it sounds a bit too
science fiction.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we'll be
talking in English or Chinese

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.570 align:middle line:90%
in the next two centuries.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Already we're using a different
language using computers.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll be
talking mathematics

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that to
get a pure idea out,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to get a pure thought out and
to structure it so that you

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
understand exactly
what I'm talking about,

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
the shape, the size
that I mentioned,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.830 align:middle line:90%
the weight, the speed.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to number it.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to put mathematics.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is
speaking this language.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It's transmitting that language.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a silent language, if you
like, that needs to be read.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't need Egyptologists.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't need experts
in hieroglyphs.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have hieroglyphs.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:90%
We need mathematicians.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We need mathematicians
to read it.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the goals, is
to tell them to get into this.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
We've moved in a direction where
we rely on external knowledge.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
We seem to think that
the answer is out there

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and we look for it when the
answer may be inside us.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I truly believe this.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we need to
rechange how we see ourselves

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:90%
and how we educate ourselves.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I think what's interesting
now is that the science is

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:84%
beginning to sort of touch
the frontiers of what

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:84%
you would call in general
terms spirituality.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We internalize that
the universe is mental.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
It is a mental universe.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And we need to think in
different forms, not just

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
purely classical science.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:90%

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:10.413 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: --friends of
ours, Hancock and Bauval,

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and the Keys of Enoch actually
give a map of the world

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.179 align:middle line:84%
where there were 12
extraterrestrial cultures that

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:84%
contacted us
thousands of years ago

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
and gave us a language
of proto-communication,

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.830 align:middle line:84%
which is mathematics
plus acoustical physics

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
or vibrations.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
George, what is interesting
is we have discovered

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.449 align:middle line:84%
that acoustical physics plays
a very important role in how

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
Egyptian stones were moved,

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:84%
put in place, mathematically
and musically.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we were doing
research in the 1990s,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I was able to intone certain
ancient Egyptian Hebrew Aramaic

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.790 align:middle line:90%
mantras.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
the Grand Gallery,

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:84%
the largest area
inside the pyramid,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:90%
lit up in golden lights.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.577 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just instant light.

00:34:55.577 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Instant light
after standing columnar waves

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:90%
were generated.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this showed us that there
was a biofeedback system built

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
into the sound vibrations
of the Grand Gallery

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:90%
and even in the King's Chamber.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Certain mantras produce
certain vibratory levels,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
raising consciousness and
producing paraphysical events.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:35:13.823 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We've been working
with the top musicologists

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in the world, who have worked
with Steven Spielberg, who

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.090 align:middle line:84%
have worked with the Academy
of Arts and Sciences.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And they now recognize
that the Egyptians also

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:84%
were in tune with a
higher astrophysical

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:28.958 align:middle line:90%
language of vibrations.

00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They understood
frequency and resonance.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.083 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
we actually recorded sound

00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having
just overtones, which

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:84%
are a popular term, it
actually produced undertones,

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.130 align:middle line:84%
which brought your mind into
actually an alpha frequency

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So you got into more of
a state of meditation.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I, and other
friends at other times,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
have seen, literally,
the walls drop away.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like you're
out in outer space.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's all the
mathematics that Bauval

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:84%
was talking about that's
coded into the pyramid,

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
in addition to
the pi and the phi

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.620 align:middle line:90%
geometry that's also encoded.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the entire plateau
has a type of golden ratio

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it in terms
of all three pyramids.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
sacred geometry.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we take it to
some of the other grid

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
points on the planet, which
"The Keys of Enoch" talk about,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:84%
you go to areas
like Chichen Itza.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Strange enough, we're talking
about water going underneath.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the main
pyramid of Chichen Itza,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.532 align:middle line:90%
you will find water.

00:36:28.532 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Even
pyramids underwater off

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.563 align:middle line:90%
the coast of Taiwan and Japan.

00:36:31.563 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the water must have
something to do with it, right?

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Exactly.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:35.953 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Exactly.

00:36:35.953 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, we think not only
for the technology,

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
but also for the energy
and also for initiation.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
throw out the point.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It's really a triple
use technology.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.010 align:middle line:10%
You can get initiated
because the water is also

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:10%
coded within your body.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.702 align:middle line:10%
You're about 70% water.

00:36:49.702 --> 00:36:50.535 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:51.335 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating.

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: The pyramid, in
terms of its inner structure

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:10%
and chambers relate, we
believe, to the different energy

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:10%
circulatory systems
of the human body.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:84%
The blood circulatory
system, the lymphatic.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The heartbeat, for
example, is monitored

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
inside the echo patterns of the
king's coffer inside the King's

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Chamber.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We would be able to do the
music test in the 1990s,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and we realized that the beats
of the human heartbeat, 68

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:90%
to 72 beats--

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Matches.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: --is also matched
by patterns inside the coffer

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:84%
when a person is beginning
to breathe and chant

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:90%
in a certain frequency.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, the
heartbeat of the human race

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:84%
is in the grand coffer,
which is reddish,

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:84%
showing that we are
in the reddish portion

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of micro mathematics
and macro mathematics,

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid is a blueprint
of the human body in stone.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It is the temple
of the ancients.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the blueprint
of the future.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It is the cosmic
synthesis of all

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of the basic functions of life.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Desiree, how do
people track your works?

00:37:53.965 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:

being the beacon of light.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:84%
The missing capstone is
all of us working together,

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.817 align:middle line:84%
is the consciousness raising
the human race into the stars.

00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic minds to be sure.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:10%
The Great Pyramids
of Giza, probably one

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:10%
of the greatest
