>>We have breaking news on the
search for an American cargo

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:10%
ship that disappeared
during Hurricane Joaquin.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:10%
About an hour ago,
the ship's owner

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
told family members the nearly
800-foot "El Faro" sank.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:10%
A CBS News crew was aboard
a search plane on Sunday

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:10%
when a debris field was located.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:10%
This morning,
searchers found a body.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:10%
The ship was sailing
from Jacksonville

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:10%
to San Juan through
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
33 crew members were on
board, including 28 Americans.

>>GEORGE NOORY: And
as the announcer

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:10%
just mentioned, tragically
that ship was going

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:10%
through the Bermuda Triangle.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:10%
And on "Beyond Belief," you will
find out more about that area.

>>For centuries, the
500,000-mile area known

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
as the Bermuda Triangle has
captivated the imagination.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Many people have tried to
solve the puzzle over why

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
ships and planes seem to lose
their way in the Triangle.

David Pares, an Omaha-based
science instructor

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and former Air
Force meteorologist,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:90%
has a theory of his own.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
He thinks the intense energy
and thunderstorms form naturally

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
occurring space warp fields.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
David unravels this fascinating
weather phenomenon today

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, this
is an amazing area

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that I have been fascinated
with since I was a youngster,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
and you have too.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID PARES: Ever
since high school,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:10%
reading "The Mysteries
of The Bermuda Triangle,"

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:10%
particularly focusing
on Flight 19.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:10%
That caught my fancy.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
It's a sad occurrence to have
lost five aircraft like that

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:10%
with all their crew.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
that kept eating at me.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
What could I figure out?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
How could I prevent something
from happening in the future,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
alerting pilots and possibly
cargo ships, marine activity?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered what was really
behind all the disappearances.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.107 align:middle line:84%
So, over the years-- and I
would say since high school--

00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I've dabbled in it now and then.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But for the last 14
years, I've really

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of time looking into
the mysteries of the Bermuda

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Triangle.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And I guess one of the
things about the Triangle

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a lot of
environmental things going on

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I've sailed out there before,
been on a ocean liner.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I have flown on
aircraft as well,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and have never had an
encounter of anything of--

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.981 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Instrumentation
hasn't gone wacky or anything

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.225 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: No, no.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But that area off of Miami,
the 20 degrees north latitude,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
is very eruptive with
weather conditions.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I was able to
do is I went back in time

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:90%
through weather forensics.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I got a bunch of
charts and data.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I studied 26 aircraft
losses out of 56.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I picked them at random.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I analyzed
each missing occurrence.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was a
pattern began to emerge

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
after analyzing the weather.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And what was going on
is that these aircraft

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:84%
would go missing in between
a high and low pressure

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
system-- in a zone
of transition,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:90%
as they refer to it.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the circulation goes

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
from the low, back into the
high, and up and around.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So, that generates theory
of the week upper-air winds,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%
light variable winds.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And in this context, I found
out that in about 7 o'clock

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
in the morning-- and this would
start in the Key West area,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
That begins to show the
identification of generation

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of thunderstorms
for the afternoon.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
That light variable winds under
10 knots, dew point depressions

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
between the ambient air and
the dew point of 6 degrees.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you had
those factors and wind

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
flow out of the
east and northeast,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
you would get towering cumulus
develop into the Key West area.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So, cumulus, towering
cumulus, that indicating

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:90%
that there was unstable air.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:10%
And by 3 o'clock
in the afternoon,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:10%
as we migrate up latitude-wise
from Key West up into off

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:10%
of Miami, you get
these tremendously huge

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:10%
thunderstorms.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.397 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That just appear?

00:04:55.397 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Well, it takes a
little bit of time to develop.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:10%
But they'll rapidly build
within about 45 minutes.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they
sustain themselves,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
because the ocean
temperature at that point

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
is always pretty warm.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's a natural place
of energy for the storms

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to feed themselves.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And so, sustainable updrafts.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But these thunderstorms,
because the equatorial regions

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
have atmospheres up to between
80,000 to 100,000 feet--

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
depends on the season of
the year and what not.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
But these thunderstorms
will go up

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
to 65-- I've measured them
on radar when I was a radar

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
operator in MacDill
Air Force Base years

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:90%
ago up to 85,000 feet.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, if we go
up into the mid latitudes,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
55,000-foot thunderstorms,
severe weather,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
particularly like in 41 degrees
north latitude, like in Omaha,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
That's when you want to
batten down the hatches

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and seek some shelter because
of the severe weather activity.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, but when these
planes are flying through this,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
these planes have disappeared--
take us on a mock flight.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
What's happening to us
if we're in one of these?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, what these
storms-- and let's go even

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
above that, because in
recent encounters that I've

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
been down doing measurements,
we've had storm activity up

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:90%
to 78,000 feet.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.897 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
tremendously huge.

00:06:33.897 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
The girth of the thunderstorms
there in comparison

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to the land, land,
about 5 miles of girth

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
when you're out-- and that's
the width of the storm.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
When you're out into
the oceanic areas,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
as I define these
thunderstorm activity,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at about 25 miles.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the effects of these
storms are tremendous.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they have
potential energy

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:10%
that generates up to 10 to
the 15th watts of power.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:10%
The US generates 10 to
the 12th every year.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Just one thunderstorm.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One storm.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Now, these things
emanate electrical energy

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:10%
like crazy.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:10%
They ionize the air.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And that effect can go out to
25 to 30 miles beyond the storm.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And this air is all ionized, and
so these are charged particles.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when the aircraft
come into these vicinities,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're mostly all
made of metal, correct?

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Even carbon will
attract electricity.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that
as some of these aircraft

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
get too close to
these thunderstorms,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the ionized air will
gravitate to the aircraft.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And it generates a donut
around the aircraft.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The pilot can see up
and he can see down,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but he can't see out on
either side of the aircraft.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've had numerous cases
of aircraft reporting this.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually the
ionization bleeds away.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the pilot
can see again.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if it doesn't,
they're in trouble.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.463 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: They're in real
trouble, because at that point,

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the instruments are going--
their compasses are spinning.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, they're
going down when

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:90%
they think they're going up?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.793 align:middle line:90%
Or what's happening?

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: This is a process
of pilot disorientation.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Most pilots don't look
at their instruments

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
when that-- most of the pilots
that get involved in this

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
are VFR pilots,
Visual Flight Rules.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not really
trained in the IFR,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.367 align:middle line:90%
utilizing your instruments.

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if your
instruments are out of whack,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to
help you anyway, right?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, when most of the
instruments go out of whack,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the pilot then begins to think
that everything is wrong.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But in these conditions,
it can change

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:90%
the atmospheric pressure.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And if they're using
their inner ear

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
as flying by the
seat of the pants--

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
this is a common
terminology-- your ears

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:90%
aren't perfectly balanced.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So what you'll end up doing
is you do the death spiral.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And the stick will
go over just a tad,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because you think
you're flying level

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and your instruments are all--

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going right down.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: And you end up doing
a circular spiral like this.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:10%
And you end up
hitting the ocean.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you're gone.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: And you're gone.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's it.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.903 align:middle line:84%
And then once you hit the
ocean, and if you're right off

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
the coast of Miami, for example,
along the east coast there,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.664 align:middle line:90%
you've got the Gulf Stream.

00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, the
plane flies, right?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's stalled
out or anything like that?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:10%
There can be
possibilities Now, the FAA

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:10%
has listed in charts on their
websites of potential energy

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:10%
that can shut an engine down
if it isn't shielded properly.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:10%
This also can interfere with
large storm activity like this

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:10%
with the electrification.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It can interfere with the
navigation, the compass,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:90%
the radios, radar, all of that.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets strong
enough, and if you're

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
at a particular level where
this is really intense,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
then it can shut
your motor down.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the geographical
region of the Bermuda Triangle

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.937 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a quick look at that.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Legend has it that
the triangle covers

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the seas between Miami,
the island of Bermuda,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and Puerto Rico, an area of 1
and 1/2 million square miles.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Since 1492, when Columbus
first sailed into the area

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and saw strange
lights in the sky,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
the list of unexplainable
disappearances in the Bermuda

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Triangle has grown.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of ships
and planes have simply

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.571 align:middle line:84%
vanished-- no warning, no
distress calls, no wreckage.

00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it that region?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, you know,
there's a lot of lore

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:90%
about this, the folklore.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this can
occur anywhere in the world

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
if the conditions are right.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have the Dragon
Triangle up near Japan.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:90%
You have the Bermuda Triangle.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.225 align:middle line:84%
I actually have
cases that are out

00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of England of where
aircraft disappeared

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
in the same type
of circumstances.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a larger focus about
the mystery within this region.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, if you
actually analyze

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the records of
insurance companies,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
like Lloyd's of
London, they will

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
tell you is that
that vicinity is

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
no different than anywhere else
in the world as far as hazards.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
little misgiving here

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
of what the real function
of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a vast, open area.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And so anything that is being
transited across on the ocean

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:10%
or in the air is going to be
subjected to large weather

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:10%
encounters, ocean type of
currences-- for example,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:10%
rogue waves, which were totally
dismissed up until recently,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:10%
when an oil tanker coming back
out of Miami had a wave crash

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:10%
over its--

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huge waves too.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Huge wave.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:10%
100-foot wave.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:10%
So, we know that
these things do exist.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:10%
And this probably accounts
for a lot of ships

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:10%
and small pleasure craft
and that disappearing.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:10%
These things pop
up out of nowhere.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, David, as the
ship is on the ocean's surface,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
bubbles from underneath
can literally suck it down.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.595 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: It can.

00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It changes the
density of the water.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So, salt water has
a certain density.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And ships will
obviously float on it.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:10%
But if you change the
density, lessen the density

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:10%
of the water, and
if a methane pocket

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:10%
happens to burst
underneath the ocean floor,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:10%
then that comes up.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:10%
And then that will change
the density of the water.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a huge
gas bubble, right?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.483 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: And a gas bubble.

00:13:01.483 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are tens of millions
of little tiny bubbles

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:90%
that go--

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're all
underneath the ship, right?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Right.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.594 align:middle line:90%
It's like CO2 in soda, right?

00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
You see all the
bubbles coming up.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's even more
intense, obviously.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.104 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No buoyancy.

00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: And it reduces the
buoyancy, and the ship sinks.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:10%
They're designed to
utilize the buoyancy

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:10%
of the ocean in fresh water.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:10%
But when you induce do something
that lessens the buoyancy,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.865 align:middle line:10%
then the ship will--

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:31.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you power
your way out of it?

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.895 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: It depends on
how big the area is.

00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:90%
But yes, and then no.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on the size of
the area that's been influenced

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:90%
by the methane bubbles.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
really nothing unusual

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
or supernatural about
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
scientific, isn't it?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: You know, I leave open
a small area for Unidentified

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Flying Objects, UFOs--

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Capturing
them and taking them.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: --as potential
crashing into aircraft.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
There have been several cases
of reported communications

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
from aircraft to ground control
of UFOs encountering aircraft.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Some fly by.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.186 align:middle line:90%
They buzz the aircraft.

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There have been
a couple of cases

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.495 align:middle line:84%
where the UFOs actually
collided with an aircraft.

00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: But they never found
any of the result-- they never

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:90%
found any of the debris.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And see, the other
problem in that area--

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and like I said, if you're
near the east coast,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:90%
you've got the Gulf Stream.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:90%
That has a huge influence.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And so they will carry debris.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
If you go down
here at this point,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:84%
you could be several hundred
miles before they ever

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:90%
find the debris from the ship.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And during World
War II, for example

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.855 align:middle line:84%
there was an oil tanker that was
torpedoed by the Germans just

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
about south of Miami, actually.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And they actually found
that 70 years later.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But it was close
to 200 miles north

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:90%
of where the ship went down.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
it be that far off?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: The Gulf Stream.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just took it away.

00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: 4 knots.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:17.952 align:middle line:90%
3 to 4 knots.

00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all it takes.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: And as the ship sank,
it just started to glide,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.715 align:middle line:90%
and it never did reach it.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You're talking almost 300
feet between the surface

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And it depends if you're onto
the continental shelf or not.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:84%
If you go over the
continental shelf,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
now you've got about 7 miles of
potential that you can go down.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And so like you're
indicating, is

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of
scientific explanation for why

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:90%
things happen out there.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Most of it's weather.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's environmental.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Rogue waves.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:84%
These huge thunderstorm
activity with

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
tremendous electrical energy.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've even
had cases of pilots

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
flying into the
thunderstorms and then

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
being ejected 100 miles
outside of the thunderstorm.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
discovery made as result

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
of Bruce Gernon's flight in
1970, which was almost 25 years

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.469 align:middle line:90%
to the date of Flight 19.

00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some video of him.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.093 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:16:20.093 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible story.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: It is.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.753 align:middle line:10%
>>BRUCE GERNON: The deeper we
got, I noticed these flashes.

00:16:28.753 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was some
form of lightning,

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.305 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't lightning bolts.

00:16:33.305 --> 00:16:34.922 align:middle line:90%
Just these flashes.

00:16:34.922 --> 00:16:38.018 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't
any precipitation.

00:16:38.018 --> 00:16:42.615 align:middle line:84%
The visibility appeared
to be fairly good.

00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:45.626 align:middle line:84%
But the deeper I went,
the darker it got.

00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen
anything like that before.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:90%
So we deviated to the south.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We had been flying for
exactly 26 minutes now.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that I realized
that this storm was connected.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was one big
circular shape.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were caught
in the middle of it.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He lucked out.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: He certainly did.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
He was one lucky pilot.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
His encounter was he had
a circle of thunderstorms

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:90%
around him near Bimini Island.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He was coming from Andros
to West Palm Beach.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you can't
fly around this, can you?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Oh, no.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.196 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're stuck in it.

00:17:25.196 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Oceanic storms really
don't have much of a base.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
They go right near
to the surface.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.549 align:middle line:84%
So, if you flew under there,
you would have down gusts.

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That'll
take you right down.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: You'd have updrafts.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And it would push it
right into the water.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not of an
advisable thing to.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Do and he couldn't fly over
it, because he was indicating

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that these storms had erupted
to heights of over 65,000 feet,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
which, based on my research and
studies, all that is verified.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And the warm-water pools
that are out there,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
thunderstorms form up around.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Quite unique situations.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But he spotted the last two
thunderstorms coming up out

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:90%
of the-- being developed.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed there
was a tunnel, a hole.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.144 align:middle line:84%
The pilots refer to
these as sucker holes.

00:18:16.144 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And what was
interesting about it,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
he saw a blue sky
on the other side.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, they think
they can fly through it?

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Exactly.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're very turbulent.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And they can cause
damage to the aircraft.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And then just you're
dumped into the ocean.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they ever
rip a wing off a plane?

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.513 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: They have in the past.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
advise pilots not to--

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't fly
through this stuff.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.678 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Don't fly
through a sucker hole.

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But he felt he didn't
have any alternative.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
He was surrounded
by thunderstorms.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.374 align:middle line:84%
He was on the return side
of his 80 gallons of fuel.

00:18:49.374 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So, when you're flying
to Andros Island,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:90%
there isn't a refueling station.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So, he was flying back on
the reserves that he had.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:84%
He enters the hole
about 10,000 feet.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, as he exits the hole--
and the girth of this cloud

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:90%
was about 25, 35 miles.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:10%
It was wide, very wide.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And as he flew through the hole,
it only took him a few seconds.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And this made it very different
than-- there was something

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:90%
very unusual going on here.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
He felt a hydroplaning
aircraft and he

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
felt a slight weightlessness
inside the cockpit

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:90%
of the aircraft.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
He had his father and a business
associate in the aircraft.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And as they exited
the hole, the plane

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
got surrounded in an
ionized condition.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:90%
He calls it electronic fog.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't see
outside the windshield.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it have
that green mist to it?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: His was kind of a
grayish white combination.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Other pilots, like
Charles Lindbergh,

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
had a greenish--
green-colored ionized mist

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
around his aircraft,
and Martin Caidin.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>NOORY: I see
that a lot, David,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest when
a tornado's coming.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
The sky turns misty green.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: The aquamarine.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
real indications

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
of severe weather approaching
with extremely unstable air,

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:90%
with water vapor and everything.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that as the
sunlight comes through,

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
it gives you that
aquamarine appearance.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But very, very, very turbulent,
and not unlike what's

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
happening through the warp
tunnels-- or the sucker holes,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:90%
as pilots would refer to it.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And as he exited, was
surrounded by the ionized air.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And he made a call on the
radio, but the instruments

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
were all offline.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for him,
his radio still worked.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:90%
The propeller was still going.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
He makes a call to
air traffic control.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:90%
He says, where am I?

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm lost.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He had no idea.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Well, he knew he
was near Bimini Island,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:10%
but he couldn't find
his way at this point.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:10%
And so the approach
control told him

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:10%
that there is no aircraft on
their radar at Bimini Island.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And they start yelling
into the microphone

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:90%
that we are at Bimini Island.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
not here, right?

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.101 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: And the guy comes back
and he goes, you're not here.

00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:21.124 align:middle line:84%
He says, I have an
aircraft over Miami Beach.

00:21:21.124 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:90%
And they're perplexed.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:90%
The ionized air dissipates.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're right
over Miami Beach.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So, he was--

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.668 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: He actually
got projected.

00:21:29.668 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was projected out.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: This non-sustainable
local warp space bubble

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
generated from
the thunderstorms.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
just in a second here

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
how that actually is done.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But when he was
over Miami Beach,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:84%
this was like a second
had transacted here.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I figure.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And he went 100 miles
in about a second,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
which means he traveled
360,000 miles an hour.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah, just like that.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And didn't
even know it.

00:22:01.825 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Didn't even feel it, right?

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Other than
that preliminary feeling

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:84%
of a slight sense
of weightlessness

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and a slight hydroplaning
of the aircraft

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:90%
as he went through the tunnel.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that was really
fascinating to hear the story.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It took me another
couple of years

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what was
really going on in there.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So, I began to analyze and look
at the internal thunderstorm

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
structures for the
electric field,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and came up with-- Earl Wilson,
in 1984, did a lot of research

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:90%
on thunderstorm electrification.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And what he defined was a
very special tripole field.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And this would be designated as
plus at the top of the cloud,

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
minus at the freezing level in
the middle of the cloud, minus

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
again, and then
plus on the bottom.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And that constitutes what we
refer to as a tripole field.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So, two dipole fields, one
upright and one inverse.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you get two
thunderstorms together,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:10%
you get two tripole
fields facing each other.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And what I discovered
in the lab was

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:10%
there's a cross-piece
that comes.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:10%
And when the fields
cross, they can actually

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:10%
alter the fabric of space.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.730 align:middle line:90%
So, if we look back at it--

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This sounds
like "Star Trek."

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: And nature does it.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the intriguing part about
this, is nature's done this.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do, and
what I've done in my lab,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is to recreate this artificial--
getting the fabric of space

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:90%
to actually compress.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So, if we were to look at an
accordion as normal space,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
spread out like this,
here's distance from a to b.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we compress
it, we still have

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that distance between
the back and front

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:90%
part of the accordion.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But now we're just going
over a to b on this aspect.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Still the same distance, but
they're-- so as you compress

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
the fabric of
space, you can jump.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, you're working
on something that is

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:90%
similar to what nature creates.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Absolutely.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was
the investigation

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
done with Bruce
Gernon's flight in 1970

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that led me to discover
this particular function,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:90%
this anomaly within the clouds.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he was able
to get a linear displacement

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
led me to start researching
some other cases that

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:90%
claimed the same thing.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had a case from World
War II, Leland O'Brien.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a Tiger Moth pilot
that was testing out

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:90%
some radar devices in 1940.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was in North London,
got caught up in a thunderstorm

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:90%
late afternoon.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was ready to
just turn himself over.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:90%
God, take me.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.272 align:middle line:84%
And he spotted a hole
between these thunderstorms.

00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that one of those
holes you were talking about?

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Exactly.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And he saw a blue sky
on the other side.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Put the aircraft
right through there.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:90%
He ended up in northern England.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How fast did it
take him to pop over there?

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: He was
just, like, a second.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: He was in
an open cockpit.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Tiger Moth's a bi-wing aircraft.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
So, he was in an open cockpit.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And this bubble forms
up and around him--

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.257 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't feel
the speed or anything?

00:25:32.257 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Phew.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:90%
He was gone.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a wormhole.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, we don't want
to talk about the wormhole.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.961 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different
kind of structure.

00:25:39.961 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But a warp bubble actually
protects the crew.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.938 align:middle line:84%
The crew will never
feel the momentum.

00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Miguel Alcubierre, 1994,
came up with a theory

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
of how to generate a
warp bubble artificially.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, his
initial stab at this

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
required energy of the
universe to make the bubble.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It has since been whittled
down to Jupiter, the equivalent

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
force of a weight of
a Voyager spacecraft,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the amount of energy that you
would use to translate that

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:90%
to a warp bubble.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But we discovered, as a result
of studying the thunderstorms--

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:90%
we brought this into the lab.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've been able to generate
warp bubbles less than 25 watts

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:90%
of power.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a system
that we've developed

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that's over 4,000
watts of power.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And our goal is to lift things
off the ground with this.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And we've been very successful
in 500 watts, 1 newton, 1,000

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:90%
watts, 2 newtons of force.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And it goes kind
of exponentially.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So, as you get up with
the amount of newton

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:84%
forces that you could begin
to lift off practical weights

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.929 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't done this
yet, because we're still

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in the testing mode
of the motor, which

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:84%
emulates the tripole
fields of the thunderstorm.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a website,
Spaceport Dynamics LLC.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Just type all that in.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You can get to all the
pictures and the photographs

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:90%
that we have of the engine.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We've made 15 different models.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.267 align:middle line:84%
The latest one is the icing
on the cake kind of stuff.

00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you use
this in space flight?

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Our ultimate goal
is to get to space.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Originally, we wanted
to be able to take

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%
a terrestrial craft off
the ground, go to space,

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and transition.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going to
have to do a little bit more

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:90%
crawling along.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But the motor functions
to such a degree that

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:90%
at the just 2 newtons of force--

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
mean by newtons of force?

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: This is the
equivalent of work energy

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:90%
that you would have.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess to give an
example, would be like

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:84%
a small little rocket, an Estes
rocket with the small charges.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And you would be into the
area of about 5 ounces,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and getting a 2-newton force to
lift 5 ounces off the ground.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
sound like a lot.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in
space, that's a lot

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:84%
of energy in comparison
to the ion drives

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that exist out in space
right now, like Project Dawn.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
That's only a 0.99 newtons
of force that's out there.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
That's 0.99 hundredths
of a newton.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
saying nature

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
is creating this as well
in areas like the Bermuda

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Triangle.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yes, that's correct.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I guess if you
were to approach

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the scientific community,
they would probably

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.720 align:middle line:84%
say that's impossible and
all this type of thing.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've
seen it happen.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, we generate
it in our lab all the time.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've spent about three
and a half years now developing

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:90%
the hardware.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And I first came into the lab,
I built a specialized antenna.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:90%
We had an interferometer.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
We measured the
compression of a laser beam

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
into the interferometer
between the two antennas

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
that we had generated.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And we moved up from there.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.552 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, how do you
make this thing practical?

00:29:43.552 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can make all
the measurements I want.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:90%
We had red shift in it.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We had the compression
aspects of it.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We're able to move ferrous
and non-ferrous material

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
on a torsion bar with
monofilament line in a glass

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:84%
case with the wood top
and bottom, sealed.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to position
the motor up to 140 centimeters

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.780 align:middle line:84%
away and actually pull the
material towards the motor.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So, we have a pulling engine.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thrusting engine.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a V.
And we shaped the field,

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:90%
varying the V shape of it.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:10%
We use fractal
technology in the engine

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:10%
to miniaturize the field so
that our engine right now

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.537 align:middle line:10%
is about 2 foot in length.

00:30:34.537 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how big would
you need one for, let's say,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:90%
a commercial plane?

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Oh, a commercial plane?

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Really, a lot of this is
focused on how much energy

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
do we have available to us.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:84%
We would end up making
a motor and actually

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
have several of
them in a pod that

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:90%
would attach to the aircraft.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of our design.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a pod shape.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
would be able to go

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.620 align:middle line:90%
from LA to New York how fast?

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.544 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: In a matter of seconds.

00:31:04.544 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you kidding me?

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: No, I'm not.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Up and over
and you're down.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Correct.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:10%
And this is realistic?

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:10%
You're convinced 20 years
from now we'll be doing this?

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: I'm hoping
within the next five years

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that we actually have an
opportunity to go to space,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:84%
we'll be showing our engine
to a number of major players

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:90%
in the near future.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing, David.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean to be able
to travel like that

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:90%
would be just unbelievable.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Initially, like I
said, in comparison to the Dawn

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.704 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft, they are able
to go 26,700 miles an hour.

00:31:47.704 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There go my
peanuts on a plane.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no time to get them.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.115 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: With this motor, as
it stands right now, with our 2

00:31:55.115 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
newtons of force-- and we can do
this at 1,000 watts of power--

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
they have available on
a typical spacecraft

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:90%
2,000 to 4,000 watts of power.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.044 align:middle line:84%
Ours would go 30
million miles an hour.

00:32:07.044 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 30 million
miles an hour.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.041 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Based on
the same impulse--

00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd get to Mars in
an hour and a half, two hours.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:10%
I've got some
questions here for you.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Sure.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.424 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Larry from Portland.

00:32:19.424 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:10%
He says, "Do you
believe that we'll ever

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:10%
uncover the mystery behind the
disappearances in the Bermuda

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:10%
Triangle?"

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, like
I said, a lot of it

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is encounters with
really severe weather.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The whiteouts occur a lot,
squalls, heavy rain activity.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
When you get into massive
amounts of rain coming down

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're caught
into the squall,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:84%
an engine failure is
possible, you know?

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:90%
You're toast.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.034 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Engine manufacturers--
jet engines, in particular-- I

00:32:57.034 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:84%
mean, I've seen
some of the films.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.409 align:middle line:84%
They just pour water into
these things like crazy.

00:33:01.409 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to make them fail.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they
want them to fail.

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Exactly.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But a propeller-driven
aircraft, you get in there

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.172 align:middle line:84%
and the water's coming through,
gets up into the carburetor,

00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and then you stall out.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:14.792 align:middle line:90%
You stall out.

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.044 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: You're down.

00:33:16.044 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's serious.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:10%
"What advice," according to
Cynthia in Lubbock, Texas,

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:10%
"would you give to people
who know they're flying

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:10%
in the Bermuda Triangle?"

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.534 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Check the weather.

00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:10%
It's a high-pressure--

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But it seems
to pop up pretty fast.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah, it does.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Modern technology,
larger aircraft--

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of restrictions
with larger airliners, anyway.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
fly near thunderstorms.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
The new regulations only
put you within 20 miles

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:90%
of a thunderstorm.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
These things generate
gamma rays as well.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And these things
also have anti-matter

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:90%
inside the thunderstorms.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize this--

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: --but
these thunderstorms

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:90%
are extremely powerful.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:84%
If we can ever
tap into just one,

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.899 align:middle line:90%
it would light up the whole US--

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For a long time.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.409 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: --for a whole year.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And you'd even have
some left over.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.199 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's positrons.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
That's a half million
electron volts

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:84%
for every execution
of the positron.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Anti-matter.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And all this is generated
because of this 10

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to the 15th watts of power
within these massive storms.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you fly through
the Bermuda Triangle right now

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.243 align:middle line:90%
knowing what you know about it?

00:34:29.243 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Oh, I'm sure.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or take a ship?

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Or take a ship.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have
been-- again it's

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong place,
the wrong time.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
The best way to go
through would be obviously

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:90%
a high-pressure system.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I had to
advise somebody--

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
and I have advised some
crews of Air Force tankers

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that have called and asked,
what should we be looking for?

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've told them this is
the scenarios that you should

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
be looking for,
and that you need

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to stay away as far
as possible from some

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of these mammoth thunderstorms,
because they generate

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:84%
so much electrical
energy, is that it's

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.740 align:middle line:84%
a bi-directional flow--
that they shoot up to space

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:84%
to almost 300 miles, the
Red Sprites and Blue Jets.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And they also transition
to the surface as well

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and form a lightning
and all that.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
potential energy there.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
old days, when we

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
didn't have metal craft, or
ships, or instrumentation,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
merely wooden ships-- the
Santa Maria and things

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
like that-- would they still
be affected by the Bermuda

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Triangle?

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: Well, the encounter
of this electronic fog

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:84%
or the electrification
of the air.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Columbus
wrote in one of his logs

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.257 align:middle line:84%
that he encountered a strange
cloud that surrounded the ship.

00:35:53.257 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was in one of these.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Yeah.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And in recent times, 1904
in August, early August,

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the "Mohegan," which
is a steamship-- iron--

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:90%
was near the Delaware Water Gap.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And they encountered just
an ominous-looking cloud,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:84%
which was independent of
the rest of the clouds.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- had a gray cast
to it, and it covered the ship.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.552 align:middle line:84%
And they reported in
the newspaper back then

00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the chains of the ship,
they couldn't pull them

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.570 align:middle line:90%
off the deck.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.653 align:middle line:10%
Everything was magnetized.

00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:31.486 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Magnetized.

00:36:31.486 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: And they had this--

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: --smell, a sulphuric
smell to this cloud.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.577 align:middle line:10%
And after about an hour
and a half or so, it just--

00:36:41.577 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dissipated.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: --wandered
off the ship.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:90%
But it drove the crew crazy.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet it would.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I bet it would.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: And they
were very upset.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:84%
When they docked, they
reported it to the newspaper

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:84%
as being a very
strange encounter.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.025 align:middle line:84%
So, whether it be
marine or air, the area

00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
of the Bermuda
Triangle has a lot

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
to offer as far as anomalies go.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:10%
But again, a lot of these
things that we discuss here

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:10%
today can be seen in other
portions around the world.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not just there.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.738 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: It's not just there.

00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
I studied that was

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:84%
because I had more
availability of weather

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.288 align:middle line:84%
records that I could then
begin to see as a trend.

00:37:25.288 --> 00:37:26.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:26.088 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a good way
for a comparison.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PARES: Exactly.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your website, David?

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.276 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: It's
spacewarpdynamicsllc.com

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You got to get
that LLC in there, right?

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:10%
>>PARES: Well, just type in
Space Warp Dynamics and you'll

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:10%
get it.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You'll
still get it too.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:10%
Hey, thanks for
being on the program.

>>PARES: You're welcome.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since I
was a little boy,

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned at
the top of the show,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated with
the things and occurrences

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
at the Bermuda Triangle.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to know that
someone like David Pares also,

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
when he was a young guy,
was fascinated by it too.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:90%
There's something to it.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing area.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if I'd hesitate
flying through there or not.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.301 align:middle line:10%
I probably don't have
much of a choice, do I?

00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PARES: If the airline
is going that way,

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
that's where you're going.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.994 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."
