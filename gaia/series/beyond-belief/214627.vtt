What a life you've had.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDY GILLMORE: Yeah.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, honestly,
the last thing

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that I ever thought that I
would be doing is self-healing.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.145 align:middle line:90%
That's been really pivotal.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about these episodes

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.486 align:middle line:90%
that really affected you.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLMORE: Basically,
first and foremost,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:10%
I think healing
with the mind would

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:10%
have sounded impossible to me.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So when I was first injured,
if somebody had told me

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that I could heal
using my mind, I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:84%
would have thought
that they were crazy

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't
understand my condition.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
some of the research

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:84%
was eye-opening for me as far as
people with multiple personality

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
disorder can have different
ailments when they're

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
in different personalities.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And starting to find the
research was pivotal.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say
that to me, really--

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
there's so much that really got
me here to where I am today, so.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to you?

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLMORE: So I used to
work in network engineering

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:10%
operations, so
telecommunications basically.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And basically I had a car
accident and then I had a fall.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even
that bad of a fall,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.415 align:middle line:84%
but I fell just
wrong, just right,

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
however you want to say it.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two separate events?

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Two separate events.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I went from
living a full life to then

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
being wheelchair, walker,
cane, an absolute mess.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
On a good day, I could get
around with my wheelchair

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
or walker or cane.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
And on a bad day I didn't
make it out of bed.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I was on all kinds of
medication, morphine

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
medication for years.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.662 align:middle line:84%
And basically my doctor said
that there was not really

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
anything else they
could do for me.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had been going through
nerve ablations, infusions,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:90%
injections, all of that.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But each doctor
kept saying, there's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.245 align:middle line:90%
nothing else they could do.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brandy, let's
start with the car accident.

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:29.375 align:middle line:90%
What happened

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know,
it wasn't even that bad.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a car accident.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
happened is I got

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.422 align:middle line:84%
hit on the front, right side,
front passenger side of the car.

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I just had
a bad back, if you will.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like you continue
through life--

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
kinked up, right?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: What's that?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were kinked up.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.203 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: It was--
like a kinked up,

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:90%
we could call it that.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I was injured, but
still working, still

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:90%
going through life.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.412 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
you have back pain?

00:02:56.412 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was me.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was fine.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't great.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:90%
But then-- then I had this fall.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happens
is that after I fell--

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
there's a neurological condition
where it's like your body

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:90%
kind of--

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system is kind of
attacking itself, if you will,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:90%
or it's not--

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It's over-- it's like an
abnormal response where

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:90%
it's really heightened.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
ultimately what I had.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.182 align:middle line:90%
But I had all of this pain.

00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And I also, I mean, I
had other things as well.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I had spinal endplate
fractures, nerve--

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.832 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of the fall?

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: A
combination of things.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound like
you were falling apart.

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: [LAUGHS]
I was falling apart.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
You know it's
just-- that's what--

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
the fall happen?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.815 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: It's all, like--
honestly, I slipped on water

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and I fell on the floor.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And I fell just
wrong, just right.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.473 align:middle line:84%
However you want to say
it, but I fell on my spine.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The way they described
it was like this.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Was like-- they said--

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the doctors
described it was like,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
imagine a Coke can
where if you crunch it,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
it's pushing on all the nerves
and everything like that.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Is what one person described it.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:90%
But basically, I was a mess.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
All I know is
this, myself, I had

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
razor blades of pain
shooting through my body,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what I did,
I couldn't get out of pain.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who diagnosed you?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I had so
many different doctors.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I would say that what
happened is at first,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
you go to the doctor
and after it happened,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
they said, OK, well,
just lay there.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's like one
thing after another.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Is-- how do I put it?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:90%
You go see one doctor.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And then they said--

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the first thing
I was diagnosed with

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
was nerve lesions, nerve lesions
and spondylosis and sciatica

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:90%
and so it just--

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
it was through a
series of things.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So that was the first.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep
going to specialists

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and then they go, oh, well, you
also have reduced bone density.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's like one thing
after another after another.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.063 align:middle line:84%
So it is an unfoldment,
if you will.

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they know what
they were talking about?

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, I
always like to give everybody

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
What I do know--

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In retrospect now?

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: This is
what I would say.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.833 align:middle line:84%
I think that, in retrospect,
what would I say?

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say I was in an
extreme amount of pain

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they
want to call it

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
all I know is that I was
injured for six and a half,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
almost seven years,
and it was horrible.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
I would say, is--

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So CRPS, complex regional pain
syndrome or reflex dystrophy,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:90%
that was given--

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that label was given
about, I don't know,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years in or so,
maybe two, I don't know.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's an unfoldment.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.435 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were some of the
normal things you tried to do

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to get your life back in order?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: The normal
things I tried to do--

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think we all try to
push through and just be OK.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But after my injury, I
would get injections,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
so they would do injections or
I would go and get infusions.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you on pills?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.675 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I was on
all kinds of pills.

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:30.475 align:middle line:90%
I was on--

00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oxy?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I was on oxy for a
while, but it made me really--

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's addictive.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, it
made me really agitated.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I was on it for
only a few months.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just
please take me off.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So then I went on this
24 hour morphine, avenza.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was on that for a while,
but I think it's off the market

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I was on a variety of Norco,
Neurontin, Naprosyn, Vioxx,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
before it was taken off the
market for killing people.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:90%
So I was on Vioxx.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.525 align:middle line:84%
Then they told me--
they just called me

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
up, my doctor's office, and
they told me, stop taking it.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't tell me why.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was--

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was taken off the
market for killing people.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you decide
to take a different approach?

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I decided to
take a different approach--

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
the whole time, after they said
that I wasn't going to heal--

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So I said the first year I felt
like I was in a waiting pattern.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, I would-- it's like,
wait for the next specialist.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So you wait, and you
wait a couple more weeks

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and a couple more weeks
and they say, OK, well, you

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.997 align:middle line:84%
can get into this
next specialist.

00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It's only three weeks away.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So then I just kind of would
try to distract myself and watch

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
TV and zone out and try not
to be frustrated with the pain

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
until that day.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Until that day.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would say I did that
probably for the first year.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when they kept saying--
one doctor after another kept

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
saying, there's nothing else we
could do, I would literally--

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:90%
I would beg.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I would say, but there's got
to be something, some referral.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Any time any doctor would
say there's nothing else,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I would say, but--

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
but there's somebody, something,
because I couldn't just give up.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
So then they--

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
begging for help.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: I was begging.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I was begging.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And so-- so then they
would say, well, I

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
could give you a
referral to so-and-so.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And so then I would
take that referral.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And then also in
the waiting rooms,

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to other
people who were also injured

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and we'd say, well,
what have you tried?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And what have you tried?

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was just trying
to figure out something.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So then I tried all the
normal steps of saying,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, let me try
diet and supplements.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
So I tried doing that, diet
and supplements and anything

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that could help my
body to heal itself.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And my thought was, well, let
me speed up my body's repair

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But then I started
to think about it

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and I realized,
well, my body was

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
kind of repairing
pretty well anyway.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I had a nerve
ablation, my nerves grew back.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
thinking about the fact

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies are constantly
repairing and replacing cells.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, science
even estimates we

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
have approximately a new
skeleton about every 10 years.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, wait a second.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible for people to
have that old football injury--

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.152 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted your new
skeleton right now, right?

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Well, yeah.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I also started
counting by the years.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
gosh, I've been

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:90%
injured for quite many years.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But also, how is it
possible for people

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to be injured for so many
years If the body is constantly

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:90%
repairing and replacing cells?

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
that really struck me.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I started finding
more and more research

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that started opening my eyes
to think in a different way.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that happened was this,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is as I was hoping that somebody
would invent something new

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and that I would
get my life back.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
So I was just hoping.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And I would go to this hospital.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
two, three, four doctors

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
would come in the
room at the same time

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.912 align:middle line:84%
and they'd try to make a
plan to figure you out.

00:10:01.912 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So they'd all kind of assess
and then they'd go and--

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all had
their own opinions, right?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: They'd go
collect their minds together

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
for a treatment plan or whatnot.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so they'd--

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And so because I just
wasn't willing to give up,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
but as I was going
to this center,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
a study for a new
treatment came up

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and they said that I could
be a part of this study.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, oh, my gosh,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm going to
get my life back.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My prayers have
been answered, right?

00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly, exactly.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a kid counting
down the days for Christmas.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I was like-- until the study.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I was counting down
the days to this study.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And finally the day comes
and my friend picked me up

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and she took me to the study and
she wheeled me in my wheelchair,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and I get into the hospital.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse starts prepping
me for the procedure,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.603 align:middle line:84%
gets me in the gurney,
and I'm laying there.

00:10:54.603 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
She's monitoring my vitals.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor, he comes in and
he looks at me and he says--

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.162 align:middle line:90%
he's looking at his chart.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
You could just see something
was off and he's looking down.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:90%
He's looking at me.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, miss Gillmore,

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:90%
we don't expect you to heal.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a
part of this study.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't expect
it's going to work.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.436 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:15.644 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were devastated.

00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I felt like I
just swallowed an orange.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
My throat was just like--

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
choke back tears.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I was not doing a
very good job at it.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just said it, just
please, I'll try anything.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:90%
And so it just--

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
what was pivotal, though, is
this, is that basically he did.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
He ended up giving
me the injections.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was right,
they didn't work

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
because I said, but please got
to do something and I'll try it.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And initially he
said, well, you're

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
going to mess up the
results in the study.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was frustrated and I said,
but I came all the way here.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So technically, the treatment
that they were going to give me

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:90%
had already been--

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:84%
had already a lot
of testing on it.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were going to
bring their numbers down

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
want that to happen.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly what he said.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How depressed were you?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: God, I was a mess.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I was a mess.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.165 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
live after that.

00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean
you didn't want to live?

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: It's like--
I call it exit strategy.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
My brain after that,
even at times--

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
contemplate suicide?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know
what's so funny?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That when we call
names to something--

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
like, sometimes people will
say, well, were you suicidal?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And that label, I
don't like that label,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
but I can tell you this.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
People would be driving
me to the hospital and I

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
would be laying against the
door in the passenger side--

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hoping the
door would open.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: And I
would be thinking,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.693 align:middle line:84%
what if I just opened
it and fell out?

00:12:45.693 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I would think somebody
would probably run me over

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.818 align:middle line:84%
and then I would be
worse off and I would

00:12:49.818 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:90%
be mangled and in more pain.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And not dead.

00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Not dead.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.288 align:middle line:84%
And then other times I would
hear the trash truck drive by

00:12:57.288 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
why the trash truck,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
but it was the trash truck.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would think I wonder if
I could get my wheelchair fast

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
enough and push myself in front
of it and just end it all.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have this
thought that says, well,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I probably have on a tombstone
"died by trash truck,"

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and I don't want to have that.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
also think, well,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I would feel bad for the
driver who killed me.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And so people try to
label it suicidal.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I always say it was
like my brain was

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.535 align:middle line:84%
on autopilot trying to think
about how I could exit life.

00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:39.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
snap out of that?

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I got to this place
where I said research was like--

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
research became my addiction and
my form of emotional survival.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, on days, if I would
just research and research

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and research, I
could keep myself out

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
of the deep depression
and into hope.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you meditate?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.225 align:middle line:84%
Did you do other
holistic things?

00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:03.855 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I did a lot
of meditation for years.

00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:05.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Didn't work?

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: I could bliss out.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:90%
So I enjoyed meditation.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It didn't heal me,
but I enjoyed it.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I spent hours and
hours and hours a day

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
meditating and thinking positive
and chanting and affirmations

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and all of the things.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it just--

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:90%
gosh, so many things.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Binaural beats.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff is really,
really-- it can be really great.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that for me,
I think that after a while,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.095 align:middle line:84%
it kind of became my
coping mechanism also.

00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect is
when they test somebody

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
with somebody else
who's on medicine,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and the person on the placebo
effect is not given medicine,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
they're given a sugar pill
or something like that.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
they cure themselves

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.312 align:middle line:90%
thinking that it's working.

00:15:01.312 --> 00:15:02.595 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever try that?

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, so
this is what happened.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So after that whole
experiment didn't work out,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what I thought.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, what
about the placebo?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about the placebo is

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
people usually don't have
a cure from the placebo.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times what
happens from the placebo

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is people will their
symptoms will change,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
necessarily cure them.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But what was fascinating is I
thought, well, the placebo, we

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
can see that the mind can affect
the physical body because they

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They take a fake pill
and they can have

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:90%
real physiological changes.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did after
that is I thought,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm just going to believe
that I'm already healed.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.235 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
OK, I'm just going

00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful for my healing
and believe I'm already healed

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and visualize myself
already healed.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing that.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:57.122 align:middle line:84%
And I thought initially that the
placebo was just due to belief.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had been doing
that for more than a

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
year, just trying to push myself
to believe I was already healed.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
getting any better?

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: No.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And then what I found was that--

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I started researching deeper.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, well,
why isn't this working?

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm believing I'm
already healed.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling myself I'm healed.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing myself healed.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't working.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I found there's
something called the open label

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.225 align:middle line:90%
placebo.

00:16:23.225 --> 00:16:24.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: It is exactly--

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that
was my first response,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:90%
like, what is this?

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: It is
exactly like it sounds.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It is open label.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So both the doctor
and the patient

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.848 align:middle line:90%
both know it's a placebo.

00:16:40.848 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They both know it's
a fake treatment.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.057 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coming in
you know it's a fake.

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:45.349 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: And it still works.

00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:46.149 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:47.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
power of the mind.

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Yes.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, wait a second.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Then clearly it's
more than just belief.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made me--
when we first sat down,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I said that multiple
personality disorder,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that people could have
different illnesses

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and different personalities.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
led me to start
looking beyond, is

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, the placebo I
thought it was all about belief.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized when I found
the open-label placebo, well,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
this isn't all
about belief at all.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the more I researched
the medical journals,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.620 align:middle line:84%
the more I found so many things
that multiple personality

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%
That was eye opening.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
There was even a study
or a case of a woman who

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
was blind in some personalities
and not in others,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
or other cases--

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she could
see in another case.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
She could see in
other personalities.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Or people would have
asthma in one personality.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, did you think
you had multiple personalities?

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: No, but at
the time I was like, well,

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
how do I get a personality
that's healthy?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: And I have
so much compassion--

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were willing
to try anything, right?

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.423 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly.

00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to joke around
about multiple personality

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:84%
disorder because I have so much
compassion for those people.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But yeah-- but that was
my thought was, well,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
how do I get a
personality that's healed?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was that
aha moment for you?

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
That moment where
you said to yourself,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the path of healing?

00:18:15.515 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, I
think that there was--

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:90%
there were so many of them.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:84%
One of them was just as I
started to get my strength back.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
As I started-- my pain started
going down and staying down.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
was with meditation

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I could get my
pain to come down,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
but then it would
always come back.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Or I could start feeling
better and then it was--

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So it had a lot of
ups and down days.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started to
consistently feel better,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:90%
that was pivotal.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
When I said, oh,
my gosh, this is--

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually going to heal.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.855 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
going to happen.

00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you to that level?

00:18:55.355 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: This is what
got me to that level.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a pivotal
moment that I said this.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I had been believing, doing
the belief, the meditation, all

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
of the things.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this
point where I said,

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
look, how long do I need to
meditate to be able to heal?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because everything was
pointing at the mind.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The meditation
wasn't working for you.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But when I said exactly
that, when I said,

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
how long do I need to
meditate to activate

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:90%
the mind-body healing mechanism?

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked the
question, well, wait a second.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:84%
When people take the
placebo, how long

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
do they have to meditate
to get the mind body

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:90%
connection to work?

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, they don't.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, with multiple
personality disorder,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.133 align:middle line:84%
a person can have one
illness and one personality

00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and a completely
different illness

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and a different personality.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
How long do they have to
meditate to get that to work?

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer was zero.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it dawned on me that
the mind body connection

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't require meditation
at all to activate.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, nothing bad
against meditation,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but that was pivotal for
me, when I started saying,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, I've been
meditating for five years

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not healing, but I see
that the mind-body connection

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:90%
can work.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
That was pivotal.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how do I activate

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
this mind-body connection then
faster to then get results?

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was a pivotal
moment in discovery for me.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people, Brandy,
use music as a coping mechanism.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Did you?

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:39.105 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I ended up using
music to retrain my mind.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me an example.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLMORE: One of the
things that I did is--

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:10%
I read research that has shown
that optimism can speed up

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:10%
cell proliferation.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:10%
So optimism can actually
speed up healing in the body.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And even after surgery,
people who are more optimistic

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
heal faster and people
who after surgery,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
if they're in fear
or in stress, they

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
can have more complications.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:90%
So optimism--

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, well,
let me get more

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.202 align:middle line:90%
of this emotion of optimism.

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I need to start
feeling better about life.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
well, how am I going

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
to start feeling better
about life genuinely

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:90%
when I'm such a mess?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.223 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm fearful,
my life is a mess.

00:21:22.223 --> 00:21:23.306 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're depressed.

00:21:23.306 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Depressed,
all these things.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So I started listening to a
song by U2 called Beautiful Day.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And it says, it's
a beautiful day.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it slip away.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
When at the time all I do
wanted to do was slip away.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a good song.

00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: It is a good song.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:90%
It is a good song.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So I would listen to this
song and I wouldn't just

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:90%
listen to it like--

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I would listen to it and I
would focus my whole mind

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
on seeing the beauty in life
and taking it in and feeling

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
the feeling and
amplifying the feeling

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:90%
as much as I possibly could.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So I would feel the feeling.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
As much as I possibly could
to amplify that emotion.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it started
working for you?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: It started working.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way to
think about it is like this.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:84%
For us to memorize
anything, like the alphabet,

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:90%
how do we memorize the alphabet?

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to get it
in over and over

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and over and over
again to memorize it.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Or a new language.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:90%
We learn a new language.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.983 align:middle line:84%
We have to get it in
over and over and over.

00:22:24.983 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We memorize it.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, how am I going
to get this feeling of feeling

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
optimism over and over and over
and over again when I don't have

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
anything to feel
optimistic about,

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any happiness?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well, I better use
this song to hack the process.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what it did is I
kind of borrowed the emotion

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
from that song.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I used it to really help
me cultivate those feelings

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
as much as I could so I could
get them in over and over

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
did you listen to it?

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Oh.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:84%
When I was at my worst, I
would listen to it every hour,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:90%
if not more.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.482 align:middle line:90%
It was of like re-upping.

00:23:01.482 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Because
I started to--

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I would start to go
down into depression.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.615 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like, OK,
it's time-- it's

00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:90%
time to re-up on the happiness.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
That song and another
one I listened to

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
was Walking On Sunshine
by Katrina and The Waves.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Walking on sunshine--

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (SINGING)
Walking on sunshine.

00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:18.523 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: And it's
going to feel good.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.323 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classics.

00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Uh-huh.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then when did
you start feeling better?

00:23:24.665 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, I did
a combination of things.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
What I started doing was
bringing in feelings of optimism

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
because optimism had
shown to speed up healing.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So I started bringing in
optimism and feeling it.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I also started
identifying specific emotions

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in my subconscious mind and
started also releasing those.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it's
the combination of that,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.034 align:middle line:84%
of identifying what negative
emotions were in my subconscious

00:23:58.034 --> 00:23:59.076 align:middle line:90%
mind and releasing those.

00:23:59.076 --> 00:24:01.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, interesting,
Freud, Sigmund Freud

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
used to do that very
thing in psychology

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of identifying negative patterns
in the subconscious mind

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of them
for people's stress levels.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what I started or--
anxiety and things like that.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what I started doing
was bringing in positive

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and then also identifying
negative in my subconscious mind

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and getting rid of it.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does gratitude
or thankfulness help?

00:24:28.265 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: That
one's a little tricky.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a little tricky.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
why, is that we

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
want to bring in more and
more positive emotions

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:47.671 align:middle line:84%
and that's key for
healing, but what happens--

00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a bigger
picture to this.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:90%
So I would say this.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when people have
an injury or illness, there's

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:90%
a combination of emotions.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Is the combination of emotions.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the combination of
emotions that's affecting them

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is guilt, is feeling
like a bad person,

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.715 align:middle line:84%
is feeling self criticism, even
if somebody has done nothing--

00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:15.476 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Beating
themselves down, right?

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Beating
themselves down,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
even if they've done
nothing wrong, though.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had a feeling
of survivor's guilt

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
in my subconscious mind from
9/11 that I didn't even realize

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
feel guilty about that?

00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You know, I,
as silly as it sounds,

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I grew up very much
in religion and I

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
had a feeling of that
you're like, sacrifice,

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed to
sacrifice ourselves for others.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It was my programming was that I
was supposed to sacrifice myself

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
for others.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
So that was one thing.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I would say also, I had this
belief or this programming

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that it was good to feel
guilt. Like, if you felt guilt,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
it meant that you
were a good person.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like a silly thing.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But basically, as a child,
I had linked up somewhere

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
along the way that if you feel
guilt, it means you're good,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
it means you have a conscience,
it means you have a heart.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.075 align:middle line:84%
And so at a subconscious
level, it was linked up.

00:26:21.075 --> 00:26:26.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
then mind over matter works?

00:26:26.045 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: I would say it's
not mind over matter at all.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.628 align:middle line:90%
Believe me, I tried that one.

00:26:29.628 --> 00:26:30.946 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:30.946 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Then what is it?

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
What is that special
thing that healed you,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.110 align:middle line:90%
that heals other people?

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.955 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: This is what
I began to figure out.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So as I was trying to figure
out the placebo, the open label

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.470 align:middle line:84%
placebo, multiple
personality disorder.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gratitude.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Gratitude,
all of these things,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I started simplifying
it and I said, look,

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:90%
how can I see the emotion--

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
or how can I see that the
mind affects the body?

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Emotions.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is embarrassed,
their face turns red.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Emojis know that
on our cell phone.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.208 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: We all know that.

00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Or even panic attack.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Racing heart,
shortness of breath.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And so we all know panic attack.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, but I need
a lot more than emotions

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:90%
to heal my body.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
thinking about it,

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
people can die of
a broken heart.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
People can also be
scared to death.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
They're so scared
their heart stops.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I started doing
was looking at the awareness

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that different emotions can
affect the body differently.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
A sexual thought
and a sexual emotion

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
affects people differently
than panic attack or anxiety.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I started questioning
and I said, well, wait a second.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
If emotions can affect
us to the point of death,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
what are happening to
these other emotions?

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, research
has also shown--

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
there's studies that suggest
that autoimmune conditions can

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
be caused by stress or we even
with psychoneuroimmunology,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that stress can affect
the immune system.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all of
these links where stress,

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and what is stress?

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
These negative
emotions, can affect

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the immune system
and anxiety and panic

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
understand the emotions

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:84%
that were in the
subconscious mind

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and how they could
impact the physical body.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.131 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was pivotal.

00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:36.816 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think you
got out of that wheelchair?

00:28:36.816 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Basically
I started identifying

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that I had subconscious
fears that were affecting me.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like this.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.865 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard the phrase
before paralyzed by fear?

00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:51.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:52.465 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: OK.

00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:53.648 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't paralyzed--

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still paralysis.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: OK.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't actually paralyzed.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I was in-- my muscles
were not firing correctly

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and my nerves were all
burning and all of that,

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't paralyzed.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But when we think about
emotions, they impact us.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I had always
been very, very--

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I could push through anything.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Macho girl.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.435 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Macho, exactly.

00:29:18.435 --> 00:29:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember like, the
one time my mother

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
cried when I was growing up.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, emotions even in
the corporate world.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It was like, emotions-- leave
your emotions at the door.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't something
that I would have ever thought

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.110 align:middle line:90%
my emotions couldn't affect me.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:90%
That would be weak.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:90%
I was macho for that.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:90%
But they're very real.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we think about it for
a moment, a lot of people

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:90%
do this very thing.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
If we think about
somebody all the time,

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
people will go to
the emergency room

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and they think they're
having a heart attack.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out they're
actually having a panic attack.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize
they're even experiencing

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:90%
panicking emotions.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And panicking emotions
feel like heart attacks.

00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Exactly.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And so point being is that
it's like these emotions

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
in our subconscious mind are
affecting our physical bodies

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and we don't even realize it.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I had buried all
of these emotions so much

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.517 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize I was in fear.

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:84%
If somebody had asked me
if I had fear towards it,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.595 align:middle line:84%
I would have said, I'm only
worried about people in 9/11.

00:30:23.595 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say was
the single biggest factor that

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:90%
got you out of that wheelchair?

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: As crazy as
it may or may not sound,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
identifying the specific
emotions and shifting them,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:90%
creating huge--

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
like shifting my emotions,
so much so that it shifted

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:90%
my mindset in a radical way.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to have you
explain in a moment the five

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:90%
factors for healing next.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that, I want
to show our watchers and viewers

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
some of the miracles of your
healing and how it works.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.608 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREA JOHNSON: My
name is Andrea Johnson

00:31:02.608 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and I would like to speak a
little bit about my journey

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:84%
with Brandy Gillmore
and my healing process.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I met Brandy about
five years ago.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I had been sick and
bedridden for six years

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and I had been supine
for that whole time.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I had tried many
different modalities.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:90%
They failed, of course.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.067 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for really
the whole package.

00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to heal and get better.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I started this
program with Brandy.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, like, right
away I could feel resolve.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I worked with her for about 18
months and exclusively with her,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and she helped me a lot change
my perceptions and my mind

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and just different releasing
techniques for releasing

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:90%
emotions and past issues.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And she really helped me
connect and understand

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:84%
with what was the issues that
was creating the illness.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And she helped me
to unmanifest it.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Her coaching the entire time
was absolutely just amazing.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.748 align:middle line:84%
She was the most
compassionate human being,

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:84%
which was something I
really needed at that time.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And she was somebody
I could count on

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and I could rely on her to
be there for me to help me

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And about nine months
into that journey,

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I walked for the first time
again in many, many years

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to my front door.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And we caught the
whole thing on video.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And it really amazing.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
share that with you.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:30.103 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.103 --> 00:32:33.049 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:34.522 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.522 --> 00:32:37.959 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER 1: My reaction.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I was just dumbfounded.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.682 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.682 --> 00:32:47.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER 2: For how long?

00:32:47.602 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREA JOHNSON: I walked
around the house for like,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes earlier
today, and that--

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So after that, the
progress continued

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and I went from walking to
running in a matter of months.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I continued to go to the gym
and weightlifting and yoga,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and she continued to
support me and coach me

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
through those
experiences and help

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
me to achieve new levels of
healing even deeper and deeper

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.410 align:middle line:84%
so that I could sustain
all these new experiences

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and this new health
that I had gotten

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that I
had learned in her video sets

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and in her group sessions.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Really set a foundation
for where I am today.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost four years,
almost four years to the day

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I started walking.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so grateful
for her and all

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that she did for me and
she helped me with and most

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
importantly, for the
gift that she taught me,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't just give me
healing for my health and body.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:90%
It literally--

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.175 align:middle line:84%
It changed my whole life in a
magnitude of many, many ways.

00:33:48.175 --> 00:33:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, Brandy.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.057 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Isn't it sweet?

00:33:51.057 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me more
about that experience.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like a miracle
you did with her.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: It was.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you also have--

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.165 align:middle line:90%
OK, so it is like a miracle.

00:33:59.165 --> 00:33:59.965 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:33:59.965 --> 00:34:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're crying.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: I'm such a softie.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I love-- I love seeing people
just heal and get better.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And-- You know, I
know what it's like.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That video
of Andrea was amazing.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But we've talked about
these five factors.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.225 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: Absolutely.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So a simple way to think
about the five factors

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is this, is as I started seeing
that different emotions affect

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the physical body, I started
questioning it objectively,

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:90%
but wait a second.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Somebody can be stressed
and not be sick?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:84%
A person can even
have PTSD and not

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:90%
have physical illness at all.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:90%
How is that even possible?

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And so as I started
looking at it objectively,

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
what I began to
realize was this,

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:53.197 align:middle line:84%
was that it takes a certain
combination of emotions.

00:34:53.197 --> 00:34:55.489 align:middle line:84%
And a simple way to think
about it is like, this is it.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.785 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wants to make
cake and they have flour,

00:34:58.785 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:90%
they can't make cake.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But if they have flour and they
mix it with other ingredients,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:03.860 align:middle line:90%
now they can make cake.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a
different recipe,

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
they can have a
completely different food.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so similarly, that's
how I started looking at it,

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:90%
where's those ingredients.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I figured
out how it was possible

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
for somebody to have
multiple personality disorder

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and have one illness and one
personality, but not in another.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And a completely different
illness and another personality.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And so these ingredients, if
you will, these five factors--

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which are?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: First and
foremost positive expectation,

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
optimism, it helps
speed up healing.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So that.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Then I call it the
NPPs and the negative--

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Negative Punishment Patterns.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And these patterns have to
do with guilt or feeling

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
bad or self-criticism,
shame, all of that.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.270 align:middle line:84%
The third one is what I
call the symptom emotion,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and that is the emotion
that is directly connected

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to the symptom.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
somebody is embarrassed,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.760 align:middle line:84%
their face turns red
or panic, anxiety,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:90%
but starting to realize--

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:90%
somebody might have a--

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:84%
for example, somebody
might have neck pain

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and they might feel that
somebody is a pain in the neck

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and that can happen.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on the emotion
that's connected to the symptom.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's number 3.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Number 4 is what I call
our mind-body-soul needs.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And our mind-body-soul needs
has to do with the emotions

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:90%
that we need.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we need
love, we need safety,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.120 align:middle line:90%
we need acknowledgment.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And so these can be
linked up to illness.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And a simple way to think
about it is like this.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Is that maybe you've
heard before somebody

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.060 align:middle line:90%
who gets love from illness.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what can happen is
love can be linked to illness.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody is in fear,
they can create illness.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Or another way to think
about it is like this,

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes people get
it linked up in their childhood

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.642 align:middle line:84%
where we've heard before,
a child may have an owie.

00:37:06.642 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of this before,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.215 align:middle line:90%
where a little kid has an owie?

00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:10.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: And somebody says,
oh, let me kiss your owie

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and make it better.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it does.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Well,
actually, at that moment,

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
love can get linked
up to illness.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And at a subconscious
level, somebody

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:84%
can link up, that illness
gets love and connection.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So-- so what I'm saying is
that the mind can be miswired.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the fourth factor.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth key factor that
I've found is self image.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And what that is that
somebody may see themselves

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
as being a person who's ill.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they've had
an illness for a while

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes their identity.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.935 align:middle line:84%
And so they have one
illness after another.

00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
they see themselves.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Or they may see themselves as
being like a parent who's sick,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they start taking
that on as their identity.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, that they're
a sick person,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.730 align:middle line:90%
they're a person who's sick.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there's these keys
in the subconscious mind

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that I have found
that are pivotal.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what I help people do
is identify these specific keys

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.145 align:middle line:84%
and help them to
create that change.

00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:17.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must you do all
five in order to heal?

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: Some people
only have two or three.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Some people have four.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.062 align:middle line:90%
Some people have mixed.

00:38:23.062 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't need
all five at the same time?

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: You don't
necessarily need all five.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the hidden
gift in self-healing?

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLMORE: The gift
is this, is that when

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
we identify the specific
negative emotions

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
in our subconscious
mind and we change them,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:90%
it becomes life changing.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, for
me, for example,

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I had guilt running
in my subconscious

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
mind, survivor's guilt running
in my subconscious mind.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.380 align:middle line:10%
And when I identified
that patterned way

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.222 align:middle line:10%
of thinking and feeling and
I changed it, it was pivotal.

00:38:55.222 --> 00:38:57.930 align:middle line:10%
So years and years and years and
years of meditation didn't work.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:10%
But when I identified
the specific emotions

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.690 align:middle line:10%
in my subconscious
mind and changed those,

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.725 align:middle line:10%
that's when it became pivotal.

00:39:05.725 --> 00:39:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a four
step program, don't you?

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: I do.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Called GIFT.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.418 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLMORE: It's called GIFT.

00:39:10.418 --> 00:39:11.360 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:10%
To simplify GIFT--

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.360 align:middle line:10%
I just want to make
it simple for people.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.110 align:middle line:10%
And so GIFT what it is is step--

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:10%
it's G-I-F-T. And G is about get
new healthy mind programming.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's like get a vision,
get positivity, get optimism.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
That's step G, is get
those new healthy emotions.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Step I is identify what's
in your subconscious mind,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
identify it and
eradicate it or--

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, identify.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Step I is identify.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Step F is actually
free yourself from it.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's when you're freeing
yourself from the negativity.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then step T
is transformation,

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:84%
which is stepping into the
transformation of it all.

or is there something grander?

I think Brandy Gillmore
has found the answer.
