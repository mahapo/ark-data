>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.237 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:12.039 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.892 align:middle line:84%

really happened.

>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.379 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And before I introduce our
special guest for this program,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
special thanks to all of you who
continue to watch and support

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and it only has
happened because of you.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest, Gregg Braden,
who is an author, scientist,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
researcher, explorer,
and an expert, of course,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
in human origin.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
One of his latest
works, "The God Code,"

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
there's something very
special about that.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: George,
it's an honor to be here,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really excited to talk
about this material today.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love you.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I have always loved your work.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.363 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, thank you.

00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it's
just thought provoking.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:90%
How did this all start for you?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
beginning of Gregg Braden.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, you want to
go back to the beginning?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
We're filming in
Denver, Colorado,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and it began right here
in Denver, Colorado

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.545 align:middle line:90%
or in the Rocky Mountain area.

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I was-- a
lot of our viewers

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
don't know this--
behind the scenes.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the defense
industry during the last years

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.194 align:middle line:84%
of the Cold War, a
very frightening time--

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Indeed.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --in the
history of our world

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
when the two superpowers at
the time did the unthinkable

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and actually created-- they
spent the energy, the manpower,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
the resources, the technology to
create the weapons to microwave

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
the earth many times
over in the event

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.045 align:middle line:84%
that a nuclear
war ever occurred.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:49.069 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It was during
that time, George--

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine,
I found myself

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
working behind the
scenes supporting,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
writing software for the missile
program, supporting that effort

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
by day.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And by night-- ever
since I was young,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I've been a scholar of some of
our most ancient and cherished

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions
and some of the most

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:90%
mysterious texts of our past.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have felt, for a
very long time, George,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that if we knew where
to look in the past,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that we would find
the key and perhaps

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
a message from
our ancestors that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
would help us to transcend
the differences that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:84%
have led to the great
wars of the 20th

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and now the 21st century and,
at that time, the kind of war

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:90%
that I was supporting.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was during
that time that I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
began a search and a research
of comparative traditions

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
helping us to
understand our origins.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, my
thinking was if we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
could find a way to show
beyond any reasonable doubt,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
beyond the superficial,
outward demonstrations that we

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:90%
are actually-- we are one.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, it's a very
New Age-sounding hope or wish.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a lot of power

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
in showing that that
unification is possible,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
helping us to transcend
those differences.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So my journey began
to take me back

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.094 align:middle line:84%
into older and older
and older texts,

00:03:22.094 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
cutting through
the red tape and--

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were almost
obsessed with it, weren't you?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.728 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --in the religions.

00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I would say passionate.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.651 align:middle line:90%
I prefer passion over obsession.

00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
My wife would probably
say I was obsessed.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because the
clues-- every time

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I would find a clue, George, and
I'd think, OK, maybe this is it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not going
to go anywhere else,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
it would open the door
to something else.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another clue.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.356 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And open the
door to something else.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And that led me
from the textbooks

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:90%
onto a series of journeys.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.156 align:middle line:84%
My first journey was
in Egypt in 1986.

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I found in
Egypt on the temple

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
walls led me into the highlands
of the Andes Mountains

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of Southern Peru, which directed
me right into the Tibetan

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Plateau in the temples and
the monasteries in Tibet.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, my
thinking is-- I'll

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
speak about myself
personally-- if I

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
could find the information
least disturbed

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
by the modern world, that's
where it will be most intact.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.516 align:middle line:90%
And to go to those places--

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:19.141 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:90%
You had to.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.861 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --you've got to
make the effort to get there.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They're some of the most
magnificent, beautiful, remote,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
isolated, pristine places
remaining on the world.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Did I say remote, by the way?

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Because they are.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's in the monasteries
and the nunneries

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
where many of these
texts are preserved.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
largely forgotten.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing texts.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, they are.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So as I began my
search, my thinking

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
was, if we could really
pin down our origins--

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the science, the best
science of the 21st century

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
is now overturning so
many of Darwin's ideas.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Darwin
was open to that.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
He was willing for
his ideas to fall.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He viewed them as
stepping stones

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:90%
toward greater understandings.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So Darwin was OK with that.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see a connection
in the texts that was not

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
accounted for in the
theories of evolution,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.377 align:middle line:84%
and it is a connection that
is very controversial today.

00:05:20.377 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Now Darwin didn't have access
to the tools and the technology.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.889 align:middle line:84%
He certainly didn't have the DNA
databases that we have today.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have anything.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So this
is where I begin.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Part of my job in
software development

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:84%
was in writing pattern
recognition software.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.952 align:middle line:84%
And I've searched patterns
ever since I was a kid.

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
applied it to this?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It comes very naturally for me.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I used to look at
flashing patterns

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.927 align:middle line:84%
on blinking lights
on Christmas trees.

00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.676 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I mean, you know,
you see them everywhere.

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, if there
are patterns in nature

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and we are nature, they
should show up in our DNA.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the '80s
when the DNA databases,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
we could actually
begin to access them

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
without being part of
the research projects.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So to make a long
story really brief,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
what I found was in one of
the most obscure and ancient

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.804 align:middle line:84%
of the texts, a book called
"The Sefer Yetzirah."

00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It is a Hebrew
text that has only

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
been translated a couple of
times by a couple of authors

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:90%
into English.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.562 align:middle line:84%
It's so mysterious, George,
that very few scholars even

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.228 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about
it because they don't

00:06:26.228 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
know what to say about it.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a brief text.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It's only about 2,000 lines.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it is written
as if an observer were present

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.549 align:middle line:84%
the day that the Creator
created humankind step-by-step.

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: However, it's
written in a language--

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like Genesis
or totally different?

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.661 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's very
different from Genesis.

00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I think Genesis
probably partially

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
derived from this text,
"The Sefer Yetzirah," which

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:90%
is the book of creation.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It literally translates
to "the book of creation."

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.951 align:middle line:84%
So it was as if someone were
watching the Creator actually

00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:90%
create the first person.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doing what he did.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Doing what he did.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But it is not written
scientifically.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line to
what the text is saying

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
is that through language,
humankind was created.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
make a lot of sense--

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.826 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:07:18.826 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --if you
take it literally.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to
follow the instructions

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
as the author created them in
this text-- and this, George,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
to me, this is the
power of transcending

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the boundaries between
science and spirituality.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.957 align:middle line:84%
Because if a scientist only
looked at the elements of life,

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:90%
you'd never make this discovery.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
If you only look at
the spiritual text,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
you would never
make this discovery.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's by blending the
two together and allowing

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:90%
them to tell the story.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So we, today, in
modern science, we

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
talk about life as the
result of elements.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And we describe elements
through word and through number.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have the periodic
table, for example.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, carbon

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:90%
makes up the DNA of our bodies.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.346 align:middle line:90%
Those are the words.

00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And for every one
of those words,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of numbers
that may be applied.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
There are 17 different
numeric parameters

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that go with each of those.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:90%
So put that aside.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
When you go back into the
ancient text and "The Sefer

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Yetzirah" specifically, they
did exactly the same thing.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
They talked about the
power of the letters

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
of very specific alphabets.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't make a lot
of sense to modern scholars

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
until we begin to understand
that every ancient alphabet--

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
bar none that I have found so
far-- has always, from day one,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.902 align:middle line:84%
with each letter, had a number,
a mysterious number, associated

00:08:44.902 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:90%
with the letters.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
the numbers came from.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.785 align:middle line:90%
They never change.

00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A code?

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's a
unique, numeric code.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
The study of that code
is called Gematria,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:90%
and it was actually formalized.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The laws, 32 laws,
of Gematria were

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
formed in the second century.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They were formalized
in the second century.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And the only way Gematria works
is you cannot deviate from

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:90%
these laws.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
There are specific laws
that apply to the numbers.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So our ancestors were
also talking about life

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:90%
using words and numbers.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So they had the letters
of the alphabets

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and this mysterious number.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.757 align:middle line:90%
We're using the periodic table.

00:09:21.757 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
We got a whole bunch of numbers.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: My job was to find
out which of those numbers

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
equates to the numbers
in the ancient alphabets.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I could do
that, my thinking was,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it would be possible to look
at human DNA-- carbon, oxygen,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:84%
hydrogen, nitrogen and
different combinations of that--

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and substitute the ancient
letters for the numbers

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:90%
based upon this correlation.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
This, in retrospect,
it was simple.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But not knowing
that, it took years.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It took me 12 years--

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And did you break it?

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --to find
what we now know

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the atomic mass of
the elements, the numbers

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic mass
are the numbers that

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
equate to the mysterious letters
in the ancient alphabets.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
What that means is when you
look at human DNA or the DNA

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of any life, it is made of
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:90%
carbon.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And using Gematria, the
numbers that equate to those

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.969 align:middle line:84%
become one, five,
six, and three.

00:10:23.969 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Three is with the carbon.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you then take a table,
one of the ancient tables,

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to
correlate those numbers

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.692 align:middle line:84%
with the letters, what we find,
George, is that human DNA is--

00:10:35.692 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A match?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Our genome
is built in layers.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the top layer-- it's like
every book has an introduction.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The introduction in
every cell of every form

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
of life, carbon-based DNA,
the introduction is the same.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And the first
translation literally

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
reads-- literal-- "God
eternal within the body."

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
God eternal within the body.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And God that is
depicted in the DNA

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is actually spelled the
way that the name of God

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
was spelled in the
ancient text before it

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:90%
was removed 6,800 times.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Torah, for example, the
sacred name of God is believed

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to be so sacred it cannot
be written in its entirety.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why put it in a code?

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know,
this was-- so first,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, what
I have to say is this.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.767 align:middle line:84%
People say, why
is the code there?

00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I
say, I don't know.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that when
I follow the instructions

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.614 align:middle line:84%
in a 3,000-year-old text and I
applied to the periodic table--

00:11:41.614 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.904 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --this
is what we have.

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.602 align:middle line:90%
Next question, is a coincidence?

00:11:45.602 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
no coincidences!

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.643 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:11:47.643 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, I
had a statistician

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
run the numbers for me.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:55.945 align:middle line:84%
And the odds of this happening
by chance are 1 to 234,256.

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:02.325 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: 234,256
to 1, or 0.00041%--

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --those are
the odds that it's--

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just random.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --just random.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Now those aren't
astronomical odds.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought it might be
like one to a bajillion.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.764 align:middle line:90%
But when you take into account--

00:12:14.764 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're still high.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Not only is
the language there,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:84%
but when you take into
account what the words say,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that those words
actually have meaning,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.299 align:middle line:90%
"God eternal within the body."

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they all say that?

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The first
letter in all human DNA,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.814 align:middle line:84%
if you can look at what's
called the genetic code, CTAG,

00:12:36.814 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
every one of those is made up of
combinations of carbon, oxygen,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen, nitrogen.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.224 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And they
are arranged--

00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
really technical when

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this,
but they're arranged

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
different numbers of carbon,
oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:90%
atoms.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So within each of the DNA bases
that make our DNA as it is,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.815 align:middle line:84%
they're different combinations
of CTAG that breakdown

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
to different combinations of
"God eternal within the body."

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the God within
ourselves, within our DNA,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is literally the same
spelling of the God

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.404 align:middle line:90%
that was taken from those texts.

00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the beauty.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I just have to say this.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.191 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: My first
fear was I found it

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Hebrew language.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, does that
mean-- could it actually

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
be divisive if it only
is found in one language?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And when the research went to
its fruition, what we found

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is it is in Hebrew and
Aramaic and Sanskrit,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
three of the root languages.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same thing?

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Exactly
the same thing.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So in Hebrew,
Aramaic, and Sanskrit,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
the code for those letters
translates precisely the same

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:90%
in the human DNA.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the first layer.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
opinion, that slogan,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
"God eternal is in the
body," what did that mean?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What it tells me
is because the odds of that

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.524 align:middle line:90%
happening by chance are--

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astronomical.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --are steep.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It tells me there's
an intentionality.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Now who or what, I don't
know the answer to that.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But it tells me that the
DNA, the way it's formed,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is intentional.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to think,
in our modern world,

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:90%
we're creators.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We're artists.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we create something
that we're proud of, when we're

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.652 align:middle line:84%
finished, what's
the last thing we

00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
do when we finish it, George?

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the last thing
we do with something?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
We finish a painting,
and what's the last thing

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
we do when we finish
that painting?

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.404 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sign it.

00:14:38.404 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We put our name on it.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
If there's an intentionality
underlying life itself

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and human life specifically,
it would make tremendous sense

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to me that who or
whoever is responsible

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%
would somehow have left a sign.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God's signature?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I believe that
however we define that, whoever

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we
believe that Creator

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is, my next question is,
why not put it into a text?

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Or into a temple wall?

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, my thinking was,
why place that signature

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
into something that can crumble
over a few thousand years

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
like a temple wall?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Or into the pages of a
book that can be destroyed?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.862 align:middle line:84%
Why not put it in
the creation itself?

00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the
creation exists,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:90%
the message exists as well.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I publish this in 2004.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though the
research was incomplete,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:90%
it was complete to that point.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share
this with the world.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.965 align:middle line:84%
2007, Japanese scientists
released a report,

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
a peer reviewed report, on the
feasibility of storing data

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:90%
in DNA for thousands of years.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
looking at is bacteria.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at storing
information in bacteria

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and placing the bacteria
in nuclear waste dumps,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And letting
it sit there.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And
letting it sit there.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the papers might
disintegrate or something else

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:90%
might happen.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:90%
But if they could do it.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So 2007 was the first
time they successfully

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
implanted a message into
the DNA of a bacteria.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.077 align:middle line:90%
And they used bacteria because--

00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hoping that someone
in the future one day

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.847 align:middle line:90%
would use it?

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, this was a test.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:84%
They used the bacteria because
they have a short lifespan,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
so they can see how
many generations.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it take.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know,
for a bacteria,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.747 align:middle line:84%
the generations may
be just a few days.

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.242 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The code they
put into the DNA, it was--

00:16:26.242 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't say it
was the same thing.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.491 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: No.

00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It was Einstein's theory.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It was E equals mc
squared in the year 1905.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:90%
They encoded that into the DNA.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.221 align:middle line:84%
They allowed the DNA to
replicate for 25 generations.

00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With that code.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: With the code.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:90%
They pulled the code right out.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bizarre.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.286 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Completely intact.

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So what they're
now demonstrating

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:84%
purely in the scientific
realm is the feasibility

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of storing literal information
in the genome, in the DNA.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And it remains
intact for as long

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:90%
as the organism remains intact.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, here's
the puzzling part.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
If you put a code
in there, you're

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:84%
doing it for one
of several reasons.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:90%
One, you're hiding it.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Or two, you're trying
to pass information

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:90%
on to some future generation.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that
that's what that is.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we extract it
and we get that code, what

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.921 align:middle line:90%
do we do with it?

00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.794 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think it depends
on what the code says.

00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, we know.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And the work is progressing
from this point.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.057 align:middle line:84%
And in 2015, another layer will
have been completely decoded.

00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:38.265 align:middle line:84%
Then hopefully, you and I
can have this conversation,

00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and I'll share
what we find next.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The point is that there
is a message encoded

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
into the DNA of all
human life that tells us

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
beyond any reasonable doubt that
the differences that divide us

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
now are superficial
differences and that we

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.235 align:middle line:84%
have a common origin,
a common ancestry.

00:17:57.235 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a conference
in the DC area,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:90%
and I made the statement.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I would love
to get my hands on some DNA

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
from life that's
not from this world.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And if it's carbon-based
life, and if the message is

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:90%
the same--

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --then we know
that we have a common--

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.708 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A common goal.

00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --a common goal.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
that be exciting?

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, there's a man
that came forward and said,

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.335 align:middle line:84%
when you're ready for
that DNA, let me know.

00:18:24.335 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's got it?

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I don't know.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe from some
Martian meteorite, right?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I don't know.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, we don't know.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You going
to take him up on it?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm going to call
him from your cellphone number,

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
George, not from my
cell phone number.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.176 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thanks.

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Block your number.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm not
ready for that yet.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
When we were developing
the algorithms--

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and there are very
complex algorithms now

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to help look at the
DNA in new ways.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:90%
We come full circle.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
We are at this crisis
point in civilization

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.024 align:middle line:84%
when we're facing more crises
of such great magnitude.

00:18:59.024 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Than ever before
that I can remember.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --based on our
division, on our separation.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And if there is some way
that we could bring forward

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
in a really powerful
meaningful way something that

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
casts an entire new
light on us as a family

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and what that family
means, I think

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
it would give us a reason to
look at things differently.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.412 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it
would force us to.

00:19:24.412 --> 00:19:25.036 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:25.036 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It means it would
give us a scientific reason

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to look at one another and think
of ourselves very differently.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I know for myself,
once I found this code,

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt differently about myself
knowing that within every cell

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
of my body, God eternal-- it's
Y-H-V-G, the Hebrew letters.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Y-H, yah, is actually one of
the forms of the name of God

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the Torah that
was removed over 6,800 times.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it baffle you
as to who put the code there?

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I've sensed that
there's an intentionality.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Regarding us.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we go to look, now,
at Darwin's idea of evolution,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago we
appeared on this Earth.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
where we came from.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And what made us different
from so many of the other forms

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of life was human
chromosome number two,

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
the largest that had
been infused with two

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
telomere-to-telomere fusions.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Geneticists
acknowledged the fusion.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.062 align:middle line:84%
They say, we can't
say how it happened.

00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
know it happened.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it did not happen
under natural circumstances.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
They said this would
not happen in nature.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Something has forced
this chromosome

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
or this telomere-to-telomere
fusion between these two

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:90%
chromosomes.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we're
getting, George,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
is we've had a sense,
so many people,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that there's much more
to us than evolution

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:90%
has led us to believe.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
evolution didn't occur.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist I can
say it did to a point,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
but there's a point where
evolution does not explain

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
our existence and cannot
account for what we find.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think this study,
this kind of work

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
where we're crossing the
traditional boundaries

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
between science
and spirituality--

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
a scholar studying the
text would never find this.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A scientist would?

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: A scientist
looking at the elements

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
in the periodic
table or a geneticist

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.327 align:middle line:84%
would never find it because
they're compartmentalized.

00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need a combination.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.576 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But the world
doesn't work that way.

00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So we are gifting
ourselves the ability

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
to see the world as it
is through what the world

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
a sharing with us if
we're open enough.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:90%
But the science has to be rigid.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to be based upon
what science is telling us.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So the periodic table
describes the elements that

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:90%
make the DNA in our bodies.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a mathematic
link between that

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and the letters of
the ancient alphabets.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:84%
How that link got there, who
put it there, I have no idea.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As I was flying
here, Greg, from Los Angeles

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to Denver-- and I'm
looking around the plane.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.705 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these
people sitting on the plane.

00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And it just dawns on me-- and
I do this a lot-- every one

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:90%
of them is an individual.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
They've got their own little
situation, their problems,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
their happiness, their families.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Every one of them.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But the question I
kept asking myself

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:84%
as I looked at this entire
plane full of people, why?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
What's the reason?

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:90%
What are they here for?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Some had briefcases.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Some had purses.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Some had tablets.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:90%
I still can't get that answer.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You, of course, have
brought up a series

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of six questions in one
of our previous shows

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:90%
that asks those questions too.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But will we ever
get that answer?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think we will
have the answer, George.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will
we be willing to accept

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
what the answer says to us.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it frightening?

00:22:56.735 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I don't
think it's frightening.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
We've asked science
to tell us who we are.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they don't tell us.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
science, pure science,

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is now revealing
the information.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not being accepted
in the mainstream.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So the textbooks
in the classrooms

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.229 align:middle line:84%
are not accepting what
the science is telling us.

00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it telling us?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: For
example, evolution--

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
we'll just take
evolution because that's

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of people's
minds right now.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
In the public
classroom, a teacher

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
can only teach the
curricula that's

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:90%
been approved by a school board.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: All right.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:90%
The school board--

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
deviate from that.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: If the school
board does not accept--

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
even though it's peer
reviewed science--

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
if the school board
does not accept that,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:90%
it cannot be taught.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or that
teacher gets fired.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So we're
teaching our young people--

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:90%
or the teacher gets fired, yeah.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching our
young people the story

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
of separation that has led
to so many of the crises

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.495 align:middle line:84%
It makes us feel
separate from ourselves.

00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:50.078 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:50.078 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: From one another.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked professors
and friends of mine.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, why can't you share
this in the classroom?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.304 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you
share this science?

00:24:00.304 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're petrified
to share this, aren't they?

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.947 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are four--
money, ego, power, and habit.

00:24:05.947 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.988 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And one of those,
one of the professors, he said,

00:24:08.988 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
do you know-- he's a male--
he said, do you know what that

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:16.152 align:middle line:84%
would mean to my 40-year career
if I had to stand in front

00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of a classroom say,
everything I've

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
taught until this point
is no longer true?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So to him, it would
say he was a failure.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
What I said to him,
I said, it would

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
be a beautiful demonstration
of the power of science

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to
constantly update what science

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:90%
is telling us about our world.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.803 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you know
how much money it would

00:24:34.803 --> 00:24:36.057 align:middle line:90%
cost to change the textbooks?

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know,
look how much money we

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:90%
spend a war, so why not?

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Habit.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, it is
a habit to teach this.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Now it is changing.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing
slowly, George.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is only one place.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is only one place.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's the place that's
directly relevant to the God

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But will we
get that answer, Gregg?

00:24:56.603 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think we
will find the evidence

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:90%
of the circumstances.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:84%
The actual reason, I
think, is something

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
find for ourselves.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.304 align:middle line:90%
I think we're--

00:25:12.304 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Individually?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.178 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Individually.

00:25:14.178 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
we're going find.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.632 align:middle line:84%
A good friend of
mine was watching

00:25:17.632 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:90%
the movie "The Matrix."

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of our
viewers have seen it.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great movie.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I've cited that on
the radio show a lot.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I love it as well.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.874 align:middle line:90%
It's one that I have by the TV.

00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm writing into
the wee hours the morning,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.307 align:middle line:90%
there's two movies.

00:25:29.307 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't watch them all the
way through, but I'll--

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Contact" and "Matrix."

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: You know.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:90%
How'd you know that?

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it's
the same with me.

00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I don't watch
them all the way through.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But I like the part where
they solve the codes because I

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:90%
think there's a lot to that.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know, where does
that come from anyway?

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.583 align:middle line:84%
So my friend said, you
think it's science fiction.

00:25:44.583 --> 00:25:47.527 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Matrix" is actually
a documentary about us--

00:25:47.527 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.151 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --and the way
things work in the world.

00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that by working
backward through the code,

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
we do arrive at the doorstep
of an architect at some point.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could get
an answer to one question,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.262 align:middle line:90%
what would that question be?

00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think
it's the question

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.170 align:middle line:90%
we're asking right now.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Why us?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Why here?

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
There's another branch of
work that this follows up on,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and it is the study
of whether or not

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
we are living in a simulation
or a virtual reality.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.322 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
degreed course in one

00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
of the large eastern
universities--

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.453 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --in philosophy
that you can take.

00:26:29.453 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And the title of the course is
"Are We Living a Simulation?"

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story very
brief, what they did was they

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.320 align:middle line:84%
took a very complex
computer algorithm,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
plugged in all
kinds of variables

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
about human population
and trajectories

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and economies and families
and religious beliefs--

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:90%
all about life.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is there's
over a 93% chance that we

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:90%
are living a simulation.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Now if you step
into a simulation,

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.514 align:middle line:84%
a virtual environment,
in Disneyland,

00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
you can do that
today and not even

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
really know that
that's where you are.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've only had
computers about 60 years.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
archaeology that's

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:84%
showing the existence of
advanced technological

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
civilizations
thousands of years,

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
where would we be
if we had thousands

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.595 align:middle line:84%
of years of computer science to
build that kind of simulation?

00:27:19.595 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And the question
comes, why would we do this?

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answer for me
is that every simulation

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is built to help the people
in the simulation become very

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
well-adapted to
somewhere that they're

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
going to be when the
simulation no longer exists.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The simulation's a safe place
to make mistakes and learn

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that power if we are in fact,
on Earth, living a simulation.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And our most
cherished traditions

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.307 align:middle line:84%
tell us that we're on
our way somewhere else.

00:27:49.307 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:90%
This isn't it.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.723 align:middle line:90%
This is an illusion.

00:27:50.723 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:90%
This is temporary.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.824 align:middle line:90%
In general, they say that.

00:27:53.824 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Then, I think we have to look
at what those traditions are

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:90%
telling us.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're teaching us
about our relationship

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to reality, to quantum reality,
to emotions and emotions

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.095 align:middle line:90%
of the heart, to create--

00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --and heal in our
bodies and the world around us.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And if we master
those, maybe that's

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:84%
what this simulation
is all about.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
God eternal within
the body, may be

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the architect that has helped
to create this simulation.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.799 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
ever get frustrated

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.256 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
the answers yet?

00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I don't, George.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Because what it tells
me is-- and what

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I've come to
understand-- is that when

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
we are truly ready for that
information, it's right there.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.840 align:middle line:90%
This is a perfect example.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
This has been around
for 200,000 years.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:90%
It's only when--

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Only to be discovered,
though, by those who look.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Or when our technology
reaches the point that it gives

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.415 align:middle line:90%
us the tools--

00:28:51.415 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --to take a peek.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like that code

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:84%
we sent out on one
of the Viking craft.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I know.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which Stephen
Hawking said, don't do!

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Because he's afraid
that they'll come here.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.446 align:middle line:84%
And he's not so sure
they're very benevolent.

00:29:05.446 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually talk about that code
in the book "The God Code."

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:90%
What is it that we said?

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.547 align:middle line:90%
Who did we write it to?

00:29:13.547 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who finds it?

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.379 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And how would
it be interpreted?

00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So it makes
perfect sense to me.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
If we are the product
of intentional creation,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Creator, who
or whatever that is,

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:84%
would somehow leave
a mark letting

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.399 align:middle line:84%
us know when we have the
ability to find that.

00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is brilliant.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I can't think of
a more honoring way to honor who

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:84%
or what that Creator is
than to take that code,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
read it, and maybe communicate
back the other way.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.479 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are on
our way to doing that.

00:29:44.479 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: You know, as we've

Who are we?

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I wonder, maybe
we won't get that answer.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But we'll continue
striving for it.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that'll
make us a better person.
