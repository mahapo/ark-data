00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: She's
a mystic healer.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Her name is Sonja
Grace, and she is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
our guest on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>She is a mystic and healer who
provides long-distance relief

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
For the past 30
years, Sonja Grace

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
has used her ability to
communicate with the divine

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
to help family members to
speak to loved ones who

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
have crossed over.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
She has cleared karmic threads
to past lives and much more.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
In her forthcoming
book "Spirit Traveler,"

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Sonja takes readers
along on her journeys

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to ancient sites like
Stonehenge and the Pyramids.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
She shares the sights, sounds,
and smells of the places

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
she visits, unlocking ancient
mysteries that continue

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:90%
to bedevil researchers.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've got my
copy of "Spirit Traveler."

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Did you sign it over to me yet?

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SONJA GRACE: No, not yet.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're going
to have to do that.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Hi.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My pleasure.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Thank you.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.778 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Well "Spirit
Traveler" is coming out,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:10%
and I'm excited about this
book, because it really takes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:10%
a look at what happened back
in history when most people are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:10%
speculating and archaeologists
have scratched their heads

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:10%
and said, hmm.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Why was this built?

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it a
different time then

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
where people seemed to
be much more involved

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.687 align:middle line:84%
in mystical things and
metaphysical things?

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know
what it was, George?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:90%
People were closer to the Earth.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The people back then
in 8,000, 10,000 BC,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
they were connected
to the Earth in ways

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that we see indigenous
people today

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:84%
still practicing ceremonies
and having that connection.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the energy of the
Earth back then was so strong.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It was not muddled by pollution
and all the technology

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.997 align:middle line:90%
we have now.

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's interesting.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I've always used
some-- interesting

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that we work with Gaia here,
the Gaia television network.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But the Gaia theory that
the planet is alive,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that it's a living organism
all by itself I think

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to hold more
and more water, don't you?

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:84%
These places that I
visited in my book,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
they have sites that are portals
that literally opened up,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and energy coming from
the cosmos, energy

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
coming from the Earth.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And the people knew that.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:90%
They understood it.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
They knew that
our whole survival

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
was based on connecting with
that energy of the planet.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got to tell you,
I love stories about portals.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm nuts about them.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Do people sometimes
stumble into portals

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and they don't come out?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
they're gone, right?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is what took place.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what was so
incredible about huge groups

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:90%
of people just disappearing.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Was it some kind of
a weather anomaly?

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.522 align:middle line:90%
Was it starvation?

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had David
Paulides on my radio show.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.470 align:middle line:90%
He's written a book.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Missing
411" about people

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
all around this planet
who just simply vanished.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
They disappear.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling us
a story about a couple.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They were out with their little
child in, like, a little woods,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
walking along a path.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Little kid was
right behind them.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Right behind them.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
He may have veered off
just by a few feet.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:90%
They turn around and he's gone.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%
They can't find him.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.439 align:middle line:90%
They still can't find him.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be one of the
most horrible feelings.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into
these other portals,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.663 align:middle line:90%
what do you come out to?

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:03.463 align:middle line:90%
What's there?

00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, back when
these portals opened-- and I'm

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.055 align:middle line:84%
talking at the end of
the Ice Age, 10,000 BC,

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
these huge portals opened
all over the world,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
and it was the beginning
of a new phase of humanity.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So as these portals
opened up, it

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
was like a giant signal,
kind of like Batman

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and the light in the
sky with a bat on it.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It was like a signal
to the cosmos.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
We're starting a new
phase of humanity.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
all the star beings

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
or what I call
demigods came through,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.297 align:middle line:84%
and they helped create and mold
societies all over the world.

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a mystic healer.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that means.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Well, I'm a mystic.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm connected to hearing,
seeing, smelling, feeling,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
being completely hardwired
to everything that's unseen.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a healer,
and I work very much

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
primarily long distance with
people all over the world.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to put myself in front
of them wherever they are.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I say it's
defying time and space.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a time traveler too.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But when I work on people, I
put myself in front of them.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the same
relationship to time and space

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.129 align:middle line:90%
that most people do.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
people want from you

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
when they ask you things,
when they call you,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:90%
when they need help?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: A lot of people want to
have solutions to the problems

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:90%
that they're dealing with.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I do a lot of processing
and inner child work

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to help people get at the
core wounds, everything that's

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
been bottled up for years
that they haven't really

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
come to terms with.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people want
healing, and I'll

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
go in and work on
livers and hearts

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.725 align:middle line:84%
and repair tissue
and work on cancers.

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't have
to physically touch them.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, I don't.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman in Puerto Rico
who had a lesion on her liver,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and I worked on her.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And basically, did all of
my energy work on that.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:10%
And the next three days
later, she had a test done,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:10%
and the lesion was gone.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: People with heart
disease, they've gone back,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:10%
there's no heart disease.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.645 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It doesn't surprise
you anymore, does it?

00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:17.478 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It doesn't.

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
it for so long now,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like a
doctor sometimes,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because people call me for
everything under the sun.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I've worked on everything.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Now John of God
in Brazil actually

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:90%
has to touch people, right?

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or he will literally
reach into part of your stomach

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and he'll pull
that tumor, right?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Without an incision.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
How does he do that?

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know, I have a
lot of respect for John of God.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
who go to John of God

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
come to me as well,
because they weren't

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
able to go back to Brazil
and have a follow-up.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.845 align:middle line:90%
It's not that easy to do that.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, no.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I prefer
to work long distance,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like I have
a better sort of buffer

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:90%
between me and the client.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I have a better ability to
almost keep a protection

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:84%
around me, because
there's a lot of things

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that people come in with.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I do clear entities and
aliens and alien probes,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's intense.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:90%
My work is very intense.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And I feel blessed
to have this ability,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.092 align:middle line:90%
but I don't wish it on anyone.

00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:27.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep away from
these alien probes.

00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Definitely.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the book
the "Spirit Traveler,"

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
who's the spirit traveler?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it you--

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Me.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's you.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the book.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I'm able, like
I said, to go into meditation.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.285 align:middle line:90%
And it's not astral projection.

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like my whole
being dissolves.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like I dissolve.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not there anymore.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And my guides take me.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I never travel
anywhere without them.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
And they take me to the site.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
When we get there, a lot of
times we're back in time.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So the first time my spirit
traveled to Stonehenge, there

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
were no stones.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It was just this bare
landscape of Salisbury Plain.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And they showed
me the progression

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of how stones and branches and
different ornaments, and then

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
the wooden henge, and then
the large sarsen stones

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
were placed over time.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.042 align:middle line:84%
It was really great to see
that kind of progression.

00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
a look at one of the places

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:90%
you have visited.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:10%
>>Stonehenge is the most
important prehistoric monument

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:10%
in Europe, perhaps
the whole world.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:10%
Its impressive design and
meticulous construction

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:10%
are unmatched anywhere.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Located in southwest
England, its stone circles

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
were made from 160
enormous megaliths, some

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
weighing over 50
tons, and measuring

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
over six meters in height.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
The sheer magnitude of
a structure so ancient

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.132 align:middle line:90%
defies belief.

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
does defy belief.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
How in the heck
could ancient people,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
without high technology--
we don't think

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they had it-- and equipment
move stone like that?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: What I
found when I spirit

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
traveled there was
these beings came to me.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
They called themselves
the ancient ones,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:90%
but they were Pleiadians.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were part
of the star beings

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:90%
that came through these portals.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
We have all kinds of demigods.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We have Ra and
Sekhmet and Hathor,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and we have all of the
Greek gods, the Hindu gods,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:90%
the Norse gods, Thor and Odin.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians were
a part of that.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
They came through and helped
to create this new phase

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
of humanity in the UK.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.872 align:middle line:84%
And there's over 1,000
stone circles in that area.

00:09:52.872 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do we do?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Well, they're portals.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:10%
Here we are, back to portals.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They're marked because
they're energy portals.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And the thing
about these portals

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is some of them receive
cosmic energy, some of them

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
release energy from the Earth,
and some of them are both.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you would
stand in the middle,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
would you feel something?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of
vibration or anything?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It depends
if it's still open.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We traveled
physically to England,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and went to all these
different stone circles,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and found that some of them
are still very activated,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and some of them, the
energy's kind of been robbed,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're closed
down a little bit.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So at Stonehenge, I definitely
felt a lot of things there.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It was very powerful.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But Stonehenge originally was
created for fertility rites.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It was about these
ancient ones procreating

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
with the high
priestesses and creating

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:90%
a new race of humanity.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about
death rituals, which

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is what a lot of
archaeologists and scientists

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
surmised because of
the burial mounds.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't need 160
huge stones for that, do you?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But because of the burial
mounds so close to the site,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
they assumed it was for
some kind of death ritual.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
For fertility, I think you
needed this huge structure,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
not because it was
standing when they

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
did the fertility ceremonies.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:84%
They placed those stones
to remind the people,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
this is our last
statement to humanity.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
This is so you will remember
us and always remember

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
the ceremonies
that we taught you.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet we've
lost that knowledge.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: We have--

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: --which
is why they started

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
burying people near the site,
because they were scrambling.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Once they stopped
coming and visiting them

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
during the solstice
and the equinox,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
then the people started
to get frantic and panic,

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and they started burying
their high priestesses

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and their elite
next to the site,

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
hoping that they
would reach the gods.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what's
amazing about all of this

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it happened,
and it happened a long time

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
They had a reason for why
they did these things.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And they all seemed to have
lost the knowledge of why they

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
were there in the first place.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:90%

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Pyramids,
Stonehenge, all of them.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.395 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: And what was
remaining after, you know,

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:10%
war and pillaging, and
all this stuff went on

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:10%
is what the Druids picked up.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:10%
And the Druids then started
reenacting the old ceremonies

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient ones.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Druids tried to
carry on the practice,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.983 align:middle line:84%
but it went from the goddess,
the feminine principle,

00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the high priestess to then
more of a male-oriented--

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought the
Druids were somewhat evil.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Not so?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.411 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, I don't think
they were evil at all.

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think Merlin
had a lot to do

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
with the evolution
of the Druids.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%

really a Merlin?

>>GRACE: Yes, there was.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was much earlier
in time than what

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
we have perceived
through, again, history,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and how history
said, oh, it must

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:90%
have happened during this time.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have smartphones.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have the internet.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
They had to do something
to keep occupied.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So did they just
build these structures

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:84%
just because they
had nothing to do?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a reason for that?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: No, I feel that
Avebury circle, for example,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:10%
was a hospital.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a place
where everybody went

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to get doctored and healed.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And because they were
so tuned in to the Earth

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and they were so tuned
into the cosmos-- thus,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.075 align:middle line:84%
none of the phones
and everything else--

00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
be transported.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier about
people just disappearing.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened in Avebury.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:10%
They would stand in
one of three circles

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:10%
within that large--
the large circle,

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:10%
and they would go
to various places.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:10%
It was aligned with Orion, the
same as the Great Pyramids.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And they would go to one
of these three places,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
the illness was.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth circle
within the large circle,

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
a high priestess would stand and
designate what your illness was

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and where you needed to go.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So they were told, OK.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Go stand over there,
and you will get healed.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
There were pits, these
healing pits in those circles.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So it looked much different
than it does today.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And the stones that mark the
whole outer circle simply

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:90%
defines how big that portal was.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people were there?

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
How many sick people
went to these places?

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I'm
sure there were enough.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people--

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they have the same
illnesses that we have today?

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.833 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, I think they
had different illnesses.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we know through
history that at least starting

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
in probably 500
AD, we had a series

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of plagues and black plague
and all of these illnesses

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that wiped out entire
groups of people.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure back in
those times, there

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:84%
were illnesses that were
very life-threatening.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
concocted these things

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.001 align:middle line:84%
and came up with these plans
to heal people this way?

00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: These were
the star beings.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.333 align:middle line:84%
These were the ancient
ones, the Pleiadians.

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ETs that
came here and taught them.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.435 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And they did this
all over the world.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
at the Great Pyramids,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
this is what
happened to Tiwanaku,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
this is what
happened down south,

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Chichen Itza, all
these different sites.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So these sites,
if I'm reading you right,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
collect and draw energy from
the universe, from the planet,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and you direct it to heal
and to do other things.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happens?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: These sites
are open portals that

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:90%
receive and transmit energy.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And from that
reception of energies,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:84%
people were able
to utilize and were

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
directed by the Pleiadians,
or whoever was there,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to know what to do with
that particular site.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.395 align:middle line:84%
At Stonehenge and Avebury
circle, it was the Pleiadians.

00:16:58.395 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, different groups
influenced different parts

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Highclere Castle.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: That's in England.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right outside of London.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's take you there right now.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:10%
>>70 miles west
of London lies one

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:10%
of the great estates of England,
Highclere, a country house

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:10%
nestling in 5,000 acres.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:84%
That's five times the size
of New York's Central Park.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Highclere is the
location backdrop

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
for the successful television
period drama "Downton Abbey,"

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And walking through its
doors is like walking

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.762 align:middle line:90%
onto the television set.

00:17:40.762 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
In reality, this is a 19th
century trophy house, designed

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.911 align:middle line:90%
to show off inherited wealth.

00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:56.647 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.647 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he's not kidding
about inherited wealth, is he?

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.351 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's an amazing place.

00:18:02.351 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
When I spirit
traveled there, there

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.664 align:middle line:90%
was just a barrage of ghosts.

00:18:05.664 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
feel them, see them--

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Oh, I could see
them, totally see them.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Old maids and stewards and
people who had worked there.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
all happy ghosts?

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know, I
wouldn't say they're happy.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I think some were a
little disgruntled.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think most
ghosts remain here

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
because they feel they
didn't finish something.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They didn't complete
something they needed to do.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
there busy working,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and you know, it's busy.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a very busy house.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.332 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a haunted place?

00:18:34.332 --> 00:18:35.915 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I think
it's totally haunted.

00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:36.748 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: But the main
people who are there

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:10%
is George and Almina, the
owners, the original owners.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
George and Almina
Herbert were-- he was

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:90%
the fifth Earl of Carnarvon.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And he is the one who
worked with Howard Carter

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and went to Egypt and
discovered King Tut's tomb.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, wasn't
there a curse when

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.552 align:middle line:90%
they opened up King Tut's tomb?

00:19:01.552 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And he was the
one who died from this.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, they say
today it was a mosquito bite

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and he died from--

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zika
virus or something.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, malaria.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I found when
I spirit traveled there

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and then I went there
physically and visited the site,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
is these people are held there.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not able to go.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they want to go?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know, I think
they would if they could.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want to move on.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: But down in
the basement of this

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.978 align:middle line:84%
huge castle is all these
artifacts, Egyptian artifacts.

00:19:29.978 --> 00:19:31.436 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That place
has a basement?

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:35.605 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It has a huge,
huge underground space.

00:19:35.605 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's got a leak.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Huge.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And they went to Egypt before
he went with Howard Carter,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and they basically
took things-- we

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
use the word robbed--
but they took things

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.532 align:middle line:90%
from the valley of the dead.

00:19:50.532 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I was standing in
the basement, Hatshepsut --

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:90%
you know who she is.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
She was the pharaoh,
the female pharaoh.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They took
stuff from her?

00:19:58.206 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They took the papyrus
from the "Book of the Dead."

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And she stood there right
in front of me and said,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.850 align:middle line:90%
I want my stuff back.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.916 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where part
of the curse has come in.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
desecrate those areas.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happened.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
These people are being held
because they have these things

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:90%
that don't belong to them.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a spirit traveler,
can you get into trouble.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you get stuck
in an area that you

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be traveling?

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I can.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very careful to never
go anywhere without my guides.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.898 align:middle line:84%
My guides are the ones that take
me and move me through time.

00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:42.356 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You trust
them, obviously.

00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:43.189 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:20:43.189 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And you could call it time
travel because I do end up

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in a different time period.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But I don't go
anywhere without them.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.515 align:middle line:84%
They navigate where I'm going
and how I'm getting there.

00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that I work with

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.585 align:middle line:84%
and that I talked about in my
book, "Become an Earth Angel."

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
this one right here.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's the fifth
dimension that we're in now.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in the fifth dimension.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
We moved out of the fourth
dimension into the fifth.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And then there's energy
called the realms.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And those are two
different things.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Our whole galaxy is in
the fifth dimension.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's this higher
frequency, higher vibration,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
but the realms are different
energies that we can exist in.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of Earth and people
are in the second realm.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Some people have moved
into the third realm.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:90%
They're a little calmer.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.119 align:middle line:10%
They like to communicate more.

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where would
we be right about now?

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: In the third realm.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Third.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And High, really evolved beings
move into the fourth realm.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Fifth realm, sixth
realm, seventh realm,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that's where you're going
to find a lot of ETs.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.739 align:middle line:84%
That's where a lot of the
extraterrestrials exist.

00:21:53.739 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
your spirit guides.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These ETs?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:90%
No, my spirit guides are angels.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And I work--

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many do you have?

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I work
only with angels.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
There's about five of them.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five spirit guides.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:90%
All at the same time?

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them since
I was-- my earliest

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:90%
memory was two years old.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they all
have separate duties?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They've been with
me through all my lifetimes.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do they have
different responsibilities?

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.569 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, they do.

00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, like
one takes care of you

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:90%
from getting into an accident.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
One takes care of you
from health purposes.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Are they like that?

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They work
more as a group.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They work more
together on things.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
There are certain ones that will
help me with certain things.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
we travel as a group,

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and they make sure all
of my traveling is safe.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little bit
about Skellig Michael Island.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And I want to look at a video.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.870 align:middle line:90%
What is that place?

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's an island off
the west coast of Ireland,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's a place where
monks used to live back

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
in the 500 AD time period.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's he what's so special
about Skellig Michael Island.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:10%
>>Over 1,400 years ago,
a small group of men

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:10%
were searching for a place
to practice their religion

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:10%
in solitude and isolation.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It was barely 500 years
since the death of Christ,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and these remarkable men
ventured into the open ocean

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.785 align:middle line:84%
off southwest
Ireland, determined

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:25.023 align:middle line:84%
to build monastery on one of
the most extraordinary locations

00:23:25.023 --> 00:23:25.823 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:23:25.823 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The Skellig Islands
are two massive rocks

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.225 align:middle line:84%
lying 12 kilometers out
into the Atlantic Ocean,

00:23:36.225 --> 00:23:40.876 align:middle line:84%
and 1,400 years ago, they sat
on the very edge of the known

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:41.676 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:23:41.676 --> 00:23:45.127 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.127 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the two islands lay
the void of an open ocean,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.439 align:middle line:90%
seemingly without end.

00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:58.103 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
For their citadel, the
monks chose the larger

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.724 align:middle line:84%
of the two islands,
Skellig Michael,

00:24:04.724 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and began building
a retreat that

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:84%
remains to this day one of
the most remarkable testaments

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:90%
to human faith on Earth.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, I'm
amazed at how they're

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
able to take what could be
something like a barren island

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into, like
they said, a retreat.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know,
the construction

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:90%
of those sites there are crazy.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The monks built
these beehive huts

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:90%
that look like little beehives.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:90%
No mortar, only stone.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of the stairways
that come up from the ocean

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:90%
are with no mortar.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
They're just stones placed
exactly so that-- and years,

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:90%
obviously--

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And built from stones
on the island I guess, right?

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
What did they do
about eating and food?

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They grew food.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
They ate the eggs of
the birds on the island.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was minimal.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:90%
It was sparse.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about that
island that's so amazing

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:08.959 align:middle line:84%
is it's got this electromagnetic
energy that is phenomenal.

00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'd go out
of my mind there.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.694 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I would
love to go there.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really--

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but for
the rest of your life?

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's the top of a mountain.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And during the time of
Lemuria, that mountain

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:90%
was a sacred mountain.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
That whole land--
there was no ocean

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:90%
between Ireland and Skellig.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:90%
It was all land.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And the land connected
all the way to Greenland.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was a much
different landscape

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:90%
at the end of Lemuria.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
oceans came, of course,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
500 AD, the monks
that settled there,

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
they were raided by
Vikings constantly.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:90%
They had a hard time surviving.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was the mythical
group, the Tuatha de Danann

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that were there on the
island before the monks.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones, when
I spirit traveled there,

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that told me about the
energy of that island

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful
it really is, which

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is why the monks
wanted to be there.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
are like you that carry

00:26:12.907 --> 00:26:14.115 align:middle line:90%
on these kinds of traditions?

00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.974 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I don't know
people like me, George.

00:26:17.974 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may
be one of a kind.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I think so.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:10%
I really, really believe that
the information I'm getting

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:10%
is direct from source, and I
don't go to outside sources

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:10%
to get my information.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, unless I'm
researching Skellig Michael,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to tell you,
like I do in the book,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
about the history,
what we know so far.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm going to go
into my spirit traveling

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and give you a different
look at history

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see that there's
things that happened there

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that weren't
explained in the books

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that the monks kept because
they didn't want people to know.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was religion
that held them back

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:84%
from really telling the
truth about the pagans

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and what was happening
in their rituals.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But those monks on
Skellig were really

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
into what the Tuatha
de Danann knew,

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they went there.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.476 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
if they want to track your work?

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: On my website, sonja--
