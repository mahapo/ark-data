00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.634 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we're
in our Los Angeles studios

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:10%
for this program
with LA Marzulli.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We tried to beam LA
to our Denver studios,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
but something went wrong in
the teleportation device.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:90%
So here is.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LA MARZULLI: [LAUGHING]

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, always
good to see you.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Great to be here.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.547 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, George.

00:00:43.547 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You, of course, have
written a number of books,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
"On the Trail of the
Nephilim" being one of them.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But you're also well known,
you and Richard Shaw,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.445 align:middle line:84%
for the "Watchers" series,
which I think you're into-- what

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:56.643 align:middle line:90%
now?-- "Watchers" number--

00:00:56.643 --> 00:00:57.226 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: 9.

00:00:57.226 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 9 now.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Number 9.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Starting to film 9.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.346 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you and
I were talking when

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:90%
you in the "Watchers" 1 or 2.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:90%
So you've come a long, long way.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.002 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about "the
watchers," who are they?

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, it's
sort of a play on words.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:10%
We're watchers because
we're watching what's

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
happening on the planet now.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:10%
But the watchers are
actually a class of angels

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:10%
that we read about in
ancient prophetic text.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:10%
And there's good watchers
and there's bad watchers.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:10%
They're very powerful.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
sort of a play on words.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People have confused
extraterrestrial visitations

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
with heavenly visitation,
angelic visitations.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
When you read
Genesis-- and I read

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Genesis when I must have
been about 12 years old.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't put that down.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.679 align:middle line:90%
To me, it was a great story.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Sci-fi.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not that
it was the Bible.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a great story,
talking about how

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
this power that we call God
created the universe in seven

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
days and how the angels came
down, how the fallen ones took

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:90%
the daughter of man.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But at that young age, I
kept saying to myself, LA,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they're talking
about extraterrestrials,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
not angels, not godly things,
but extraterrestrials.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, I believe in God.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake about that.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe in a divine
power, something

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:90%
that created all of this.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is yet.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:90%
We may get to that today.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But I concluded at
a very young age

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with an
extraterrestrial story, not

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:90%
a biblical story.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Was I right?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, I would say
this, that in a classic sense,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
when we say
extraterrestrial, angels,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
whether they are fallen
angels or the good guys,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.452 align:middle line:90%
They don't reside here.

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
dimensional, more or less.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.118 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And they're
interdimensional.

00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So in a classic
sense, you're right.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.241 align:middle line:84%
But this is where it gets a
little shady, a little gray

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about the little guys.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Where did life come from?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.196 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago
the movie "Prometheus"

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
talked about that
life was seeded here.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
panspermia philosophy,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
which Darwinists hold on to,
that life was seeded here.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at the
complexity of the DNA,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
the deoxyribonucleic double
spiral helix of life,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
double helix, double
spiral of life,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely fascinating.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And it screams that this
just didn't happen by chance.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
co-discoverer, Crick,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA, double
helix, was a vexed man,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
so much so that he wrote--
and this is a quote almost

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
verbatim-- that in his opinion,
no matter how much prebiotic

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
sop in the billions of years,
there's no way this thing just

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
sprang into existence.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
made him search.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, where did this come from?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't go to, let's say
the God of the Bible per se.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And he began to look out
for the extraterrestrial.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I hold the
biblical narrative close,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:84%
not only because I've
been born again in spirit,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
which happened 35 years ago.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.235 align:middle line:84%
And this was after trying the
Carlos Castenada vision quests

00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and gurus with third eyes
open and all this stuff.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And finally just going, look,
if you're real, show up.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And he did, and my life changed.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
But there's a prophetic thread.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
differentiates that book.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a prophetic thread
from Genesis to Revelation,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
which no other book, no
other book on the planet has.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it calls it out a
priori, ahead of time

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:90%
with great specificity.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
With all due respect
to Nostradameans,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not like, well, you
can interpret this quatrain.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain passages that

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.632 align:middle line:84%
are prophetic in
the Bible, which you

00:04:48.632 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:90%
can interpret different ways.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.371 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Anybody can.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are some prophecies,
many, many prophecies,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
which are just right on.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And the chances of this
happening are astronomical.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems
like, I think we can

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
agree on this, that there's
an outside agency that's

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
outside of space time as we know
it and can call the future out

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and does so with
great specificity.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And thus we have the
prophecies in the Bible.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So in the classic sense,
the God in the Bible

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial, as
Jesus was an extraterrestrial.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because their home
is not planet Earth.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:90%
But they visited us.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.602 align:middle line:84%
But they're not ETs in
the way, let's say, that--

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not planetary ETs.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Exactly, exactly.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't come
from Zeta Reticuli.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly,
though some probably do.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Well.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe not
them, but I'm a believer

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that this universe is so
vast there could be millions

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:90%
of inhabited planets out there.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Could be.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's a-- and this gets
into the whole string theory

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But unless the universe is some
sort of a holographic place,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.522 align:middle line:84%
basically a hologram--
in other words,

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:90%
there's prophetic scripture--

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That it's not real.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.736 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, there's
prophetic scriptures

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
which talk about
the God of the Bible

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
rolling up the
heavens like a scroll.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we read that,
oh, that's just allegory.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:90%
That's just nonsense.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just put
there for our enjoyment?

00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: What if it's not?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:90%
What if He can do that.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
What if this whole thing
that we see, we're in it,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's real to us, but
yet these entities, when

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
they show up, they do things
here that defy our physics.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They come through walls, both
the good guys and the bad guys.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They materialize.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They materialize
and dematerialize.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And disappear

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They can
manipulate objects.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:90%
They can levitate.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:90%
They can move you, teleport you.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is all biblical.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
One guy's teleported from
one town to the other.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.314 align:middle line:84%
What the heck are
we looking at here?

00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
technology does that?

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
How are they able
to do this stuff?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond anything
that we know.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a frank
supernaturalist.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.032 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus is here.

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:52.865 align:middle line:84%
If you have leprosy,
we've talked about this

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast" many times.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
If you had leprosy in the
ancient world, you're dead.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:90%
You're a dead man.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were gone.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
You're history.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
They put you away.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's
it, unclean, unclean.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And 12 lepers are there,
and Jesus goes, go your way,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:90%
you're healed.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And only one of them comes
back, and he's totally healed.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So that happens on the
molecular cellular level.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:84%
How the heck, without
even touching them,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:90%
how was he able to do that?

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we don't know.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But what we see in the
personage of Yeshua,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that he's able to manipulate
space, time, and physics

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.989 align:middle line:90%
in ways that we have no idea.

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's why
some people believe, as I do,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that he was God and
came down to the planet.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Religiously,
they would say

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
he had that power,
that he was indeed God.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
There are some, though, that
say he tapped into a force

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.054 align:middle line:90%
and was able to do that.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, if
he's the only one--

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and the counterargument to that,
if there is a force and we can

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
all tap into it and
be like him, then--

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think we can.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Why hasn't
anyone done that, though?

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.856 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm not sure.

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have, John
of God in Brazil.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.834 align:middle line:90%
He's got that ability, they say.

00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: They say, right.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They say.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So with our "Watchers"
series, I want

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
you to recommend
a clip that I want

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to look at to give people
a little idea of some

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.897 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
you've been doing.

00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:90%
What can we look at?

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: "Watchers 7" is
just absolutely fantastic.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that we won the
Best Picture and Best People's

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Choice Award at the
UFO Congress in 2014.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.517 align:middle line:10%
And we went down to
see Jaime Maussan.

00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:10%
I know he's een on
"Coast" many, many times.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:10%
And Jaime opened
everything up to us.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.864 align:middle line:10%
He gave us terabytes of film.

00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And Richard and I are
just sitting there, just

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:10%
with our jaws on
the ground, looking

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:10%
at some of the most incredible
UFO footage we've ever seen.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:10%
But in my opinion, and we
show a montage of that,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:10%
the late Dr. Roger
Leir has a clip

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.680 align:middle line:10%
from Kumburgaz,
Turkey, which we show

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:10%
in "Watchers 7"
and "Watchers 8,"

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
which I show when I'm speaking
on the road at conferences

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:44.897 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And people just sit there.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.607 align:middle line:84%
You can hear a pin
drop in the place.

00:08:47.607 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's in "Watchers
7" and "Watchers 8."

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he videotaped
that, didn't he?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: He videotaped it.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:90%
He was there.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And the camera zooms up,
and there's the ship.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And there were two beings
just standing there.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.312 align:middle line:84%
And they just stand there
for like literally hours.

00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:90%
There's movement.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can see
them in the craft.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And you can
see them in the craft.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's very-- and
when I tell people this,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.947 align:middle line:90%
they say, well, was it staged?

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not Photoshopped.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.821 align:middle line:90%
We've looked at it.

00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Richard has looked at it.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The Turkish government has
vetted the photography.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:90%
This is the real deal.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably some of
the most clearest UFO footage

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
with the "grays" in
the control center,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
that, in the cockpit,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's in "Watchers."

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Leir let us use that.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a couple
minute piece, isn't it?

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at that.

00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
This truly is fascinating.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.906 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
-So, to being with, we
started focusing on the moon,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and this was a camera
mounted on a tripod.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:10%
We noticed that there
was a small, what

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be a
star below the moon

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:10%
and noticed that this
star was not a star.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And we got really tight
and close on the craft,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:10%
and what we saw was
absolutely mind-blowing,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:10%
because it was the front of
what appeared to be a disk.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:10%
And three portholes
were apparent.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:10%
Because they were lit
from the light coming

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:10%
from the inside of the
craft, whereas the craft

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:10%
itself was being
lit by the moon.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:10%
So in each portal, you
could actually see beings,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:10%
and some of them were the
typical black-eyed grays.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:10%
But there were other beings
that were there also.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:10%
So in this central port,
we saw several beings.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
one on each side.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, we filmed that
with a dog that

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:10%
was on the beach, who was just
barking his head off because he

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.762 align:middle line:10%
was seeing the craft.

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't barking at the moon.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:10%
And there was nothing
else going on.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:10%
So as long as we were
filming, this dog

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:10%
was barking until we finally
got the dog off the beach.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.345 align:middle line:10%
But it lasted for
quite some time.

00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember the exact--

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:10%
-Four or five hours at least.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:10%
-Yeah, it was enough to actually
see the craft change position.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:10%
It turned, and then
when it turned,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:10%
we could see that it
was not a saucer at all

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:10%
but more of a
boomerang-shaped craft

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:10%
that had sort of an
oblong aft end to it.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.812 align:middle line:10%
And then it would change
back to a central position.

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:30.853 align:middle line:10%
And it would move slightly
to the other position.

00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could actually
see the little beings up there.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And they look like
grays, don't they?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.791 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They look like
grays, and there's movement.

00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
Richard Shaw discovered.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Richard is a videophile.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
The guy's incredible.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
He's got his
amazing video suite.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.955 align:middle line:84%
He sat there and he slowed the
film down, very, very slow.

00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And then he noticed--

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Frame by frame.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.385 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Frame by frame.

00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And he started to notice that
there was a third alien that

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
was in the shot that was moving
like this, incredibly fast.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back and forth.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Back and
forth between the two.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:10%
And he's going, oh, my gosh.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:10%
What we think we're
looking at, maybe,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:10%
is someone laying on a
table that's been abducted,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.706 align:middle line:10%
and this third entity is
performing some sort of-- we

00:12:13.706 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:10%
don't know what he's doing.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
He's doing something to the--

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's like the
doctor or something.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And it looks
different than the other two

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It looks more
mantis-like, which ties

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
in the whole
ufology you've heard

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
about the mantis and the
insectoids, that type of thing.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And Richard shows this.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
We show a clip of
it in "Watchers 8,"

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:90%
which is just astounding.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's Rick's discovery.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Hats off to you, Mr. Shaw.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
they're coming here, that they

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:90%
have been coming here?

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:90%
What's so special?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What's so unique
about planet Earth?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, let's go
to Graham Hancock's book

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.209 align:middle line:90%
"The Supernatural."

00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, Graham and I have different
worldviews, and that's fine.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why I'm
quoting him now and using him

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
is because in my opinion,
he totally gets it.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
In his book
"Supernatural," he says

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.515 align:middle line:84%
that these entities-- because
he's taking ayahuasca,

00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and he's being
catapulted into what

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:90%
I would call the second heaven.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And to his absolute
astonishment, what he sees

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:90%
there are the grays!

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, wait a minute.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
What the heck are
the grays doing here?

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm on ayahuasca, and
the grays are here.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he wraps
it up and he says

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that these entities, wherever
they're from, whoever they are,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
seem to be obsessed with
reproducing with us.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And this ties back into
the Genesis 6 narrative

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
that we see, where
the fallen ones

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.714 align:middle line:90%
are creating a hybrid being.

00:13:36.714 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
about us they want.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Something
about us that they want.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
They want to have this
relationship where they're

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%
creating a hybrid being.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:10%
When we sat down
with Chuck Missler,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:10%
and he's in "Watchers 7" and
also in the first "Watchers 1,"

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Chuck stated very
matter of factly

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.442 align:middle line:10%
that the fallen cherub-- most
people know him by Satan.

00:13:56.442 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
that, it conjures up

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of bunch of nonsense.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
intelligent,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
incredibly powerful entity,
which is very dark, extremely

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:90%
demonic, incredibly evil.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost as
powerful as God itself.

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Almost, but no.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:12.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost, not quite.

00:14:12.955 --> 00:14:13.996 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: He's created.

00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
He's created, where God
just is because he is.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So Chuck says, and it's
an incredible statement,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that the fallen cherub, Satan,
is outnumbered two to one.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:90%
He's building an army.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we see in Genesis.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There's another prophecy,
which is overlooked.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, do that's
what he's doing now?

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
In Genesis 3--

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A physical army?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.228 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:14:35.228 --> 00:14:36.834 align:middle line:84%
And that will
manifest at some time.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Where are the hybrids?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For what?

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Where
are the hybrids

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.049 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Jacobs talked about?

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:42.381 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're gone somewhere.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Somewhere.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're in training.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: They're waiting.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And when this thing pops,
that's when the hybrids will be

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:90%
revealed as part of the army.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
they're coming back here?

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To take
over the planet?

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:53.893 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Jacobs believes that.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a domination of
one species by another.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.971 align:middle line:90%
That's a direct quote from him.

00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
taking them so long?

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: They're waiting.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
They're being held back.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By?

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: The good guys.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And again, this is scripture.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good guys in
other planetary systems?

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: No, the good angels.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, if we're in a
holographic universe,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
then what we see popping in
and out of the holodeck, as it

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:90%
were, seems real to us.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:90%
But we get time displacement.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's say Travis Walton.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:90%
We've interviewed Travis.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I know he's been on
"Coast to Coast."

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating man--
he's taken by them,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and he thinks he's
gone for a few hours.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.027 align:middle line:90%
He's been gone for five days.

00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:90%
So what are we looking at?

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
didn't treat him well.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.056 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They didn't
treat him well at all.

00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:40.965 align:middle line:90%
And he's told me they're evil.

00:15:40.965 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's told me
that right to my face.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, from Whitley
Strieber to Travis Walton

00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of cases of
abductions, not one has said,

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.325 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, I
wanna do it again.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
pleasant experience.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yes, can
we go this Saturday?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were hurt.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:90%
They were violated.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Things were taken from them.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Babies were extracted
from pregnant women.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Not one person said,
I had a great time.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.759 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: So who
does this sound like?

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Who does this sound like?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It sounds to me
like we're looking

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:90%
at the fallen angelic host.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
These are incredibly malevolent
but highly intelligent

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
entities which are creating
a hybrid being, just

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
like we see in Genesis
6 and also afterwards.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And then in Genesis 3, which
happens obviously before 6,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and it says-- there's a bunch
of people in this scene.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
There's the most high God
who's talking to Adam and Eve.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know this
sounds like sci-fi,

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:90%
but let's treat it like sci-fi.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to for a moment.

00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: So God's there.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Even are there and
the fallen cherub, the snake,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And the most high God
goes, OK, here's the deal.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm paraphrasing, making
it 21st century vernacular.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Your seed is going to
be at enmity, at war,

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:90%
with the seed of the woman.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.178 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.085 align:middle line:84%
The serpent's seed
is going to be at war

00:16:54.085 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:90%
with the seed of the woman.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
This sets up the rest of
the Judeo Christian Bible,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
so much so that the Antichrist,
which will come upon the Earth,

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
will literally be the
seed of the fallen one,

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
will be the seed
of Satan himself.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So we see the seed thing all
the way through scripture.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
Why should we be surprised when
we see the Nephilim in Genesis

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
6, when we see what's going
on in Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
when we see who was there
and the Levant when Joshua

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and Caleb go in and perhaps
the diaspora of Nephilim tribes

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that leave the Levant and
settle in different places

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
like we have next to us,
which is what we believe

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
are the remnants of some
of the Nephilim tribe,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
which are scattered
throughout the planet,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and now into modernity, where
we see the hybrid beings being

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
created.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
This ties back into scripture in
ways that are just astounding,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In prophecy, why
and how can this be foretold?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Because it's spelled out.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's spelled
out with great specificity.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:84%
The God of the Bible
dwells outside timespace

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:90%
He's merciful.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:90%
He's wonderful.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
He sends his son
here 2,000 years ago

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
who stands the ancient
world on its end.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of nonsense
has gone on in between

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and in the name of
Yeshua, of Jesus.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And religion has
certainly obfuscated

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
the whole deal in ways
that we don't have time

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.105 align:middle line:90%
to get into here.

00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
But it has.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's twisted a lot of stuff.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But I believe he was
God and man in one body.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And when he came here and
his death on the cross,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
he changed everything.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
That's like a critical
point in the entire timeline

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And he's coming again.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what prophecy states.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So you've got someone,
the God of the Bible,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
living outside space and
dwelling outside spacetime

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's no other book
on this planet-- yes,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:90%
the Hopis have some prophecies.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
There's prophecies in
the "Bhagavad Gita."

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
There are some
prophecies in the Quran.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get this
thread of prophecies

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
in a linear way from Genesis
to Revelation called out

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
with such great
specificity, which

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
talks about the coming of
the Messiah the first time

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.859 align:middle line:84%
and the coming of the
Messiah the second time.

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
There's only one book like
that, and that's-- and look,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.483 align:middle line:84%
the Bible's been used to beat
people over the head with.

00:19:14.483 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But what's in those pages
is absolutely profound

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.115 align:middle line:84%
and is really, in some ways,
beyond science fiction.

00:19:21.115 --> 00:19:22.239 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
talked a little bit

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
about Robert Salas in your work.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit more about him.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.081 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, we interviewed
him for "Watchers 7."

00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
incredible interview

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.485 align:middle line:84%
because he was very emotional
during that interview.

00:19:36.485 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we take a
little clip of it now?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI:
Absolutely, please do.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at Robert Salas

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and why he seems
to be so emotional.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
-The next thing I remember
was being on a table

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and being shown.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And they made a
point of showing me

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.042 align:middle line:84%
this, a large what
looked like a needle.

00:19:56.042 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:10%
And by large, I mean
large, almost a foot long.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:10%
They told me it was not
going to be painful.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.462 align:middle line:10%
But as they started to insert
this needle or whatever it was,

00:20:08.462 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:10%
it was excruciating pain.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's point
number two as far

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
as why this was a real incident.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Because I recall the pain.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I recall how bad the pain was.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
-Did you attempt to fight
them at this point at all?

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.095 align:middle line:84%
-I think I was struggling,
because I yelled out

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that this is very painful.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did that,
as soon as I expressed that,

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:90%
the pain went away.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It was just like magic.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.549 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I expressed the idea
that this was very painful,

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
the pain went away.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And they continued
with the procedure,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.567 align:middle line:90%
whatever they were doing.

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: First of all, it
was the first time he ever told

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
the story publicly on camera.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
We signed a letter or
a contract with him,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
which no production company
ever does, but we did.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
We said you can have your
approval on the edit.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Come in, make sure--

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That doesn't happen.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That
doesn't happen at all.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
getting it here.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: [LAUGHING]
I trust you guys.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we showed him the
clip, and he gave us the OK,

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is history.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't
twist his words.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
We didn't try to make it do
some funny business, what

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:90%
he was saying.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
He was emotional because
he came on the record

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and told about his
abduction experience

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and how he was abducted.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's classic.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely classic.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.759 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Again, another case
where it wasn't friendly.

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It wasn't friendly.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.174 align:middle line:90%
And he's laying in his bed.

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And we cut, actually,
to Dr. David Jacobs,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.174 align:middle line:84%
because as Bob Salas is
being lifted off the bed,

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the grays are
already in the room,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
these hooded figures, I
should say, are in the room.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.035 align:middle line:90%
He can't scream.

00:21:52.035 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:90%
He's paralyzed.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:84%
He's floated off
the bed this way.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And then now he's in repose, and
he's headed towards the window.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.774 align:middle line:84%
And he's going, I
locked the window.

00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
open the window?

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And we cut to Dr.
David Jacobs, who

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
goes, every single person
that's been abducted

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
has the same thought as
they're going to the window.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
How is this working?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And they go through the window.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them, or
through the ceiling.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Feeling no
temperature change, nothing.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.765 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Nothing at all.

00:22:18.765 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do that.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a different physics.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So whoever these entities are
have the ability to manipulate

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
spacetime in the ways
that we don't understand,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
at least not now.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing
with what's happening.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
When you had heard
abduction cases years ago,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.542 align:middle line:84%
would you have thought
everybody was whacked out?

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: When I first
started studying this,

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.344 align:middle line:84%
and this goes back
decades now, and I first

00:22:40.344 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
heard about Betty and Barney
Hill, it was just like,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.134 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be kidding me.

00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great story.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.466 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, and I
didn't want to believe that.

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy
in South America,

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Vilas Boas I think he pronounces
his name, it's like Antonio,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:90%
what did he go through?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
when I read "Secret Life"

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. David Jacobs,
and I kid you not,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I would read a page
or two at a time,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
put it down, and
walk away from it.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.375 align:middle line:90%
That's how upset--

00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's scary.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It scared me,
and it freaked me out.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary, scary, scary.

00:23:12.368 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Because
the phenomena was real.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.857 align:middle line:84%
If it was just Betty
and Barney Hill,

00:23:16.857 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's all we had to go on--

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Ever, then well, we
probably wouldn't be talking.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.535 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what we see.

00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I've talk to people
who have been abducted,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
who have had implants put
in them over-- I mean,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:84%
we talk about this in
"Watchers 7" and "Watcher 8."

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Bill, when he's five
years old, he's taken.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.306 align:middle line:90%
First time he fights them off.

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But the second time, he
can't fight them off.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.500 align:middle line:84%
He's taken straight
up out of the bed,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%
finds himself on the ship.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they keep coming
back, taking the same person.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.421 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And he's
got the implant.

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:84%
40 years later, he gets
the implant removed.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So the phenomenon is real.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It is burgeoning, and
it's not going away.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.777 align:middle line:84%
And people need to understand
what's happening here,

00:23:52.777 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a good thing.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good thing.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roger Leir would try
to get these implants analyzed.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And he had a
difficult time trying

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to determine exactly
what are they.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't break.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't cut into them.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like to you?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, a little piece of rice,
you say, but what are they?

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Are they tracking devices?

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Are they mind manipulators?

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This is where
it ties back, in my opinion,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:90%
into the biblical narrative.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the biblical narrative
in the Book of Revelation--

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
this was written
2,000 years ago--

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
tells us that men
and women will not

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
be able to buy, sell,
or trade unless they

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:84%
have this mark, Mark of the
Beast it's called, on them.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark of
the Beast, the 666.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.223 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Exactly.

00:24:37.223 --> 00:24:40.174 align:middle line:84%
So we listened to this stuff,
let's say, 50 years ago.

00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what that is.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It's probably allegory.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.844 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that they've got
their little RFID chip that

00:24:44.844 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:90%
will track them.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
these implants are.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
The second criteria found in
the Book of Revelation, anyone

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:84%
who takes this
mark, grievous sores

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
will appear on their body.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So whatever this
mark is is messing

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:84%
with the system, the
human circulatory

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.514 align:middle line:90%
system, human nervous system.

00:25:01.514 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Something is going on here
that's not user-friendly.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a reaction?

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Like reaction to it.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.357 align:middle line:84%
The third one, which
is really bizarre,

00:25:08.357 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
again found in the
Book of Revelation,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
a third criteria is
this, that anyone

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
who takes the mark will
not die in those days.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They will seek death
but not find it.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
They will seek death and
not find it in the days

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:90%
when they take that mark.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on there?

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to
that other prophecy,

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.046 align:middle line:84%
which states it will be
like the days of Noah.

00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
In the days of Noah, people
lived 500, 600, 700 years.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
What if these chips
that you'll get

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
will be-- you take
the chip, and you'll

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
live disease-free for
300, 400, 500 years?

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The line will be
around the block.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth one,
which is bizarre,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
states that anyone who
takes this mark winds up

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.492 align:middle line:90%
in the lake of fire.

00:25:49.492 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Where's the grace and mercy?

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:90%
There is none.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, there is none.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And the only time
we see grace and mercy withheld

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
like this from the
God of the Bible

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is when the Nephilim are
factored into the equation.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that these
implants are the precursors,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
the harbingers of
the implant, which

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is known as the Mark
of the Beast, which

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:90%
will change the hosts' DNA.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:10%
So you will no longer be human.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.192 align:middle line:10%
The human being that
sits in front of you--

00:26:22.192 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Won't be here.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Won't be anymore.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you'll live 500 years.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Your human-ness, what
makes you human--

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary, LA.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It is scary.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I think it is.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
website for people

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.376 align:middle line:90%
who want to track your work?

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Www.lamarzullil.net.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Better spell it.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI: M-A-R-Z, as
in Zebra, U-L-L-I dot net.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, my friend.

Thanks for being

I really appreciate it.

Thank you.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:10%

the Nephillim,

the "Watchers," the series by
LA Marzulli and Richard Shaw.
