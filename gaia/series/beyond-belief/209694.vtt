>>GEORGE NOORY: Three
near-death experiences?

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DEBRA MARTIN: Yes

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Before I knew it,
I was in another dimension.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I felt this presence
behind me, and I heard,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:90%
are you ready to die?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:90%
My body was being held by God.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: He's like,
you need to go back,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.433 align:middle line:90%
but you're going to have a gift.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
opened my mediumship up.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a case of Mary,
who has a little eight-year-old

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
daughter named Willa,
that you worked on.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was an
emergency healing.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It was the words
that God gave me

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:90%
to tell Mary, hold your faith.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't listen to the
doctors, because all things

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
are possible.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're tearing me up.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I offer my body up
to be the instrument and vessel

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:84%
for each and every
person that I heal.

"Beyond Belief" program for you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:10%
Debra Martin is with us, an
intuitive healer, certified lab

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
research medium, and
she's had three near-death

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:10%
experiences herself and
has developed a very unique

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:10%
distant-healing technique.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Debra.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.127 align:middle line:90%
It's good to have you back.

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Thank you.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm doing
really well, thank you.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to see
you in-person again.

>>NOORY: What happened to you?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Well, each
one gave me something

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:10%
that I've learned from,
and the first one,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:10%
I was in an automobile accident.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It was the same night that
Princess Diana had passed.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.435 align:middle line:84%
I was out with a
few friends, and it

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:90%
was time to get in the car.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.635 align:middle line:90%
And I had a premonition.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You felt
it, didn't you?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:10%
Don't get in the car,
but my friends were like,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.458 align:middle line:10%
don't worry about it.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:10%
You're just worried,
because you just

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:10%
watched Princess Diana pass.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got in the car.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We were driving on the freeway
home, and I heard in my mind,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
something's going
to happen right now.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.233 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I subconsciously

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
must have knew that we were
going to be in a car accident,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:90%
because I said, no.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Not now.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I have three beautiful children.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
They need me.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, a van with no
windows came and sideswiped us.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we took
out 40 feet of guardrail.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It was a sports car.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I was in the back seat,
little, little pocket

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:90%
left, facing oncoming traffic--

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No seat belt on, right?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.705 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does in the back seat.

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It just all broke.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%
So we couldn't get out.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.373 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment,
we were panicked.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to get out?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
We see cars coming towards us.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
injured at the time?

00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: The driver was.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:90%
She broke her leg.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having a neck
injury, but during the accident,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
you don't know that.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
feel anything.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You don't
feel anything.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just too
much you're in shock.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.845 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Where am I?

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So this gentleman came to
our door out of nowhere,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:90%
was able to open the door fine.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Took us each out, carried
us to the embankment,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
him looking at me.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
He kissed my forehead, and he
said, you will meet me again.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:90%
You will be fine.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no, no, no, no.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
This ring that
I'm wearing today,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's pressing
on my finger.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's making it bleed.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
He took this ring, put it
in his mouth, and bit it.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I have his teeth marks.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He bit it off?

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: He bit it and bent it.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.165 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you tried to, you can't.

00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard ring.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You cannot bend it.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your teeth would break.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Right, and plus you're
putting somebody else's blood

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:90%
in your mouth.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
People don't do that, right?

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially
in those days.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So ambulances
were coming from the right.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I happened to look to the right,
and when I looked to the left,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%
he was gone.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:90%
No one's seen him.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your angel?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, divine
intervention at that moment.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that opened my door
to what just happened.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.425 align:middle line:90%
The afterlife, who was that?

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
It brought an awareness to me.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
near-death number one.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
What about number two?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So number two
was a car accident again.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and cars
don't work out well.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, well, no more.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I was
sitting at a turn

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
bay ready to go
into a neighborhood,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
any premonition.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I was just being waiting for
traffic to go, so I could turn.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Before I knew it, I was
in another dimension.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
down on my car,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.482 align:middle line:90%
and I was witnessing myself--

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
out of your body?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I was out of my
body in another dimension.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you didn't
know that at the time?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
it until I heard--

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt this presence behind
me, and I heard, are you ready?

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you ready?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I knew,
are you ready to die?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Life's too good.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
In a split second, I
looked down, and I said,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to survive that.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no way, right?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.902 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There's no way.

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
tractor truck carrying

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
another truck,
tractors behind it,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to come and crush me.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going
to survive that.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I woke
up in the back seat of my car

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
again in this little,
little pocket.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
All windows were broken out.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything inside of the
car was out in the street,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and I had a mouthful of glass.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
A police officer and a
gentleman were at my door,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and he was saying,
are you OK, ma'am?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK, ma'am?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.247 align:middle line:90%
We're so sorry.

00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to get this man
that was on a diabetic seizure.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you back in
your body by that time?

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I was back
in my body, and all I

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
remember is now I have
a mouthful of glass.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, we
were in pursuit

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to get this man off
the road, and he

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
was in a diabetic seizure, and
you're what he came to stop.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He passes out--

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So he hit me
at 65 miles an hour.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So then he asked the
gentleman next to him.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Sir, are you OK?

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm really shaken.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I should have killed her.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.855 align:middle line:84%
In a split-second, someone
took my steering wheel

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and put me into
oncoming traffic.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:90%
It's that same entity.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And then that's
when it clicked to me.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I saw that.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw that, but
not only did I see

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:90%
that, I was hearing a spirit.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So I know that another
dimension exists.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I know that I was somewhere.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
opened my mediumship up,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I went to the
University of Arizona and got

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.105 align:middle line:84%
tested by Dr. Gary Schwartz
and Dr. Julie Beischel.

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good people.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Good people.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
experience, these first two,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
changed your life?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.242 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It shifted the core
of who I was, and who I became.

00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know who the
wonderful Raymond Moody is?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Raymond,
of course, a legacy

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:90%
of near-death experiences.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
He talked with us about
the common elements

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.592 align:middle line:84%
that people experience like you
during near-death experiences.

00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
And basically they

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:10%
consist of elements that are
common all over the world.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:10%
Not every person has all of the
elements, but among the things

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:10%
that people say are that they
hear the doctor say something

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:10%
like, oh my God, he's dead.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Or we've lost her.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is very
surprising to them,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
because they say
that I have never

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:84%
felt so alive as when I heard
that doctor say, I was dead.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Because from their
point of view,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
they feel that they
distance themselves

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
from their physical
body, and they

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
watch the scene of
the resuscitation

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:84%
typically from a point
of view above it.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
As this progresses,
they eventually wake up

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that this must be
something to do with death.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they enter
into states of consciousness

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
they say there are
no words for it.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
That it's ineffable
or indescribable.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and they go through panoramic
memory, in which everything

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
they've ever done is
displayed around them

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in a holographic,
three-dimensional panorama.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:10%
with a total new take
on life, thinking

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.120 align:middle line:10%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:10%
is to learn how to love.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:10%
And saying that they have
no more fear of death,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:10%
because they feel that
death is just a transition

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.468 align:middle line:10%
into some other reality.

00:08:43.468 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did some of those
things happen to you, Debra?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's like I'm
hearing him speak about me.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is you?

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, because I do
feel that we're here for love.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that I do
everything out of love,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.526 align:middle line:90%
and my healings are about love.

00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And it did feel when
I went to these spaces

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was surrounded by
love, and it shifted me not

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:90%
to fear death at all.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think with
these first two experiences

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.197 align:middle line:90%
you were saved?

00:09:14.197 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They gave me a lesson.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:90%
They taught me something.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:90%
They showed me something.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The first one was the awakening
of divine intervention.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else was
there to save me.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started the
search on the journey

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:90%
of what is the afterlife?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
The second one really opened
the door to my mediumship.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing the voice.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
I heard them.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:90%
They're on the other side.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Something exists beyond us,
so that opened that door.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the third NDE,
I was sick and dying.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:90%
I was down to about 90 pounds.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Mayo Clinic couldn't figure
out what was wrong with me.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 90 pounds?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I was in extreme
pain, so I wanted to die.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I lost all dignity, all hope.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I had four
children, one daughter

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that was still living with me,
and she was in third grade.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So to think of it
now that I wanted

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to leave her seems like I
couldn't even think that way.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it selfish?

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It wasn't.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I felt like you're not
thinking of your family members

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:90%
You're thinking about--

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yourself?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I can't
exist this way.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I have no quality of life,
and so I was praying.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Please take me.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it emotional pain?

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Or what kind of pain was it?

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Physical pain.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physical?

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I couldn't eat even a
piece of toast, a little bite,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.693 align:middle line:84%
without being extreme pain
almost like I was in labor.

00:10:40.693 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where was the pain?

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All in the gut.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your stomach?

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very weird.

00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever find out
what was wrong with you?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, they didn't,
and I asked God that question.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.875 align:middle line:84%
How come I never figured
out what that was?

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was,
if we would have

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:84%
told you what was
wrong with you,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
you would have labeled
yourself with this.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
You would have said
that this is what I had.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
This is what I have.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And by not ever knowing, I
never say that I had something.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So I
was praying daily.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Please take me now,
and spiritual surgeons

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:90%
showed up in my room.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you would think that would
sound crazy, but being a medium

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a spirit,
it didn't frighten me.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, maybe they're

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
here because I'm praying,
and I'm going to be healed.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it became
painful, and I knew

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
I needed to just calm my mind.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just took a deep breath,
and when I took a deep breath,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I left my body.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another OBE.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And this time,
I felt myself leaving.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I was slowly
transitioning upward.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.632 align:middle line:90%
It felt like you were floating.

00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
like this feeling?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I loved this feeling.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I was no more in pain,
and I was like, OK.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, where am I going?

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was going
through this light,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and I became where
I just was standing.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was on
clouds, and I'm just

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:90%
looking around like, OK.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm here all by myself.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I saw these
hands coming out like this.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe God will come
to you in many forms for you

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
to see.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.762 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like to describe
what I saw, because I don't

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
want it to limit it to people.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, I
saw that I was being held.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:90%
My body was being held by God.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I could see my hair
draped down, but I

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
was-- my soul was watching.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
My spirit was watching.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm out of body seeing this,
and now I'm filled with love.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Just surrounded with
love like I felt safe.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It was like it was just
I wasn't even questioning

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is not like
the other two NDEs, is it?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, this
is so profound.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So I followed God, and he put me
on this beam of light, my body.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
He took me into this
space, where we were

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%
going to have a conversation.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
why do we have to go

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:90%
into-- it was like a dome.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, because what
I'm going to speak to you

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:90%
can only be heard by you.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I was shown a
life span contract.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And it said, I was
on borrowed time,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and I was supposed to come back.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
want to go back.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I was arguing.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were happy there?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, and I even
asked, can I see my parents?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:90%
No, Debra.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't see your parents.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
won't want to leave.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.688 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they passed on?

00:13:45.688 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So I said, can I stay
here for a little while?

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, no.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.683 align:middle line:84%
You need to go back, but
you're going to have a gift.

00:13:53.683 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
was the healing?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That was
the healing, and he

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
made me sign the contract.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, remember
this date, 1/21/12.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
All things are reversible,
and so is this.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So when I came
back into my body,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I could feel myself
floating back.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was like as if the
whole body moved like this.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Like I was coming in.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if
you're underwater,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and you go, like that.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that, when I
took that big breath like that,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what just happened?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:90%
And am I the same person?

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're back
in your body again, right?

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a jarring effect?

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have witnessed
some miraculous healings,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
many of which you
have done yourself.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a case of
Mary in Massachusetts,

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
who has a little eight-year-old
daughter named Willa

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:90%
that you worked on.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what you did.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: What happened
with Willa was I

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
got a call from her aunt, and
I was told that baby Willa was

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital in Boston.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.548 align:middle line:84%
I was told nothing about
what was wrong with--

00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how old
was Willa at the time?

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.393 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: 14 months.

00:15:07.393 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little baby?

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it was an
emergency healing.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And so without knowing anything,
I went into the healing.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I had her picture.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I placed her picture
on my abdomen,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:90%
so that I can become her proxy.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the mother
expect you to be doing this?

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, the mother
knew I was doing this.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:90%
She gave permission.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So during the
session, I felt like I

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:90%
was connecting with Willa.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I could see Willa, and I could
see this spiral of energy

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
like a figure eight
going through the body.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And that it was going
through all different areas

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%
And as it does, then it heals.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It sits into where it needs to
go and just heals those areas.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a lot of work
being done on the head.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I could feel as if there was
energy and a being standing

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
there working on this
area of the head.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So a lot happens during
a healing session.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm feeling the
things happen on my body,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm experiencing pain
and going through it.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm also seeing baby Willa,
and I'm hearing words from God.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the words from God were
saying not only to baby Willa.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be OK.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And being held.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt she was
being held by God,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and she was nodding her head
like she was giving permission.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But words to the
parents of doctors

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.117 align:middle line:84%
who are going to say that
this isn't looking good,

00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't going
to be something doctors

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
are going to be able to fix.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Only the highest divine can fix.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
definitely are not

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
going to accept you
as a healer, are they?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.732 align:middle line:90%
Doctors are strange.

00:16:52.732 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I don't even
know if the doctors know

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this.

00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At the time?

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But I'm
recording this,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to get
the recording of what I say

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and what happens.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying to them
is, don't believe the doctors,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because the doctors
are going to say

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that this isn't looking good.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
So part of your role
is to keep your faith.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Then I was told--

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing the
number three, twice.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Three, three.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
I asked the question.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Three meant in three days, you
will start to see improvement.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
In three weeks,
she will be healed.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt this
pressure in my ear.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:90%
My ear hurt.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:10%
It was right at the
end of the session.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:10%
I think I might have even
turned the MP4 off at that time.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you hear
a ringing in your ear?

00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, just extreme
pain like my-- almost

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
like your eardrum's
going to erupt.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And it popped.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember that pop,
and then I remember

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:90%
water draining out of it.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's really weird.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Debra, with
the wonders of Zoom,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going live
to Massachusetts,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:90%
where Mary is right now.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Little Willa will
join us in a moment.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Mary, hello there.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MARY FRANKE: Hi, George.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Debra.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great to have
you on the program.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like for
you to tell us how

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
you met Debra,
how you found her,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and the astounding thing that
she did for little Willa.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:10%
>> FRANKE: Yes, I can.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, first off, I couldn't have
done this without you, Debra.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have gone through it.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, and
we love you so much.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know Debra.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know her name.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about her.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It was my sister that
reached out to her.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the third day in
the hospital so right

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We had just arrived
and been quarantined

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:90%
for three weeks, a long--

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
very long three weeks.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So when my sister said,
I'm going to arrange this.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
She's going to do an
emergency healing.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
She has this long wait
list to work with her.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But somehow I got
through, and she's

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:90%
willing to do this for us.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
being like, OK.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.565 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It was just in the hospital
mayhem of everything

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was particularly a time
of being there that we didn't

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
feel like we had any answers,
anything concrete, anything

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:90%
scheduled.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
all these surgeries

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
they might have
to do and will do,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
so it was this moment of, OK.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:90%
We have something.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
We have something going on,
and I said to my husband,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
we need to listen
to this recording

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:90%
that we'll receive tonight.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how
we do it or when,

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
but we found a time
to do it that night

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:90%
to listen to her recording.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
Willa was 14 months

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:90%
when all this was happening.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:90%
What was wrong with her?

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:90%
What did the doctors tell you?

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> FRANKE: So she was 14 months.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
She was completely
healthy and happy,

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and there was never
anything wrong with her.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
She went to her 15
month visit a couple

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of days before this started.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed the swelling
happening in her neck,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and we took her to
the pediatrician.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
They weren't concerned,
or they didn't scare us.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But they said, it could
be a swollen lymph node.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:90%
She might have an infection.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's put her on antibiotics,
and this was the first time

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:90%
putting her on an antibiotic.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So they sent us home, and then
she wasn't feeling any better.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
She was grabbing at
her neck and crying.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So we got scared, and we called
the doctor back and said,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
can we come back
in for a checkup?

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And so we went back in.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
She got a blood test,
and they sent us home.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
They said, we'll call
you with results.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And they called, and I
think I had gone back

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to work that day
after the appointment.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you need to
rush her to the ER immediately.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: Her white blood
cell count is through the roof,

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really know
what that meant at the time.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.765 align:middle line:84%
But it indicates that your body
is really fighting something,

00:21:11.765 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and they were scared.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So we took her to the ER.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Luckily we lived
in the city, and we

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
were close to the best
hospital in the world.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt like we
were in good hands.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And that first day may have
felt like the longest, because I

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
just was dreaming about that
next day where I'll be home.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And this will all be figured
out, and everything will be OK.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And then we never left.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was just from one day
to the next, it was bad news.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:84%
They never were able
to understand what

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:90%
these abscesses of infections--

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
why any antibiotics or any
drugs were not penetrating it

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and weren't--

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't getting any better.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
cancerous at all?

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: We didn't
know at the time.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
They really couldn't identify
the infection until--

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
really, the last day was
when they were like, OK.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't this.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It was this, but they
never knew what caused it.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They stopped asking
questions, and they just--

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
it was irrelevant at the
time after a few days.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what did they
recommend, Mary, for treatment?

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: They tried every
heavy antibiotic they had.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
This was IV, after IV, after IV,
after blood test, fresh blood

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:90%
test.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And then she had
major surgery to try

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to drain the abscess in the
base of her head and her neck,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and they were hoping to
reach the second one, which

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
was in the worst spot it could
possibly be in your body.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it threatened
to burst, and expose,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and infect your whole body
and be a fatal situation.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
drain the first one.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
They weren't able to
reach the second one.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:90%
So it was really a nightmare.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she dying?

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: I never let
myself believe that,

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
but after it was
all said and done,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
we talked to a lot of
specialists and head

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was usually a fatal
situation in that circumstance.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when Debra
entered the picture,

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:90%
what did she first say to you?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cure your daughter?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this?

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And what did you think?

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: It was nothing I
knew at the time, but after,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
it all made sense.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But what I did know, and
what I did observe and take

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
from the words was that
this is going to be a longer

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
road than you think.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.408 align:middle line:84%
She isn't going to get
better for three weeks.

00:23:58.408 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
was like, three weeks?

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been three
days, and each day

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
was like a year
when your child--

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I believe it.

00:24:05.663 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANKE: But she said,
I need you all to listen,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.257 align:middle line:90%
and you are all part of this.

00:24:12.257 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:90%
She needed to get our attention.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So we could be her
strength, and we could not

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:84%
let this fear in that was
coming from everywhere.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But did you have
the full faith and confidence

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
in Debra at that point?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: In my
heart, I think I did.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know, and
my husband certainly

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
was like, so she
doesn't even know us.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know why we're here.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know anything
about what-- she really only

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:90%
had her picture.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But a lot
of people, Mary,

00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
would think this kind of healing
is nothing but mumbo jumbo.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Did that ever hit your head?

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> FRANKE: No, not for me.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you believed
from the beginning

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:90%
that this could work?

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: I had more faith in
her words, and her instruction,

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and the way she gave me a
roadmap for that experience was

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:90%
what I clung to.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting information
24 hours a day from three teams

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.845 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital.

00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hold that
thought, Mary.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.512 align:middle line:90%
Hold that thought for a second.

00:25:18.512 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Debra.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you're with
Willa and Mary,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:84%
what did you do to
make her feel better?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.145 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was the words that
God gave me to tell Mary was--

00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and that was very difficult for
me to send to you, was to say--

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and I even get emotional
now, because it just

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:90%
brings it all back.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But to tell a mother
that their daughter's

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be, in three
days, to get better,

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and I know nothing
what's going on.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And then to say in
three weeks to the day

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:90%
she's going to go home.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But to stand in your faith
that that's your role.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Hold your faith.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Don't listen to the
doctors, because all things

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
are possible.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're tearing me up.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was
really a miracle.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to send
that recording to you

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know,
saying, OK, God.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm trusting you, and with that
trust-- because with the work

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that I do, I have
to have 100% trust.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So by me giving it
to you, trusting this path,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:90%
you felt that.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And you felt that
love, that God's love,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you held on to.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a
knowingness within you

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that this was coming
from someone higher.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:84%
How else would I know
that I'd have an ear pain

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and describe that it hurt?

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had some water
come out of it?

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
any doubts that you

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:90%
would make her feel better?

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None?

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And what did the doctor say,
Mary, after this was done,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and Willa was fine?

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: Well, the
miracle was they'd never--

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
they were amazing.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But what healed her, and what
they couldn't even explain

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:90%
was what Debra did.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what she said.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, there
was this pus just

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:90%
globbing out of her ear.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was so unfathomable,
they didn't even

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:90%
take it seriously for two days.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, it must just
be a separate ear infection

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And finally, infectious
disease came, and swabbed it,

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and checked it.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
this is the infection

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that we were about to have to do
this risky surgery to just try

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to get to save her.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And now it's globbing
out of her ear.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's not possible,
because there's no pathway.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And it had to have
plowed through,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.413 align:middle line:84%
made its own route out to her
ear instead of infecting her.

00:28:17.413 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
miracle, wasn't it?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> FRANKE: It was a miracle,
and they really couldn't explain

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And their doctor
language said, well,

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
this is something you'd read
about in a medical journal.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
know how this happened.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now Willa
is eight years old?

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>> FRANKE: Yes.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How's she doing?

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> FRANKE: She's wonderful.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of her.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:90%
She's all love, kindness.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:90%
She sings all day.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:90%
She does art.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's bring her in.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Where is she?

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Go get her.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: George, God also
said that this would never

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
come back for Willa.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly a miracle.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Normally I don't misstep, Debra.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm a tough guy.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I have
never talked to Willa.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you will tonight.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm really close
to the mom and her sister.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:84%
We've seen each
other several times.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, we match, Willa.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Willa, how
are you feeling?

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLA FRANKE: Really good.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I just drew this.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to finish it, but--

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh my gosh.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Did you draw that?

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: Uh-huh.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to finish the blue
sky, but it's you and Layla.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's me.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Layla's my dog, and Willa
wants a dog like mine.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:90%
That's precious.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.535 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to have it.

00:29:51.535 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Willa, you were
little when this happened.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:90%
You were 14 months old.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
remember too much,

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:84%
but what do you
think of all of this?

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You look great.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: Pretty good.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your mother tells
us that you sing and dance.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: I do.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what are some
of your favorite songs?

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.817 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to
ask you to do that.

00:30:12.817 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANKE: I've been working on
this song for a couple minutes

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
over there in the kitchen.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you
give us-- just stand up.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.423 align:middle line:90%
Sing the song for us.

00:30:28.423 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We just
need the camera moved,

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:90%
so we can see her face.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Move back a
little bit if you can.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Willa
knows how to do it.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She knows technology.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You're on.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: The pandemic helped.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Did home schooling.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.299 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANKE: (SINGING)
How many days

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
do you lie awake in
the darkest days?

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
All I know is if
happy lives a mile

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
away, a couple stands
is all it takes.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:05.642 align:middle line:84%
If kindness lives in everyone,
a couple steps is standing up.

00:31:05.642 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Wow.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great voice.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's beautiful.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I love the words.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I understand
today is your birthday.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: Uh-huh.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Happy birthday.

00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:18.405 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, wow.

00:31:18.405 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: Thank you.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bye, Mary.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Bye, Willa.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Bye.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.428 align:middle line:90%
[BLOWS KISS]

00:31:22.428 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANKE: Bye.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Miss you.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a miracle.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's a miracle.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fantastic.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So we just saw Mary and little
Willa and heard from you.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
miracles I've ever witnessed.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
What exactly did you do to
make that little girl better?

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I call them
my goddess love healings.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I tap into a frequency
that I call is God's frequency.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going through you?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Through me.

00:31:53.435 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And I offer my body up to
be the instrument and vessel

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to receive all that I need
for each and every person

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that I heal, not knowing
anything about them.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever fear,
Debra, that whatever ailment

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:90%
they have will transfer to you?

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, I never fear that.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm the
instrument and vessel.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I may feel very extremely
tired after a session.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I have to do things to
keep myself healthy.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But no,
I'm not worried.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I know that when the session
is complete, it's all gone.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you feel pretty
good after a session.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I'm always in awe.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, listen to that session.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Every session is like that.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my knees in gratitude.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'm crying,
going, oh, my gosh, I

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:90%
got to send this one out.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Wonder what's going
to come from it.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
feedback you get.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can't deny
what's taking place--

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that these are profound healings
and energy coming from a higher

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.060 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take
you to rejuvenate yourself

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:90%
after something like this?

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So the session
usually lasts an hour.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, I
take the time to relax,

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:90%
to receive energy for myself.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I also ask in a healing that
I'm receiving energy as well so

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not
depleted completely.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Depending on if it's major--

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.230 align:middle line:90%
like a major cancer--

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I may have to rest for a
couple hours afterwards.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Eric Pearl was
on Gaia's "Inspiration" show,

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.123 align:middle line:84%
talking about how he
discovered healing abilities.

00:33:29.123 --> 00:33:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ERIC PEARL: I went
into the next room.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:10%
I worked on the patient.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:10%
I told the patient, as always,
to just close their eyes,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:10%
relax for a minute or so
before they open their eyes

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:10%
and got up.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And when he opened
his eyes, he said

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:10%
to me, who walked into the
room while I was lying here?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:10%
I said, no one, why?

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:10%
He said, no, like
I didn't hear him.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:10%
Who walked into the room?

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:10%
I said, no one.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:10%
He said, I heard them come in.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:10%
I said, no one came in.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:10%
He said, I heard them
standing at the door.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:10%
No one was at the door.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.858 align:middle line:10%
I went back and forth
and back and forth.

00:33:52.858 --> 00:33:55.020 align:middle line:10%
Finally, he said,
OK, but I could tell

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:10%
he didn't really believe me.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:10%
I didn't give it much thought.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:10%
I went in to see
my next patient.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.547 align:middle line:10%
When I finished with
her, she opened her eyes.

00:34:02.547 --> 00:34:04.963 align:middle line:10%
She said, who walked into the
room when I was lying there?

00:34:04.963 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:10%
I said, no one, why?

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.173 align:middle line:10%
She insisted the same story.

00:34:07.173 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Back and forth.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARL: All in all, seven
patients in this one day

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.429 align:middle line:10%
insisted that someone
came into the room,

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.385 align:middle line:10%
stood there, walked
around, ran around.

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Two of them actually
looked at me

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.052 align:middle line:90%
and said it felt as if flying--

00:34:19.052 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
someone was flying
around the ceiling.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, after 12 years
in practice, no one

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.268 align:middle line:10%
had ever said anything
to me like this before.

00:34:26.268 --> 00:34:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So seven people in
one day, you would

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.210 align:middle line:84%
think that this would
have gotten my attention.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:10%
But other patients are
saying, I can feel your hands

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.107 align:middle line:10%
before you touch me.

00:34:34.107 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:10%
Of course I didn't believe them.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:10%
I said, so lie down
and close your eyes.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:10%
They had their eyes closed.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
I held my hands in different
directions, several feet

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:90%
to several yards away from them.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:44.168 align:middle line:90%
They could tell me.

00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It was aimed toward their feet.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It was aimed towards
their shoulders.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:10%
I would see tiny little muscles
in their forehead or chin

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:10%
ripple, the way you drop
a pebble into water,

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:10%
and it begins to ripple.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:10%
Involuntary muscles-- muscles
we couldn't move by intention.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:10%
I would see their eyes
rapidly dart back and forth

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:10%
when they'd open their eyes.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.548 align:middle line:10%
They would tell me
they were seeing

00:35:01.548 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:10%
colors they had never before
seen, smelling flowers

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:10%
they had never smelled before.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:10%
And they started reporting
healings-- real healings.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:10%
They were getting up out of
wheelchairs, vision and hearing

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:10%
returning.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:10%
Children with cerebral
palsy and epilepsy

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:10%
were able to walk and run and
play, not have seizures, not

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:10%
need their medications.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Their parents would call.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Their doctors would call.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.045 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, what did you do?

00:35:21.045 --> 00:35:22.498 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
didn't do anything.

00:35:22.498 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And don't tell anyone,
which went over about as--

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GARR: Were you
afraid of your gifts?

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.283 align:middle line:10%
I mean, were you afraid of this?

00:35:27.283 --> 00:35:28.365 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARL: No, no.

00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:10%
I may have been--

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:10%


00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.600 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what the word is.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:10%
I was in awe of something large.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know that I was
quite ready yet for people

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:10%
to start talking about it.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric's normally
not speechless like that.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Did you experience similar
things that he did?

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So my healings are distant.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.200 align:middle line:90%
People are never there with me.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:90%
They're--

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never?

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.843 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, they're in
their own sacred space.

00:36:06.843 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It could be anywhere
in the world.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's nice because then
I'm not picking up their energy.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:84%
One woman told me,
had she come in,

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I had told her that
one side of her body

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.107 align:middle line:90%
was higher than the other.

00:36:19.107 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said, had I come
in and laid on the table,

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:84%
you would have seen that because
I didn't have a left breast.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't
have known that,

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and you talked about that.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting, he talked

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:84%
about them feeling the energy,
them feeling his hands,

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:90%
not even being on the body.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
to people that are

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.480 align:middle line:90%
relaxing in their sacred space.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.603 align:middle line:84%
They actually feel
the energy that I'm

00:36:43.603 --> 00:36:45.520 align:middle line:84%
going through with what
they're going through.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I've thrown
up bile, and I find out

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:84%
they're throwing up bile
at the same time I am.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
of these patients

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.130 align:middle line:84%
can you comfortably
handle a day?

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I will only do one.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, because--

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.628 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it's
got to exhaust you.

00:37:01.628 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I just
believe it's their day.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And their healing will
continue through that day.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
percent of the people

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:90%
experience these miracles?

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I will say, everyone
will receive something.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:84%
It may not be exactly
what they think.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.500 align:middle line:90%
But I am only the instrument.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
There's times where
I'll be like, really,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this person
was going to survive.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.970 align:middle line:84%
God, why did you
take this person?

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they received
an easier transition.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:90%
They were at peace.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.695 align:middle line:84%
So I never know what
somebody is going to receive.

00:37:32.695 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But I trust that they
will receive something.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What generally
creates these miracles, Debra?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it you or the individual
or both of you together?

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I believe--

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had people come
that are totally skeptic.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And they don't need to believe.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to be a
certain religion to receive.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.498 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's
out of my power.

00:37:55.498 --> 00:37:57.040 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else working here--

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.335 align:middle line:84%
a higher power, an absolute
one that is in charge.

00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through you.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Through me.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at Maureen
Hancock on Gaia's "Open Minds,"

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.085 align:middle line:84%
talking about her
miracle recovery.

00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUREEN HANCOCK: I fell asleep
at the wheel on a stormy March

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:10%
night in 1992.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:10%
And I was the designated driver.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I had just dropped
all my friends off.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We were at a
nightclub in Boston.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.640 align:middle line:90%
And I got tired.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- it
was rainy and cold.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And my eyes dropped,
and I hit a tree.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I had just taken the seat belt
off because it was a new car.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It was digging into my neck.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was right near my house.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my
grandmother with me--

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:84%
the same grandmother who had
the intuitive abilities, read

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
tea leaves, and her sister
was the well-known mystic.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, oh, Maureen,
and went through my body.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing outside of a
completely crushed vehicle when

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.710 align:middle line:90%
the fire rescue team came.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who called 911
said that somebody shook her

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
out of a sound sleep and said,
go downstairs to the kitchen

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, "Night
of the Living Dead."

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I was a mess.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: You
were a little zombie.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And so they brought
me to a local hospital,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
where they realized every
bone in my face was broken.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I had to be rushed to Mass
General, Mass Eye and Ear

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in Boston.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And the second CAT scan after
the first one at the local

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:90%
was completely different.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything was healed when
they went to do surgery.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I was going to say,
you would show no marks of that

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.605 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I didn't
have to have anything done.

00:39:31.605 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:90%
So it was a true miracle.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking fractured
skull, my eyes, cheeks, nose,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:90%
jaw.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I had spinal fluid coming
out and stitches right down

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:90%
the middle of my face.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, my god.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:51.105 align:middle line:84%
And so after that, I
started to hear dead people.

00:39:51.105 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anybody
perform a miracle?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Or do we have to have the
special gift that you have?

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I really--

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't teach it.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So I would say we
have an ability.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But I can't teach
the gift that I have.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God-given?

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I believe
mine was God-given, yes.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why can't any
of us do this if we believe?

00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I believe there's--

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through so much
to get to where I am.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
The trust and to be
at the level that I am

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
that I have,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to remove my humanness aside,
my ego aside, and allow my body

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to be completely
used as a vessel

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and then use my mediumship
to hear spirit, what they're

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:84%
saying, to see the
spiritual surgeons come in,

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and to tap into this
frequency-- it's taken years

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.540 align:middle line:84%
to come up and develop this
technique that no one else

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.680 align:middle line:90%
is doing in the world.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying, Debra?

00:40:52.347 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm not
afraid of dying.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you ever?

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I never really
thought about dying before.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:04.150 align:middle line:10%
When my parents
passed, I guess I

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:10%
would say that I'm more
afraid of being buried.

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the thought
of being underground.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.502 align:middle line:90%
But dying, no.

00:41:13.502 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey, I had a
story on "Coast to Coast"

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:84%
a while back about a lady
who woke up in her casket

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.950 align:middle line:90%
at the funeral home.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.750 align:middle line:84%
They heard her
knocking on the casket.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, my gosh.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's your
phobia, isn't it?

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, right.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How can people call
you for help or assistance?

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.313 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: They can go to my
website at goldenmiracles.com.

00:41:32.313 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debra, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm, thank you.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You truly
are a miracle worker.

00:41:36.957 --> 00:41:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, thank you so much.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sorry for
getting so emotional.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:10%
But I got to tell
you, it felt great.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:90%
