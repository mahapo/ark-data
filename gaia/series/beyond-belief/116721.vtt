00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:07.462 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:08.670 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.901 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:25.134 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
And you know, by
watching this program,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:10%
we deal with a number
of subjects-- mysteries,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:10%
conspiracies, you name it, we
cover it on "Beyond Belief",

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
including how to protect your
life, how to prolong your life,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:10%
how to make it a
fulfilling life.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do that
this hour with the Ben Fuchs.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
He's a registered pharmacist.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.244 align:middle line:84%
He is part of the steer-head
of criticalhealthnews.com,

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
a website devoted to helping
you naturally with supplements

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and special foods.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can't think
of a better topic

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to talk about with you, Ben,
about longevity and protecting

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:90%
your own careers and lives.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.521 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN FUCHS: Thank you, George.

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And as a registered
pharmacist, I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:10%
get to see the impact of bad
choices and good choices.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And I get to see how
our disease states, what

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:10%
we call disease states, or
breakdowns, or degeneration,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:10%
is really a function of things
we're doing to ourselves.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I've dedicated
my life to helping

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
people understand how
their actions are affecting

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:90%
their health and their wellness.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's on the negative side.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But on the positive
side, how actions

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
can help you reverse every
single chronic degenerative

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.907 align:middle line:90%
disease you can name.

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I should tell you at
this point that there's

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a distinction I'm making
between chronic degenerative

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.624 align:middle line:84%
disease and accidents
or genetic kinds--

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things that happen.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.414 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't often make
that distinction

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
in the world of health.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Chronic degenerative
disease is, by definition,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
a health challenge where your
body doesn't do its healing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
business.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Something interferes with
the healing mechanism that's

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:90%
built into the human body.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, every time
you cut yourself,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
this little miracle happens
that we take for granted.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You get a paper cut, two
days later, it's gone.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's healed up.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.785 align:middle line:90%
It's sealed.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: George,
this is a miracle.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:90%
How the heck does that happen?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
All the tiny
biochemical reactions

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and chemical
processes, microscopic,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
nanoscopic, femtoscopic,
biochemical processes

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that have to kick in
for that cut to heal,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
it is the most mind blowing
system, mind blowing dynamics,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:90%
that you could possibly imagine.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, when you
have a chronic degenerative

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.819 align:middle line:84%
disease-- and millions
upon millions,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.735 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of millions--

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Something is interfering
with that system.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interfering
with that system?

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it pixie dust that's being
sprinkled on you from above?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it some kind of curse that
an evil priest put on you?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Um, maybe.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Probably not.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the foods we're eating.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the thoughts
we're thinking.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the actions we're taking.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, by changing
the foods we're eating,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
changing the actions we take,
changing the thoughts we think

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings we feel, by
using these simple mechanisms

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that require no doctors, that
require no medical authorities,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that require nothing outside of
us, our diabetes can reverse,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
our cancers can reverse, our
skin diseases can reverse,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:90%
our osteoporosis can reverse.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Because it's built-in.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the system.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It's inherent to the system.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And it happens
everywhere in life.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
If you cut a plant, if you
cut a leaf off of a plant,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only, George, not only
does the leaf grow back,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
it grows back bushier.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You get more.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.286 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It protects itself.

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You get extra.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So the system is designed
not only to heal itself,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
but to get better when
it's under duress.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not happening,
something's in the way.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Something's interfering.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Something's blocking it.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.752 align:middle line:84%
And if you accept the
premise that our choices,

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
whether they're actions
or thoughts or thinking

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.185 align:middle line:84%
or emotions or foods or
whatever it is, our choices

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:09.324 align:middle line:84%
are what makes us
who we are, then

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a short leap
to understanding

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.281 align:middle line:84%
that our choices,
through the choices

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
we make-- independent
of outside authorities,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
independent of
the medical model,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
independent of
priests of medicine--

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:90%
we can heal ourselves.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:90%
We can access the healing power.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.006 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are some people
watching this program right

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
now, Ben, who are sitting on
a couch, eating potato chips,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
drinking carbonated soda,
and they're probably

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:90%
a little overweight.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a lot of overweight.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.744 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're obese.

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.035 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: 100 million Americans.

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's easy
to stop, isn't it?

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh my goodness, George.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking
to your producer.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
He lost 11 and didn't even try.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
As a health care professional,
I get to see people

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
As a presenter, as
a public speaker,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I get to see mass
numbers of people

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I tell you that
diseases can reverse

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
or that people can lose
weight or that diabetes

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
can go backwards,
I'm telling this

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.432 align:middle line:84%
based on thousands of
people that I've witnessed

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:90%
over the last 20 years.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
blowing smoke at us.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I'm not blowing smoke.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's so easy, George.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
A couple things.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy, number one.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
But it happens so
quickly, number two.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:90%
You can lose pounds in a week.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You can lose 11
pounds in 20 days,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
not even doing
anything difficult.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
what I call power foods.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
By making sure you're
ingesting substances

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that are dense with
nutrition, dense with power,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
if you will, because that's
what nutrition is, and sparse

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
on calories, which
represent heat,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
you can give yourself
immense amounts

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition, immense amounts
of vitamins, minerals,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and phytonutrients without
burdening your body.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.749 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key
to losing weight.

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key
to getting healthy

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
from a food and digestive
system perspective.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.025 align:middle line:84%
Now thoughts, emotions,
spirituality--

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all play a part.

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All play a part.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But from a physical perspective,
the foods that we eat

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.865 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how to
leverage the foods that we eat.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I love that word, leverage.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Because what it means
is taking advantage

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
of things-- exploiting or
using what things give you.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.969 align:middle line:84%
To me, the greatest invention--
they said the greatest

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
inventions was the wheel.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.884 align:middle line:84%
I think the greatest
invention was the lever.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Because with the lever, you can
move these huge blocks of stone

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:90%
with a tiny little push.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's what leverage does.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So nutritionally dense
foods give you leverage.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
A small amount of a
food like a mushroom

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
or a small amount of
a food like an olive

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
will give you the same
potency, the same power,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
the same healing ability that
a huge pizza would give you,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's costing you hardly
any nutritional, hardly any--

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know now, every
time I order a pizza back

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
at the office, let's
say, if I'm staying in,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for my
show, I'll take two pieces

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
and give the rest away.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I take it down to our
engineering department.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And I say here's a box.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.035 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's
another strategy.

00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
We eat for flavor.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you give
yourself flavor, you'll

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
find that you're eating less
calories and less foods.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And that really is the key.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It's getting the calories down.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you feel better.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.701 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And you feel
lighter on your feet.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing worse
than feeling bloated.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: In the
stomach, constipated.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Constipation is
like an epidemic.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And to have all that weight
inside your intestine,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%
it literally weighs you down.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It makes you feel heavy.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.327 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever have a colonic?

00:07:30.327 --> 00:07:32.493 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what that is,
where they Roto Rooter you

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:90%
from the inside?

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eh, none
of your business.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I'm telling you-- I'm
a health care professional,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
we talk about everything--
you feel so light on your feet

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
when you have your
intestines cleaned.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to have a colonic.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Fast for a day.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.649 align:middle line:90%
People say they can't fast.

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:90%
You actually feel better.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just drink
water, you're saying?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Just drink
water or lemon juice.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want to-- you
probably should be hydrated.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
vitamins, supplements.

00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You take
your supplements.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.605 align:middle line:84%
But the point is the
calories are the problem.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And over the last
20 years, George,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
what we've done
as a culture is we

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
figured out how to divorce the
calories from the nutrition.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So we've created thousands
upon thousands of food products

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that have plenty of
calories, but they

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:90%
don't have the nutrition.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Calorie represents heat.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have given the
body this massive influx

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
of heat without the
nutrition that helps

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:90%
the body process the heat.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So the key to losing weight,
the key to feeling better

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
from a physical perspective,
from a food perspective,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is to do the opposite,
is to figure out

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
how you get high nutrient
with low calorie.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
power foods come in.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
A power food-- something
like algae, for example,

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
or seaweed-- is powerfully
dense with nutritional value.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
With vitamins, with
minerals, with proteins,

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:90%
with essential fats.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:90%
And no calories.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are a pharmacist.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You went to college to
learn how to mix and match

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.985 align:middle line:90%
drugs and dispense them.

00:08:56.985 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Did you make a mistake?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.821 align:middle line:84%
As far as the career goes,
here's the thing about

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
pharmacy-- when you
think about pharmacy,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.535 align:middle line:84%
when the average person
thinks about pharmacy

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
or the non-pharmacy person
thinks about pharmacy,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
they think about the
guy in the white coat,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.693 align:middle line:90%
behind the counter--

00:09:09.693 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At one of
the big drugstores.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Counting pills.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Counting pills.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.379 align:middle line:84%
They call, in pharmacy school,
we call it count, pour, lick,

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
and stick.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Count the pills.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And we hate that as pharmacists.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't go
to school to do that.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A technician
could do that.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Anybody.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
A monkey could do it.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:90%
The vending machine could do it.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.685 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
going to have

00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
is a vending machine from now
on doing that, in the future.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we all did when
we went to pharmacy school

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is we wanted to
manipulate chemistry

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.582 align:middle line:84%
to create healing therapeutic
effects on the body.

00:09:38.582 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to be the chemists.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.047 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to make the stuff.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wanted to mix this.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And throughout history
this is what chemists--

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:44.816 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The alchemist.

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:90%
The modern day alchemist.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.946 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's
what pharmacy was.

00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus, the father of modern
medicine, was a pharmacist.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And he used to mix herbs
in a mortar and pestle.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they did it.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to
pharmacy school

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and when most pharmacists,
or many pharmacists,

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
went to go to
pharmacy school, we

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
went to make the
medicine to do things.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
When I graduated pharmacy school
and went to work in drugstores,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I was horrified by what it
was, but it wasn't my intent.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So what I started to do was I
started to apply what I really

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do, which is
making medicine for people,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to the world of nutrition,
to the world of skin care.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started formulating
nutritional supplements

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.045 align:middle line:84%
and I started formulating
skin care products.

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And formulation
isn't exactly making

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
things in a mortar and pestle.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's along the same lines.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's close.

00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's close.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I used my pharmacy
background, understanding

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
medicine, understanding herbs,
understanding nutrition--

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
one of the things

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
we study in pharmacy
school, believe it or not,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
is nutrition.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Except we don't study nutrition
like a dietitian studies it.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:90%
We study it like a pharmacist.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
We study the medicinal
value of vitamins.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
We study the medicinal
value of selenium,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the medicinal value of
minerals, the medicinal value

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:90%
of phytonutrients.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
How you can use
vitamins and minerals,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.497 align:middle line:84%
we study this in pharmacy
school-- to heal eye problems,

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to heal skin problems, to
heal digestive problems.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, we
study deficiency diseases

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.114 align:middle line:84%
as if they were nutritional
deficiency components.

00:11:13.114 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Degenerative diseases.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.672 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a guy by
the name of Dr. Joel Wallach.

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Brilliant man.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a veterinarian,
but he understands nutrition.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
He understands it.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
He looked at animals
and he figured

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.187 align:middle line:84%
humans are the same
way, same complexity.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: He did autopsies.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
formed Youngevity,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
which is part of
criticalhealthnews.com,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and has come up with all kinds
of things to help other people.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Now he speaks all around the
country, Ben, as you know.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And his latest topic is
someone needs to go to jail.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's watch a little
clip of Dr. Joel Wallach.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. JOEL WALLACH: The medical
system hasn't learned anything.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we eliminated
that disease in children

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
25 years ago in China.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:84%
In China, these
cardiomyopathy heart disease

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that these athletes die from
is called Keshan disease.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
This one province doesn't have
the selenium in the soil there

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and these kids,
like 13 out of 100,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:84%
are dying from
this heart disease

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're little kids.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So my wife and I
went there in China.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
We did 1,200 autopsies on these
kids, kids under the age of 10.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government now gives
every kid this trace mineral

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:90%
when they come to class.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
They haven't lost
another kid in 25 years

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
because the government
makes sure under penalty

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
of severe punishment if
the teacher fails to give

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:90%
those kids that pill every day.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Here we have these kids--
we've known this in the animal

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:90%
industry for 60 years.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:84%
For 60 years, we've known the
cause, prevention, and cure

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.169 align:middle line:90%
for this disease.

00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet medical
doctors say, well, we

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
give them electrocardiograms
before each season.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:90%
We just need more physicals.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.567 align:middle line:90%
That'll do it.

00:13:00.567 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, no, it won't
do it, because they

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:10%
know nothing about nutrition.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize
that when you sweat,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:90%
you're not sweating out water.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:10%
You just drink water,
you're going to die,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.572 align:middle line:10%
whether you're a roofer
in the summertime

00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:10%
and it's 120 degrees
up there on the roof

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.434 align:middle line:10%
and you're sweating like a
pig, or you unload trucks,

00:13:17.434 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:10%
or you work in a factory or
do physical labor on the road,

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:20.724 align:middle line:10%
or you're an athlete.

00:13:20.724 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're sweating, you're
not sweating out water.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.686 align:middle line:84%
Sweat is a soup that contains
all the nutrients floating

00:13:26.686 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:90%
around in your blood.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're replacing
that soup with water,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.417 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to your
nutritional reserves?

00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Replacing the soup with water,
your nutritional reserves

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
go down.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.654 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach a certain
level, below a certain line,

00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
you die.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:10%
There's another
19-year-old girl just died

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.165 align:middle line:10%
of a copper deficiency.

00:13:43.165 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:10%
She's 19-years-old.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Florida State University.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:10%
Died of a ruptured
aortic aneurysm, which

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.892 align:middle line:10%
is caused by only one thing.

00:13:48.892 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, two things.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.391 align:middle line:84%
One, you get crushed
against a loading dock

00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:54.324 align:middle line:84%
by truck, or a
copper efficiency.

00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:84%
We learned about that
in turkeys, Scott.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, we eliminated ruptured
aortic aneurysms in turkeys

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.782 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:14:01.782 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So she died of something
a turkey wouldn't even

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
die from because medical doctors
know nothing about nutrition.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They all should be
put in jail for it.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.556 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He really knows
his business, doesn't he?

00:14:11.556 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I call him a polymath,
because Doc doesn't just

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:90%
understand nutrition.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.465 align:middle line:90%
He understands history.

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:18.506 align:middle line:90%
He understands sociology.

00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:90%
He understands anthropology.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
He understands chemistry.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:90%
He understands medicine.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.622 align:middle line:84%
He understands
physiology and anatomy.

00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And he understands nutrition.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And he puts it all together
in his presentations

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and in his books
and in his tapes

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:90%
in a way that's so compelling.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In his interviews
with me on "Coast to Coast."

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: His interviews with
you on "Coast to Coast."

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It is so compelling, you just
can't stop listening to it.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
it's not just compelling

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and you can't stop
listening to him.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.692 align:middle line:90%
You feel inspired.

00:14:43.692 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:90%
You feel hopeful.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to learn more.

00:14:45.733 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You feel like your
diabetes is not a curse.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.025 align:middle line:84%
You feel like your health
challenges are not inevitable.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not doomed.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
started listening

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Wallach 20 years ago.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I got tapes in the mail.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Those dead doctors-- do you
remember the dead doctors?

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Dead
Doctors Don't Lie."

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.775 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I started getting
these tapes in the mail.

00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing presentations
myself at the time.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just stuck
them in a drawer.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, who is this guy?

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Who is this guy?

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And one day I put
the darn tape in

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and I start listening and
this guy-- first of all,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:84%
he sounds like he's coming
from Mount Sinai on the tape.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
He's outside God.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So he's got this
powerful booming voice.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
But then he's
talking about things

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
that only pharmacists know.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
mineral deficiencies.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
degenerative diseases

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
as being caused by
nutritional deficiencies.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about the soil.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.167 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
glucosamine and chondroitin.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about
chicken soup and bone

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
soup, what I call bone soup.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.941 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, who is this guy?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
started to study him,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:90%
the more I was like, blown away.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started to listen to
the tape over and over again.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I start to do my presentations.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.149 align:middle line:90%
I would talk like him.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I'm
in the gym working out

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.172 align:middle line:84%
and I tell my buddy
about the tape

00:15:54.172 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that I've been listening to
and this guy Dr. Wallach.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.529 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at me and he
goes, I know Dr. Wallach.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like personally?

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.174 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Like personally.

00:16:01.174 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.809 align:middle line:90%
This was the '90s.

00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And a doc was traveling
around the country,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
as he still does today, and
he was preaching the gospel

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.979 align:middle line:84%
He'd been coming to
Denver on a regular basis

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and so my buddy knew him.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
He says, do you want
to meet Dr. Wallach?

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to meet this guy?

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
how that happened.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And that's
how that happened.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
One day I'm in my lab and Dr.
Wallach walks in, sure enough.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And we hit it off.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been listening
to his tapes.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.736 align:middle line:84%
So when I was talking
to him, he thought

00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
he was talking to his
doppelganger or something,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.646 align:middle line:84%
because I was repeating
back everything.

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A young version of him.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.444 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: And we hit it off.

00:16:32.444 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd start
doing his radio show.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I started becoming
involved with this company.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of my
nutritional mentors,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:90%
one of my nutritional heroes.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in
the coming decades

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.854 align:middle line:84%
when we look back on Dr.
Wallach and Dr. Wallach's work,

00:16:45.854 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:90%
we'll tell people about him.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.436 align:middle line:84%
He'll be this
mythological figure.

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He'll be a
historical person.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Ben, I just read
where scientists

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
are working on more
topical solutions

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:90%
to make the hair grow faster.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:90%
But what about foods?

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh, yes.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:10%
In fact, you could evidence
how healthy somebody

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:10%
is by their hair.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:10%
Because when the
body's deficient,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:10%
it's going to pull nutrients
away from parts that it doesn't

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:10%
consider as important
and redirect them

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.964 align:middle line:10%
to the parts of it does
consider important.

00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first place you'll
notice deficiencies in nutrition

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are the nails, the
hair, and the skin.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And a good skin
care professional

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
or a good physician
for that matter

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
will look at somebody's
nails, skin, and hair

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and make a general assessment
on how healthy or not healthy

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.045 align:middle line:90%
that person is.

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I always look at the nails.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Nice nails.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nails OK?

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Skin?

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.186 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Skin is good.

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Hair is good.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.292 align:middle line:90%
Doing good, George.

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little tinted.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You must
know something.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
You must know something.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
No, but you've got a
nice strong head of hair.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.952 align:middle line:84%
And so the point is
a very good point.

00:17:43.952 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
nutritional things

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.618 align:middle line:90%
that you can do for the hair.

00:17:46.618 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
First thing, the
digestive system.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, George, it
always the first thing.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probiotics?

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Probiotics
and glutamine

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and less food and drinking water
with your meals and apple cider

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.895 align:middle line:84%
vinegar and digestive
enzymes, lecithin.

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
slew of things you

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%
could do to improve digestion.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
As important as nutrition
is, if you're not

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
absorbing out of the gut,
what the heck good is your--

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not working.

00:18:08.773 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but a lot of
poison enters into the blood

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:90%
through the digestive tract.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.813 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I had to
tell you the number one

00:18:15.813 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
cause of disease,
degenerative disease,

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the number one cause--
it's dirty blood.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a post on Critical
Health News about that.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Dirty blood.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Self-induced
dirty blood.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Self-induced.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.767 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to
doctor, physician,

00:18:28.767 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and you ask about the
leading cause of death

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.099 align:middle line:84%
in hospital settings,
he'll tell you

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:34.265 align:middle line:90%
about something called sepsis.

00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:90%
What is sepsis?

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you get
that, you're in trouble.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:37.455 align:middle line:90%
ICU.

00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
You're in serious trouble.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:90%
So what is sepsis?

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Dirty blood.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, they'll tell you it's
life threatening, which it is.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
infection, isn't it?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Basically it's an
infection, bacterial infection,

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's something called
sub-clinical sepsis, which

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is dirty blood that's
not significant enough

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to land you in an ICU,
in an emergency setting.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's gradually
getting dirty.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It's on a continuum.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So you start off with a
little dirty blood, then

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of dirty blood,
then more dirty blood.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Eventually when the
blood becomes dirty--

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Bible says
the blood is the life.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the blood is touching
every single part of the body.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
the disease state,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter whether it's
on your head or on your foot

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or in your pancreas
or in your liver.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
What matters is the part
that all these systems have

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:90%
in common, which is the blood.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So you gotta clean the blood.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
How does the blood become dirty?

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Through the digestive system.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.562 align:middle line:84%
So the digestive
system has two roles

00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:34.894 align:middle line:90%
to play when it comes to health.

00:19:34.894 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Number one, nutrient absorption,
because if you're not

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.763 align:middle line:84%
absorbing, it doesn't
do you any good.

00:19:38.763 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And number two, by its
proximity to the blood.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority
of the blood comes

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:90%
through your digestive tract.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.262 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any kind of
leakage, leaky gut, where

00:19:49.262 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:84%
the intestines are
starting to break down

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and things are getting into
the blood inappropriately,

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:84%
you're guaranteed
to eventually end up

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
degenerate disease.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.009 align:middle line:90%
What is Western medicine?

00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, when people
talk about Western medicine,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.725 align:middle line:84%
they usually mean it as
distinct from Eastern medicine.

00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And Eastern medicine
is a type of medicine

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that recognizes there's
more to the physical world--

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Eastern philosophy in
general-- recognizes

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.305 align:middle line:84%
there's more to
the physical world

00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:15.369 align:middle line:84%
then just what we can
see with our eyes.

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what Eastern philosophy
and Eastern medicine is about.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.429 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine, on the
other hand, is about this.

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
The material world.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.282 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pharmaceuticals.

00:20:22.282 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: In terms of
medicine, it's about drugs

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's about surgery
and it's about cutting

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.091 align:middle line:90%
and it's about radiating.

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's about working with what
we can see with our eyes.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as the distinction
goes, they're both important.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
If you get hit by a car, if
something drops on your head,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
you don't care
about your chakras.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You want somebody
to stitch you up.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.229 align:middle line:90%
And fast.

00:20:42.229 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: And fast.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in pain, you don't
want somebody chanting over

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
you, you want a
friggin' pain pill.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:90%
You want to be out of pain.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So Western medicine
really has a place.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But where it
doesn't have a place

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is when it comes to
how we live our lives.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And as we were saying earlier,
chronic degenerative disease

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.432 align:middle line:90%
is about how we live our lives.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And so Eastern
medicine has a place

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.671 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to more long
term kinds of health issues.

00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine has its
place when it comes to acute.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you used
some of Western medicine?

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Great question.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I love that question.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Praise God, I don't have
any medical problems,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
so I haven't had to go to
a medical doctor for blood

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
pressure or for diabetes
or anything like that.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
However, I used to
play baseball a lot

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.954 align:middle line:84%
and I had several major injuries
to my knees and to my ankles.

00:21:30.954 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you ever
tore your knee up, George--

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank god.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Let me
tell you something--

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've been very lucky.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Played a lot of sports, but
I never really got hurt.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You're blessed.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when you hurt your
knee or you tear up your knee,

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it is indescribable
what that's like.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.114 align:middle line:84%
And I went and had
my knee surgery.

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were wheeling me
out of the operating room.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The pain was so intense,
George, that there

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
was a voice coming in the air.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It was my voice, but it
didn't seem like my voice.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was saying
morphine, give me morphine.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
out of my control.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.816 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't saying vitamin
C. I wasn't saying protein.

00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
pain-killers.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I wanted pain pills.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I always, to this day, I
tell people, keep some pain

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:90%
pills in your medicine cabinet.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You never know when you're
going to need some pain pills.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I am obsessed
with not using pain pills.

00:22:24.532 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You're a strong man.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I will take the
pain and fight it out.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.255 align:middle line:90%
I'll take a little aspirin.

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:31.963 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You understand
the mind, though.

00:22:31.963 --> 00:22:32.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Ultimately, the
mind can control everything.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
They do hypnosis, they deliver
babies, they cut off limbs.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese used to do major
surgery under hypnosis.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you as an aficionado
or connoisseur, if you will,

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, you
understand that all pain

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:90%
is derived from the mind.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
The pain isn't here.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:90%
The pain is here.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we have control.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But for people who don't
have that kind of control,

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine's ability to
manipulate pain and get people

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:90%
out of pain is unparalleled.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And Western medicine's
ability to stitch people up,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:84%
it's miraculous
what they can do.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
For the long term, chronic
degenerative diseases,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.116 align:middle line:84%
which, George, make up 80%
of our health care issues.

00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Huge.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
These are lifestyle issues
that involve, as we said,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, mentality,
emotions, food, nutrition,

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.514 align:middle line:90%
movement, exercise.

00:23:23.514 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
Eastern medicine really

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
excels in distinction to
Western medicine, which

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
is a complete and
utter failure when

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
it comes to how it addresses
these kinds of health issues.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.575 align:middle line:90%
Plants make female hormones.

00:23:36.575 --> 00:23:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Why would a plant
make a female hormone?

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.474 align:middle line:84%
It is the coolest thing why a
plant makes a female hormone.

00:23:41.474 --> 00:23:42.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is.

00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Why would a plant--

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Why would a plant
make a female hormone, right?

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:90%
This is how brilliant nature is.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
A plant, like every
other living thing,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.409 align:middle line:84%
has one primal directive--
to live and to give birth.

00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To reseed.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.991 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: To reseed.

00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So plants will
make phytoestrogens

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
because estrogen is a
birth control for rabbits.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.997 align:middle line:84%
Estrogen functions to shut
off the ability to conceive.

00:24:04.997 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use it
in birth control pills.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So phytoestrogens
are made by plants

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
as chemical warfare
against the rabbits

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and the plants that would
dare to eat the plant.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But not for the rabbit
itself, but for the rabbit's

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:90%
future generations.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.174 align:middle line:90%
How cool is that?

00:24:21.174 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Plant thinks
that far out, huh?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The plant
thinks that far ahead.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:90%
That's how brilliant nature is.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.064 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, for
a lot of people

00:24:27.064 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
who are vegans, if they only
knew plants are real and aware

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.595 align:middle line:90%
of being eaten.

00:24:33.595 --> 00:24:35.575 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It might be different.

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Not only that--

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd
starve themselves.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Plants don't
want to be eaten.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
there's no toxic meat,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
but there's plenty
of toxic plants.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of toxic--

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you get the
wrong mushroom, for example.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Mushroom, for example.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:90%
I talked to people all the time.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh--
they have arthritis

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
or they have
inflammatory diseases.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, but I
only eat organic vegetables.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:90%
I only eat salads.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.767 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, it could
be your tomatoes.

00:24:58.767 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It could be your potatoes.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.047 align:middle line:90%
It could be your lettuce.

00:25:01.047 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:90%
It could be your broccoli.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be anything.

00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Anything.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So plants make their
own chemical weaponry.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But one of those
chemical weapons,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
or a class of those
chemical weapons,

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.467 align:middle line:90%
are called phytoestrogens.

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have wonderful effects
for the hair and for the skin.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Phytoestrogens.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.385 align:middle line:84%
And how do you know where
to get a phytoestrogen?

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You've got to
listen to guys like me

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:90%
talking about phytoestrogens.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But the most common ones
are going to be legumes,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.156 align:middle line:90%
soy is the most famous of--

00:25:27.156 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beans.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Beans in general will
happen phytoestrogens in them.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.077 align:middle line:84%
Herbs like red clover
and red raspberry.

00:25:33.077 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a wonderful herb--

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I must have too many
phytoestrogens in my diet.

00:25:36.645 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well,
your hair's great.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But look at my
eyebrows, for crying out loud.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You probably have
bushy eyebrows, right?

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're not bushy now.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.425 align:middle line:90%
But they're probably bushy.

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a healthy
set of hair on your head.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a sign of a
vitality, a sign of masculinity,

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen some
guys with eyebrows that

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.424 align:middle line:90%
are like grown over their eyes.

00:25:57.424 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:90%
They have to comb them back.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.149 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I had a girlfriend who
told me I had bushy eyebrows.

00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know people
look at your eyebrows.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some of the foods.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric, of course,
is one of my favorites.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I have talked about this
on my radio show for years.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.159 align:middle line:84%
Might have been the first
radio host to bring it up.

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
What's it do?

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.533 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Turmeric is
ridiculously important.

00:26:19.533 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You know what the coolest thing
about turmeric is, George?

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.053 align:middle line:90%
Is that beautiful or what?

00:26:23.053 --> 00:26:24.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks beautiful.

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:24.594 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:26:24.594 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me show that color.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Smell it.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that delicious?

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You know what's
cool about turmeric?

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
grind it up, right?

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Grind it up.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
They make curry
powder out of it.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But wherever you see
colors in nature--

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Curcumin.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Curcumin, that's
the active ingredient.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Curcuminoids, they call them.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So here's the cool
thing about nature.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
You know how there's
color everywhere?

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.137 align:middle line:90%
Greens, and blues, and yellows.

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gorgeous.

00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Peppers.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Yellows.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.507 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It could
be black and white.

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have all these colors?

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of color?

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Color is actually an
electromagnetic transducing

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
device that turns or helps
turn the sun into matter.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
think of this?

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's amazing.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat this orange,
it helps your body process

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
electrical energy,
especially in your skin,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
where it acts as an anti-cancer
tool, anti-aging tool.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anti-inflammatory.

00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Anti-inflammatory.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the most
medicinal of all the--

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that's saying something--
medicinal of all

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:84%
the plant/herbs
that you can ingest.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.685 align:middle line:84%
But a scientist back in the
'70s did some researcher

00:27:27.685 --> 00:27:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and discovered it was
powerfully anti-cancer.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And when the literature
came out all of a sudden

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
there was an explosion of
research about turmeric.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.469 align:middle line:84%
And now today, it's like
almost every week, you

00:27:36.469 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:84%
read another article, you hear
another study, about turmeric.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I take a turmeric
supplement every day.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Very smart.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.339 align:middle line:90%
Very smart.

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know what
you could do now?

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Chew on this.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Just nibble on it.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just nibble
on it if you need that.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Shave it off, I guess, right?

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You could shave it off.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:90%
But you can-- can I?

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to--

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.215 align:middle line:90%
You want to eat that?

00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:55.156 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Just nibble.

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:56.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ginger.

00:27:56.495 --> 00:27:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about ginger.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.137 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Ginger's awesome.

00:27:58.137 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:90%
It's in the same family.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:84%
You notice how
these look the same?

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Kind of the same.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Same family.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.842 align:middle line:90%
Very strong root.

00:28:02.842 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Ginger's another
one that you can nibble on,

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're nauseous.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
For women who have morning
sickness or for hang-overs.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did not know that.

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Powerful
antiemetic, anti-nausea.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Tastes great.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But I love ginger
as a massage tool.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
If you just chop it up
and heat it in some oil,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
it makes an incredible
warning massage, ginger does.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And of course, ginger tea.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.454 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves ginger tea.

00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Garlic, of course.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.131 align:middle line:84%
Keeps away vampires
and what else?

00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Probably.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And heart attacks.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's incredibly
important for your blood.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And who doesn't like garlic?

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.855 align:middle line:84%
I always found it
interesting how--

00:28:40.855 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All I know is if
you're going on a date,

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:90%
you both better have it.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.885 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I was going to say,
why do people not like smell

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:90%
of garlic?

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:90%
What is it about that?

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.251 align:middle line:90%
It's pungent.

00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:50.552 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Is it bad?

00:28:50.552 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't smell like
it's rotting or decaying.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.551 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's strong.

00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I could never--
I don't have a problem

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:90%
with the smell of garlic.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But what people are
noticing when they smell

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
is the smelliest of all
the elements-- sulfur.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And that sulfur is one
of the major reasons

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
why this stuff is so powerful.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Sulfur is highly
electromagnetic.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like eggs.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.267 align:middle line:90%
Like eggs, hydrogen sulfide.

00:29:14.267 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
In nature, wherever
there's a lot of sulfur,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a lot
of electromagnetic energy.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.356 align:middle line:84%
And so garlic is one of the most
highly electromagnetic foods

00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:22.856 align:middle line:90%
you can eat.

00:29:22.856 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And this gives it very
important properties

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:90%
for the circulatory system.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very good.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.669 align:middle line:90%
What about the mushroom?

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: There's so many reasons
we could extol the mushroom.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.626 align:middle line:84%
There are some
people who actually

00:29:32.626 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:84%
think that the mushroom was
the manna from the Bible.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
There are some serious
researchers who believe that.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
There's some people who
believe that civilization

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.059 align:middle line:90%
started with the mushroom.

00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can't
figure out where

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:90%
those cave paintings came from.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:90%
They just appeared, right?

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Where the heck did
they come from?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:52.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody did it.

00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But all
of the sudden, how

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
do they get the
idea to cave paint?

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, this guy-- have you ever
talked about Graham Hancock?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he's
been on my program many times.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.444 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: He says it was this.

00:30:03.444 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:90%
He said somebody ate--

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A magic mushroom.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: He says somebody
ate a magic mushroom.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
whether-- it's a theory,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:90%
and it's a legitimate theory.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.734 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that the
relationship between mankind,

00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:16.150 align:middle line:84%
the development of mankind,
civilization and the mushroom,

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:90%
is inextricably connected.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as health
goes-- now you've

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
got to be careful because
they're medicinal,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.015 align:middle line:90%
so they will also be toxic.

00:30:23.015 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of mushrooms--
mushrooms can kill you.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.766 align:middle line:84%
However, from a healing
and therapeutic standpoint,

00:30:29.766 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to come up
with a food that's

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
got more medicinal
value than a mushroom.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
For fighting cancer,
for helping your heart,

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
helping your cholesterol
levels, for your skin.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:84%
You can crush up mushrooms,
make mushroom powder,

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:90%
and use a mushroom mask.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.104 align:middle line:84%
For your digestive tract,
unbelievably important.

00:30:45.104 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
earlier about power foods.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Super low calorie.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Super high nutritional
value, especially,

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
by the way-- what
do you think of when

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:90%
you squeeze the mushroom?

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.575 align:middle line:90%
It's like a joint.

00:30:56.575 --> 00:30:57.752 align:middle line:90%
It's like cartilage.

00:30:57.752 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Especially for your
joints and for your--

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.956 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:31:01.956 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Speaking of--

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hyaluronic.

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Very nice.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it for?

00:31:07.045 --> 00:31:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Everything.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you have
connective tissue,

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:84%
you will benefit
from hyaluronic acid.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.660 align:middle line:90%
You ever see the body's exhibit?

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We used to inject
them in horses that were sore.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.379 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: For the joints.

00:31:18.379 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:90%
That's connective tissue.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Women will put it in
their face for wrinkles.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:90%
It's connective tissue.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.026 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen the
bodies exhibits?

00:31:24.026 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like Botox?

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Botox is a bacteria--

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's more
like-- it's a paralyzer.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a toxin from botulism.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd rather
use that, right?

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Heck yes.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about nutrition
is it's not instant.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.145 align:middle line:84%
That's the one
downside on nutrition.

00:31:36.145 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It takes time.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:90%
You've got to build it up.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.263 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It takes a certain
amount of time for building.

00:31:40.263 --> 00:31:41.030 align:middle line:90%
A couple weeks.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.722 align:middle line:90%
Not a long time.

00:31:41.722 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But once you're in
the system, once you're there--

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.221 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's on its own.

00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:90%
A perpetual motion machine.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.305 align:middle line:84%
So you ever see
the Bodies Exhibit?

00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So you see all
these flesh things--

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just hope I
never become one of the--

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.616 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I know.

00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even wants
to think about it.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.681 align:middle line:84%
Well, nobody wants
to think about it,

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:90%
but that's what we are.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Underneath this mask of skin,
we are just this tissue.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Steak.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.747 align:middle line:90%
Beef.

00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, that beef is
called connective tissue.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.788 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a blend of
connective tissue and muscle

00:32:07.788 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
tissue.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's the vast
majority of our body.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:90%
80% of our body is this stuff.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
If you could figure out a way
to eat food or take supplements

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that help your body build that
beef to make you stronger,

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.740 align:middle line:90%
you won't get prolapses.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:90%
You won't get hernias.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:90%
You won't get osteoporosis.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.756 align:middle line:90%
You won't get arthritis.

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:25.880 align:middle line:90%
You won't be hunched over--

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your brain
will be in function.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.362 align:middle line:90%
You won't lose your memory.

00:32:29.362 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, what
I'm thinking of

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.740 align:middle line:84%
is the tissue, the
beef part of us.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.910 align:middle line:84%
We want to understand how
to build our beef if we

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:90%
want to be anti-aging.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we see those
bodies exhibit,

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a big, thick,
robust body, rather than

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:90%
a little shriveled up one.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
What makes your grandmother look
different from a little child

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.766 align:middle line:84%
is that her connective
tissue is shriveling.

00:32:50.766 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
aging's about-- shriveling

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:90%
connective tissue.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, hyaluronic
acid is-- if not

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
the key component in
connective tissue--

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the key components
in connective tissue.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And that means when supplement
with hyaluronic acid,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:90%
your connective tissue expands.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
That means your body's
frame gets bigger.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
That means your skin is plumper.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
That means your bones are
stronger and more robust.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.371 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just have that
look, that shine about you.

00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: You look powerful
and robust, like a baby,

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.940 align:middle line:10%
even if you're 60
or 70 years old.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
love hyaluronic.
