00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN HANSEN: When you've
been in locations where things

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.960 align:middle line:84%
are flying off the wall, where
you've seen people's eyes, kind

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of, roll back into
their head, you

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
understand that you could
be playing with fire.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: I'm saying how
did this FBI guy get this show?

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does anything
scare you about?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Marriage
used to scare me.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a pair of pants,
walking across someone's lawn,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and what is it?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
With ET disclosure, we're
dealing with something

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:90%
that is psychological.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
reality shifts.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.852 align:middle line:84%
What happens if it happens
on a Friday afternoon?

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:41.935 align:middle line:84%
I call this the ripping
off the Band-Aid approach.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Ben Hansen with us, is a
paranormal and UFO researcher,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:10%
who lectures on many topics,
including the global impact

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:10%
of UFO disclosure.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
He's also the television host
of "UFO Witness" on the Travel

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Channel and Discovery Plus.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Ben, welcome to the program.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Thanks, George.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you again.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're looking
good these days.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Well, thank you.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new?

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: A lot.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the UFO world,
of course, is exploding.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Media,
government disclosure,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
congressional hearings.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I've seemed to kind of find
myself in the middle of it

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were an FBI agent.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in investigating UFOs?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Are you Fox Mulder?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: Well, I can say
that what I was doing,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
there had nothing to do with
the UFO or paranormal subjects.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.985 align:middle line:84%
Before I went in there, I was
investigating child sex crimes.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:40.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not easy.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of--

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not a happy topic.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what my specialty
was and being picked up.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
But I could say, it was good.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, it wasn't
quite what I expected.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I made the
transition, I didn't

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:90%
expect to go into TV at all.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was going looking
at law school and other things,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and a TV show idea
was presented to me.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
a concept, though.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
They loved the--

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
loved you, but they

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how to put
you into something, right?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Exactly.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was unique because
I was able to start

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, help
them develop the concept.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And we created the
show "Fact or Faked,"

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.848 align:middle line:90%
which ran for three seasons.

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it was a well
done show, by the way.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Well, thank you.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was a little
envious when I first

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
saw you do that because you
were a guest on our coast

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:90%
to coast radio show.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, how did
this FBI guy get this show?

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But you did a great job,
and you're doing a great job

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
with the Travel Channel.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Well, thank you.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It's been fun.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been lucky,
I guess, to have

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
so many three actual
full series, everything

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
from ghost hunting to, now,
"UFO Witness," which is--

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beautiful.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: --talking
to UFO witnesses.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.587 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
gist of the concept.

00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
are many out there.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: There's a lot.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think people now are
seeing that the stigma is

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
being removed.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
government telling

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
the military and pilots
and such that, hey,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to come forward.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would say, if I
get back to the hotel now,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I've probably got a
dozen new messages

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
of people wanting to
tell me their story

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.897 align:middle line:90%
and send me videos and photos.

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: New people?

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: New people.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:90%
From all walks of life.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get many
calls from military, still?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I have had several
emails lately of people.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've got a couple
of people who are telling me,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
over in the UK, for
example, that they

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:90%
signed a nondisclosure.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed to talk
about this, but they want to.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.608 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
hey, I don't want

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
you to violate anything you're
not supposed to talk about.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But they're feeling
like it's OK now.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:90%
They want to come forward.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
to come forward.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.905 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: They've seen
things on deployments.

00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They've been overseas
and had triangular craft

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
or other craft, like
following their platoon.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's
finally becoming OK.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Congress
is, hopefully, going

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to pass a stipulation in the
new Authorization Act that

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
will allow whistleblowers, so to
speak, to come forward and not

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.232 align:middle line:84%
have any form of
reprisal against them.

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you always been
interested in the paranormal,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.830 align:middle line:90%
even when you were an FBI agent?

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yes.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.315 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in college,
it was well before

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
going to work for
the government, where

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I had my first experience
and tape recorder

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:90%
cemetery caught an EVP.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Full sentence.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.185 align:middle line:84%
It made me really think
there's something to this.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It's technology, I
think, is catching up.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.432 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily that I
believed in life after death.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I believed in life
in other worlds.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
we have now is

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
starting to be able
to witness for us

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:90%
and capture the evidence.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
John de Souza been
on the program

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
before and talked with us
about his investigations

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.777 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal and what
made him decide to do this.

00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN DE SOUZA: I
became an FBI agent

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
because of my
paranormal experiences

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:10%
before I even joined the FBI.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, I
had several experiences

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:10%
of contact observation
experiences

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:10%
with the UFOs and other
things of that nature.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And that awoken me a
desire to really go further

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
into becoming a professional
investigator to find out

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
think, as an FBI agent,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be able to
uncover these kinds of stories?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DE SOUZA: I really did.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And once I got
there, I found out

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
lot of work being

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
done on paranormal
themes, on UFOs,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
on many areas of the
paranormal, supernatural

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about today.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you stumble
across the real "X-files?"

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DE SOUZA: I feel like I did.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of those
cases are actually

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:10%
available for people to look at
today at vault.fbi.gov, where

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:10%
there's a giant tab that
says, unexplained phenomena.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:10%
And people can go look
at the cases that,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:10%
over the last 60, 70 years,
have been declassified

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.137 align:middle line:10%
and are available for
anyone to look at.

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's interesting.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
My career took the
same kind of path

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
as yours, where, when
I was a young kid,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to investigate
all these weird stories

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and paranormal mysteries.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, the best
way to do that was to be,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
not an FBI agent,
but a broadcaster.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:90%
So I went in this field as well.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're no
longer an FBI agent,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
but you're still
investigating the paranormal.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you give that up?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DE SOUZA: Because when
I left the FBI in 2013,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted to keep
investigating areas that needed

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
investigation because
they had so much deception

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and cover in them.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around at politics,
economics, other areas,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but the paranormal, apparently,
has so much deception and cover

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that is involved with
this area, that I just

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
thought, this is where they need
an investigator to penetrate

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
these truths, to
pierce this veil,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and to get to what's
really going on underneath.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, we've got to get
your path to cross with John's.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.317 align:middle line:84%
You guys are very
similar in nature.

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I didn't realize that.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I've seen him at conferences,
and it sounds cliche,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually
the "X-files"

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
TV show that was popular
during high school, for me,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that I thought, I know the
"X-files" is not what they say.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't probably
exist, but it spurred me

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:90%
towards that path.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you find any
secret files within the FBI

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:90%
that you can talk about?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: No, I didn't.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems like he has a lot more
experience in getting into that

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and seeing.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I do know, like he said,
there are public files,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
even back to the
cattle mutilations

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were heavily
involved in investigating.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has your FBI
experience helped you

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:90%
as a UFO investigator?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I think so.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, with the
interviewing process

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and putting a case together
from beginning to end.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it gives you more
credibility, too, I think.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Well, thank you.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.303 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't necessarily
disagree with that.

00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I do think, though,
that some people put

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
so much emphasis on--

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
you hear the term a professional
observer, for example.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: When
you see an object,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
well, you're not trained to
observe things professionally,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
or you're not in
this career path.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a misnomer
because the average citizen can

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference
between the planet Jupiter

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.810 align:middle line:84%
or a large craft hovering
over your backyard.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
You would think so.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
You would think.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
need to be careful

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that we don't discount
what the average person can

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
do in investigating these things
without a credential like that.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you enjoy
investigating these cases?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I do.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I never get tired of it.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just like when you
think you've seen it all

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and done it all, then
something comes along

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that just can really
blow your mind.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your ability as
an FBI agent enhance your UFO

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:90%
investigating?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I think,
certainly, in the way

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of learning how to ask
questions and to start

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
a case from beginning
to end, for sure.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
took a personal interest

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
was in deception
detection, trying

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to find out if that person is
actually telling the truth,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
embellishing.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.795 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I sit down
now, I get feedback

00:09:27.795 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of people.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
They feel that I'm very open.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm easy to talk to, and
they'll share things with you.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, you don't
pass judgment on them.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:90%
You got to hear the whole story.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Do they know you
were an FBI agent?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: A lot of people do.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I think because I've been
on TV quite a bit now.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
If they look me up, they
can see my background.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can
see your background.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But other times,
they might just think

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that I'm some sort of an actor
or something, which I'm not.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm horrible at acting.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not Brendan Fraser.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I've been
accused of that.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But just to sit down with
anyone from all walks of life,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to hear their story,
what I will say,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
some of these
abductions, they relate

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
very similar to some awful,
horrific, sexual crimes

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:90%
that I've investigated, like--

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: --PTSD issues.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
That you can see
that the person is

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
genuinely afraid and
experiencing something

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
like a sexual assault. And
so, when someone comes to me

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and says, oh, well, this
so-and-so person made this

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
all up, I, sometimes, really
have to disagree and say, look,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
we don't know exactly
what may have happened,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can look at
the emotional impact

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:90%
of this person.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it was--

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you know something
has happened to this person.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Exactly.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Something has severely
traumatized them.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often are people
coming to you now with,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
as you were talking
about, different leads?

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Is this ongoing?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: It's constant.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's constant.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I put up a website
related to the TV show,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and people go there.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
They go to my social
media outlets.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And I try to answer everybody,
but what they want me to do,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, is confirm, hey, this
photo I took, is this a portal?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Is this a vortex?

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it not orb?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.733 align:middle line:84%
And there's not much reference,
sometimes, in the photo.

00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult. I don't
charge anybody for it.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
be the expert, right?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
It can be overwhelming
sometimes.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in ghost hunting, as

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:90%
well as UFO hunting?

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Well, the ghost
hunting started in college,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and it was when "Ghost Hunters,"
the TV show, was not even on.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.965 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there were these
groups recording these EVPs.

00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And they put them on
the radio and play them.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, anyone
could make that up.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So I said come on, guys.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I took my friends, and
we went to a cemetery.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's Halloween.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Started recording.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Went home, played back
two of our recorders

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and captured a voice.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: There it was.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it say?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.935 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: It said get brother.

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get brother?

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: And I was
with my two sisters,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and it whispered
into the microphone.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that voice
wasn't there before.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, there's
something to this.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I think our
technology is starting

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.958 align:middle line:84%
to catch up and be able to
record some of these things.

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know the folks
at the Hollywood Ghost Hunters

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:90%
by any chance?

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.247 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I do.

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Yep, I've seen them.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rick McCallum
and those people.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Good people.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: They are.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've been on our
show a lot, our radio show.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.692 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: They've
got a lot of access

00:12:44.692 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to some really cool
places up there in LA.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does anything
scare you, Ben?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Marriage
used to scare me.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been married
now for over 6 years.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the paranormal
world, I think

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that I try to stay away from
anything that seems demonic

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:90%
because that is very real.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
places that I've

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
been to, such as around
Skinwalker Ranch--

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
make you uncomfortable?

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Yeah,
because there might

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
be rules on the other side,
but we don't maybe, perhaps,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:90%
understand all the rules.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you've
been in locations

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
where things are flying
off the wall, where you've

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
seen people's eyes roll
back into their head

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and go into a trance,
you understand

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that you could be playing
with fire if you don't

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:90%
know what you're dealing with.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
stumbled across some Bigfoot

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:90%
stories, too, haven't you?

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I have, both
on and off the air.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And Bigfoot is one
that I have not

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
had my own personal
experience other than being

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.485 align:middle line:84%
on a little
expedition in Arizona,

00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
where in the middle
of the night,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
we were awakened and recorded
a very, I should say,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:90%
primal type of a scream.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
It didn't sound human, and
it echoed through the forest.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had my night
vision and open up

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
the bottom slit of the tent to
look out with a night vision.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little peering, right?

00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Looked around
and didn't see anything,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
but there's been numerous
sightings in this area

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.415 align:middle line:84%
that, I think, there is
something to that phenomenon.

00:14:19.415 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: There definitely is.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been your
favorite paranormal anomaly

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
story?

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: I really
like the very unusual,

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:10%
the ones that Stan
Friedman used to say,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:10%
put it in your grey box.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:10%
You don't know
what to do with it.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: Right?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We miss him.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: We sure do.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
we investigated on TV show

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:10%
was up in Fresno, and it's
called the nightcrawlers.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:90%
We called it that.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.938 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Well, think
of a pair of pants,

00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:90%
walking across someone's lawn.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without a body?

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.127 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Without a body,
without upper torso.

00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:58.465 align:middle line:90%
You just had the pair of pants.

00:14:58.465 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just the pants.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: And you
would have to think,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
either this person CGI'd
this, which wasn't likely.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
They were not technical
in that aspect.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Or they actually captured
something so unusual

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
on their DVR, which is
hard, actually, to import.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And what is it?

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it interdimensional?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it ghost?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it alien?

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Why does it look like this?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So those types of cases
that, really, you've

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:84%
never heard of before, you've
never heard a context for it,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.463 align:middle line:90%
those ones really perplex me.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell
you interesting story

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:90%
about Stanton Friedman.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:90%
You'll really enjoy this.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Back in Detroit,
I'm 21 years old.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm a radio reporter.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:90%
He's my first radio interview.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw a little clipping in
the Detroit News that said,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:84%
UFOlogist and nuclear
physicists Stanton Friedman is

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
coming to speak to a
university about UFOs.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.197 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to cover it.

00:15:56.197 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:84%
My news director said, George,
you're not going to cover that.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to spend
over time for you on that.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going
to do it on my own.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
He was my first interview,
and we stayed close

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:90%
over all these years.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Wow.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then, we had
him live at a live event,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I did Columbus, Ohio on
Mother's Day several years ago.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
He was on the stage with me.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.267 align:middle line:84%
And he died going back to
the airport in Toronto.

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Oh, it was your event?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was my event.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So he was my first
radio interview.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I was the last person
to interview him.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
You talk about fate.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: What a great mind, one
of the few that have dedicated

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.838 align:middle line:90%
a large part of their life--

00:16:38.838 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he loved it.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: --to this subject.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He loved it.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Absolutely.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Guy has
got a program called

00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
a unified theory
of the paranormal,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and they discuss all the things
about the paranormal phenomena.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:90%
You'll like this.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: Could there
be a common cause that

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:90%
explains all paranormal events?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
sustained paranormal experiences

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:90%
is the Mothman incident of 1966.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
For 13 months, Point
Pleasant West Virginia

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
was plagued with sightings
of a bizarre winged humanoid,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by mysterious
lights in the sky, animal

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, and other accounts
of paranormal activity.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Journalist John Keel
famously documented

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
this prolonged period
of unusual events

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
in his book, "The
Mothman Prophecies,"

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
which was later made into
a film of the same name.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
These simultaneous events
were not new to Keel.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
He often wrote of window
areas, specific locations

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, where
paranormal events,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
where, far more likely and
even expected, to occur.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:84%
For experiences and
believers of the paranormal,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
the greatest frustration
often lies in the lack

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:90%
of abundant physical evidence.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
A few landing marks
here, a bit of fur

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
there, and even the
occasional photograph

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be enough
to convince the skeptics.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
After decades of
researching such cases,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Keel developed an
elegant hypothesis,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
which explains the
troublesome disparity

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
between excessive testimony
and scarce physical evidence.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
His book, "The Eighth Tower,"
written at the same time

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
as "The Mothman
Prophecies," proposes

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
a sort of unified theory to
explain all paranormal events.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:84%
These entities are able
to shift up and down

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic spectrum,
appearing and disappearing

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:90%
as they please.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:10%
Keel called this
the superspectrum,

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:10%
and he referred to the
beings inhabiting it

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:10%
as ultraterrestrials.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:10%
This could explain the variety
of electromagnetic effects

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:10%
often associated with
paranormal events.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Cars stall, widespread
power outages

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
occur, radios and
telephones go crazy,

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and battery-operated
devices refuse to work.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Clocks and watches
have also been

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
known to stop in the presence
of UFOs, monsters, and ghosts.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Keel believes these beings
are native to the Earth, which

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
explains their manifestation
in different forms

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
ages, but that they

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
inhabit physical dimensions
beyond normal human perception.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
This theory fits with
scientific understandings

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of how our brains perceive
the world around us.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It is well known that our
senses are only equipped

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to pick up a very small
slice of physical activity.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John Keel is amazing.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I need to read that
book, it looks like.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's done a great
job of this field of UFOlogy

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:90%
to be sure.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.647 align:middle line:84%
I often think about
the unified theories

00:19:31.647 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because we have these hotspot
areas, like he discussed,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Skinwalker Ranch.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Marley Woods, there's
a number of rural areas

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
where it seems like
everything happens.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
weird about that area.

00:19:45.365 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Definitely.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
you can, in one day,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:84%
literally have a
UFO sighting, you

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
can have something
poltergeist, you know,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.305 align:middle line:90%
and an animal mutilation.

00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It keeps changing.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
As you investigate
UFOs, you have

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
said that many sightings are,
by large, bodies of water.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: So there's
a lot of research

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that several different
groups have put together.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem that our
coastal areas and lakes,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
large lakes, there's an
inordinate number of sightings.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we look at what
the government is now releasing,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:90%
these Navy videos.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Both East and West
Coast, and you

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
talk to the people involved,
the radar images, for example,

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in the Nimitz case, we
have a hot spot right

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of
California, where

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Catalina Island, all the way
down to Guadalupe in Mexico--

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a hot spot.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: A hot spot
of something going on.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to so many
different witnesses, who

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
have witnessed objects coming
up and going into the water,

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
both on that side and
then over on the East

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Coast, similar things,
including triangles.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to
be some attraction

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to the water from the
objects, whether they're

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
using it to sound strange,
but as a base, maybe

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
something under the water.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Could be.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Or maybe
they're exploring

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
some of the marine life or
some attraction to the area.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say the
percentage of the authenticity

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
might be on the
cases you look at?

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I would say--

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I rely on what Project Blue
Book assessed was that about 95%

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
of all of, let's
say, UFO cases, have

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
some natural explanation, or
misidentification, or a hoax.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's
5% that aren't.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: There are those 5%.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:10%
And when people send
me videos and things,

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:10%
they're often discouraged
when I can easily tell them

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:10%
what was going on in the photo.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you do that, and you're
diligent with it, what's left

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.853 align:middle line:90%
is the gold.

00:21:57.853 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.647 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right?

00:21:59.647 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All you
need-- for example, I

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
used to tell Linda Moulton Howe
about crop formation stories.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about how so
many of them have been doctored,

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
made by man.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, but, Linda, all you
need is one that wasn't.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
She says, you're
absolutely right.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yep.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And we think in binary terms.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I think people want to throw
the baby out with the bathwater,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
They say, it's either
this way, or it's not.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the same thing with
people, sometimes, who

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
become the greatest hoaxers.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I found that, eventually, there
was something in their life,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of them had a
very legitimate experience.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.598 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: And then they
got into fame or money,

00:22:40.598 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and they started inventing
and embellishing things.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
is your most interesting case

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:90%
that you've dealt with?

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Oh, so many, so many.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's hard
to pick one, is it?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: You choose a subject.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So UFOs, or Bigfoot,
or paranormal, and I

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:90%
could tell those.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: UFOs.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: UFOs.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
We had a case in the
UK, where a woman

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
felt as though she had seen
an object across the field

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:90%
from her kitchen window.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It was hovering.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
She went to bed, had
the typical abduction

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
scenario, very surreal, what
she thought was a dream.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But she was so horrified by it,
that she woke up the next day,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and she eventually tied a string
from her hand to her husband

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
so that he would wake
up if she was taken.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
He said, look--

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
play pull them.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.465 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Like, pulled out.

00:23:36.465 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pulled out of bed.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, this
is really concerning.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we set
up a video camera?

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So he set up a video
in a room, let it run.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.848 align:middle line:84%
Couple of days or weeks
went by, I can't remember,

00:23:48.848 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:90%
and one day, she woke up.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think
something happened.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.308 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
got to go to work.

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
You review the tape.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
On the video, you see
her form in the bed,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:90%
and she's underneath the sheets.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:90%
She moves around.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the sheets
look like they dissolved.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally flatten out--

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Melt away?

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.072 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: --and she's gone.

00:24:11.072 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, about 13
minutes passes--

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is she still there.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: She's still there.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
13 minutes goes by in the
film and, all of a sudden,

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:90%
the sheets take form again--

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she's back.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: She turns
around and is back.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't fake
that on a security camera.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: It's very
difficult with DVR.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we went
to JPL, who NASA

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
contracts for analyzing
these types of videos

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:90%
for authenticity.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:90%
No indication of manipulation.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was either the
most strange illusion

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
you've ever seen, or something
really happened, and we

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
have to keep the possibility
open that she disappeared.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.023 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your gut tell you?

00:24:53.023 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: She's
telling the truth.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Her husband and
she, I don't think,

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
are involved in any type of
hoax as to what happened.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be the
strangest illusion ever.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.597 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: We may have actually
caught something on camera,

00:25:06.597 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:90%
where somebody dematerializes.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people are
going through abduction cases

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and scenarios like that,
and they're not lying.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
They may not know exactly
what's happening to them.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But whatever they're saying,
they believe it to be true.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.198 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: And in fact,
J. Allen Hynek, I think,

00:25:29.198 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first
serious researchers

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to popularize the idea that
you can interview someone.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:84%
You can fully believe
they're telling the truth

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and, yet, not conclude
that they were

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
taken by such and
such extraterrestrial.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:90%
The reality is intact.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reality of what
they're telling you

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.538 align:middle line:90%
is true, as they perceived it.

00:25:51.538 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that's
as far as you can go.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
that they be believed.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
personal experiences

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that you've gone through,
do you feel for the subject

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:90%
matter of the people?

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you sometimes
feel sorry for them?

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I do, quite often.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
As you had mentioned, sometimes
there is a prosaic explanation.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course,
is a higher level

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of people suffering
mental health problems.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of them latch
on to an abduction

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:84%
scenario or something, or it
actually could have happened.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But the feelings are real,
and they're plagued by it.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people who have had
tremendous physical ailments,

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
losing substantial
weight, becoming very ill,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
being hospitalized, stigmatized,
of course, from their friends

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and family because
of what's happened.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, do you come
across an implant case?

00:26:49.103 --> 00:26:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Quite often.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
weird, aren't they?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: And since
Dr. Roger Leir left us,

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to find someone
to take his place.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%
He was the best.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right?

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
He looked at it
from a perspective

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
of not only removing
the objects,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
but trying to figure out where
they're transmitting signals.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:84%
He'd had enough that he really
dialed in some patterns there.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
across them, it's

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
hard to find
doctors who operate.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's also difficult
because some of them

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
are in locations--

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman, had one
right behind her ear.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are not
going to touch that.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
She's elderly and
having a surgery.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
That would be very,
very dangerous.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Paola Harris, one of the
great UFO investigators,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Italian-American
investigator, was

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia's "Open Minds,"
talking about the methods

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.748 align:middle line:90%
she uses to investigate.

00:27:41.748 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: I
decided to interview him,

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:90%
had him come to my home.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But any time I interview
and every time I do a story,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I usually--

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
just think of me
as the "X-files."

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to pull in a Mulder
because I'm either nervous,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:90%
or I want to--

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's good to run
information by someone

00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:90%
else who's working with you.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Antonello Lupino,
who worked for the Customs.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
He was a Custom Police
Officer, and he was

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:90%
with me-- and also ufologists.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was with me
during the interview.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.578 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what
the story was--

00:28:12.578 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Why
were you nervous doing it?

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
when I film people,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.278 align:middle line:84%
and they're whistleblowers--
a whistleblower.

00:28:20.278 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: OK, I
think this is going

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to be revealed at the
end of this story.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.578 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, a
whistleblower is--

00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: They're vulnerable.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.078 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're vulnerable.

00:28:28.078 --> 00:28:29.687 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they're telling
state secrets.

00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%
So it can be dangerous.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It can
be very dangerous.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: So go ahead.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So you start.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I wanted
to get him on camera.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:90%
So Antonello brought the camera.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
We set it up in my
living room in Rome,

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and the apartment was
on the seventh floor.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we started the cameras
rolling, and what he said

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
was that he was part of
a group of officers--

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
not officers-- of military,
who are doing the testing

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Bikini Atoll.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.458 align:middle line:84%
I think it was New
Zealand that stopped all

00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that because the
journalists knew about it,

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and they went after them.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And this caused the killing
of all the coral, the fish.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, there were three feet
of dead fish on the runway.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And three feet of
dead fish because it

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
was done in the water,
not to hurt anybody.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But good grief, I mean,
the oceans are alive.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, on two
occasions, he personally

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
saw a flyover of three
UFOs, on two occasions.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, he
jumped in the plane

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to go after them
with other people.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And that the plane's whole
navigation system shut down,

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and they thought they
were going to crash.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
When the UFOs went
over the horizon, then

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
all the navigation
system came back online.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if they
were dangerous--

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:84%
this is the point I
want to make to people.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:84%
If they were out to
kill us, and they're

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
watching this
craziness, they would

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
have done something instead
of just present themselves

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:90%
and, say, here we are.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:90%
We're watching your insanity.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's right.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:90%
She's right.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they seriously
wanted to harm us,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.383 align:middle line:84%
they would have done
it a long time ago.

00:30:14.383 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: They've certainly
had the chance to.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's nothing
we can do to stop it, Ben.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: No.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
No, we have to assume that
they're supremely intelligent

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and have technology
far beyond ours.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the idea
that they may not be just,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
of course, one
species, but they all

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.098 align:middle line:90%
might have different agendas.

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:34.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:34.898 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: So some
might be malevolent,

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and some might be
trying to help us.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
handle the truth?

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: That is a very
interesting question.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel like Jack
Nicholson on "A Few Good Men."

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Recently,
I am finishing up

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:90%
my master's degree.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what--

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Emergency and
disaster management.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yeah, at Georgetown.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great school.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I convinced
them, actually,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to let me do my thesis on
something that I call reality

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:90%
compromising events.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So for the past six
months or so, I've

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
been working on this very
idea that the government,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
from, at least, the
late 1940s until now,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
has had their own kind
of paradigm and thing

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:84%
they've been working
through on, should we

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.222 align:middle line:90%
release the info or not?

00:31:25.222 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
you're right, too.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right?

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're here and we've
got congressional hearings

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
on it, but can we
handle the truth?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:90%
The short answer is it depends.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And my research basically
led me to believe

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that there have to be certain
things that would fall in line,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's not all dependent
on the crisis planners.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think most people,
Ben, would say, I knew it.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.185 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: They might.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:90%
They might say that.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
However, let me put it this way,
we learned a lot from COVID-19,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot about how people react
under stress and crisis, right?

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there's
a threshold point.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take
the majority of people

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to panic in order
for us to be thrown

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:90%
into a worldwide catastrophe.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It only takes a certain
number of people.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.233 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we
saw people panic buying,

00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:84%
they're buying up toilet
paper and everything.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like crazy.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Everything is off the shelves.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Right.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, not to get too far
into this, but the theory

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is what we call
social amplification

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of risk and some other things.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It happens that people,
they see others doing it,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:84%
we get our media news
sources from social media now

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and informal
channels and whatnot.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So what could be
something as simple

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:84%
as like just using your own
common sense becomes amplified,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and you see--

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say,
they had a shooting

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
when ET disclosure is made
and if someone goes out

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and creates an act of
violence in public.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's supply
chain problems.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, nobody feels
safe to go to work.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Nobody feels safe to
go out to the stores.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And we end up in
something much worse

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:90%
than what happened during COVID.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:90%
So do I think we can handle it?

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I think most individuals
probably can,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:84%
but what happens in society,
as a whole, if we don't

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:84%
control how that information is
distributed and how it happens.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We could be headed for
a very bad situation.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
the mainstream media

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
is starting to accept this?

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Absolutely,
and it's wonderful.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to
turn on the news

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and see mainstream
media without chuckling

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to see senators
and Congress people

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
actually bringing forth
funding and demanding hearings.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I think, for the most part--

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's just tremendous.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: --it's a
great time to be alive.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to your
thesis for a moment.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
They are prepared
to accept this?

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Well, the media, I
think, plays along with it.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:90%
The bottom line is profit.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
if something is--

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And ratings.

00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:09.639 align:middle line:90%
Ratings mean profit.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.847 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Ratings and profit.

00:34:10.847 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
If you can scare
people or provide them

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:84%
good information,
whatever it is,

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that's what they're
concerned about.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:22.179 align:middle line:84%
So what the government needs to
do is have a contingency plan.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my research, I
went to FEMA headquarters.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
I talked with a lot of
people on the inside.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:84%
They do not have, officially,
a contingency plan

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:90%
specific to ET disclosure.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The closest thing we
have is looking at,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:90%
for example, an asteroid strike.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And they do these
tabletop exercises.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:90%
They run everyone through it.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
How should we get
people together?

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.422 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's not if.

00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:49.555 align:middle line:90%
It's when.

00:34:49.555 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: It's when.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line
is, with ET Disclosure,

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with something
that is psychological.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
reality shifts.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
never considered this.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go
through some major changes.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of disclosure, Ben,

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.730 align:middle line:84%
are we going to ever really
see it in our lifetime?

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: I'm optimistic,
but a number of researchers

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.438 align:middle line:84%
who will tweet out,
and they'll say it's

00:35:18.438 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:90%
happening in a couple of weeks.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's happening in
a couple of months.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I really have to
take a step back

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, we've got to
see some major things happen

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:90%
before that takes place.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our dear friend Richard
Dolan was on the program,

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.810 align:middle line:84%
talking about disclosure
and the mainstream media.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: And then,
suddenly, in 2017, many things

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:90%
began to change.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think it culminated
with the phenomenal coverage

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that we got in the
mainstream media, "New York

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Times" and Politico at
the end of the year.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:50.906 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, huge.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think it
shocked everyone.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.060 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:84%
My short answer, I guess,
is that maybe history

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:90%
is speeding up a little bit.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
The long answer, I'm still
trying to work that one out.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
we're in an era, where

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
more and more toothpaste
is coming out of that tube.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And I ask myself, when
will we get to a point

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
where it becomes an undeniable
momentum on its own?

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're heading
into that already.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Steve Bassett from
the Paradigm Research Group

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
has been pushing for government
disclosure on UFOs for years.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm at odds with Steven.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I love the guy, but
I've always told him,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.050 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
come from government.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.762 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I go back
and forth on this.

00:36:30.762 --> 00:36:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
I wouldn't expect

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:84%
an honest voluntary disclosure
from a government source.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
about it, I don't even

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.280 align:middle line:90%
know if it's possible to be.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And I really wonder about this.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:84%
How much information does
the government really

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:52.360 align:middle line:84%
have as compared with, maybe,
privatized, highly secret

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:90%
compartmented organizations?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
I do agree with you

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that I've never
expected any government

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to have a motivation to want
to get in front of this.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And like you, I've
argued with Steve.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Steve is a friend of
mine, and our arguments

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
go back more than 15,
almost 20 years on this.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
He would say, well,
it's going to happen.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:84%
He said that in
George W. Bush years.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
He said it during
the Obama years.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I've just never been on board.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's put together some
great conferences and events.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which would
illustrate what

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:84%
would happen if
disclosure occurred,

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's just not
coming for government.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
If it happens,
it's going to come

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:90%
from organizations, groups.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan's a great
investigator, Ben.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: He is, and I love
Dolan and Bryce Zabel's book

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that talks about disclosure
because they bring up

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:90%
some very important points.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:84%
One of those is,
what happens if it

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:90%
happens on a Friday afternoon?

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The White House comes out and
declares everything they know.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I call this the ripping
off the Band-Aid approach.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:84%
That would be probably
the most intense.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Because now we've
got to assimilate

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:84%
all this information, and
you have a government who

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.450 align:middle line:90%
has to admit one of two things.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they
either have to admit

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that they know as little
about it as we do,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:90%
and they know nothing.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.163 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: Or that
they do, and they've

00:38:18.163 --> 00:38:20.095 align:middle line:90%
been lying to us, right?

00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't want to
say they've been lying to us.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: No, it's
a no-win situation.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those are
good messages to communicate.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they'll come
up with scenario number three,

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and that is, this has been going
on since the beginning of time,

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
but we quite didn't understand
how to present it to you,

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.010 align:middle line:90%
so we had to hold back.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Yes.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would be
the best mitigating strategy,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I think if they were to come out
in what we call the slow drip

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and maybe give us, for example,
talk about Roswell and say,

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.725 align:middle line:90%
yes, Roswell happened.

00:38:57.725 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It was extraterrestrial,
and then

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
don't say anything for
another six months or a year.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, release
something else.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.760 align:middle line:90%
But you could shift the blame.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:84%
You could say, those
were other times.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We were afraid of panic,
and we were doing the best

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:90%
that we knew.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think you could exonerate
some of our current leaders

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:84%
because they knew nothing
about those times.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Several people
disappear off the face

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth every year.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where they are.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Sure, some of them may have been
murdered, but not that many.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:90%
They've disappeared.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
What if the ETs are taking
people, taking humans, and just

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:90%
not bringing them back?

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: It reminds me
of my favorite UFO movie,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.250 align:middle line:90%
"Close Encounters," right?

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup, I love it.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: And down
comes the mothership,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and all the people that have
been taken start coming out.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:90%
We find out where they've been.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:90%
It is very mysterious.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these
aren't coming back.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: If they
never come back,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and we never find the
remains, then, I'd say,

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.860 align:middle line:84%
someone has a lot
of explaining to do,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
especially if there's any
truth to the fact that--

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and these, to me, are
just rumors at this point,

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:84%
but has our government
made any a treaty?

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.623 align:middle line:84%
Have they been part of
allowing this to happen?

00:40:16.623 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
that's another reason

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.910 align:middle line:90%
why they can't tell us.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they know
what's happening,

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.390 align:middle line:90%
and they can't say it.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What do you think--
what kind of panic

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:84%
do you think there would be if
government came out and said,

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials are real.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They've been visiting
the planet since you've

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:90%
been here on the planet.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking humans
for whatever reason.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:90%
We eat them.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:90%
The world would go nuts.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: It would.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, my thesis, the
research I've been doing,

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:90%
shows why that would happen.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:84%
All of the current research
on panic and human behavior

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
says there's a
couple of elements.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.390 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, when you
have a lack of ability

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to give your consent
to something.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So the voluntariness
of the event.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.684 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:05.684 --> 00:41:06.484 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:41:06.484 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSEN: If it's
not voluntary, then

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
we tend to feel like the
risk is more elevated, right?

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And another thing would be how
quickly that information comes

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.800 align:middle line:84%
out, how intense it is,
and how unfamiliar we

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:90%
are with the risk.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is something most
people don't really think about.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:10%
But if you came out and
told me, yeah, people

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:10%
have been abducted, horrible
things have been done,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:10%
where can you go to turn for
help or to run away from it?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.485 align:middle line:90%
s That's very intense.

00:41:40.485 --> 00:41:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, how do
people get a hold of you

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:90%
and track your work?

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: I have my website.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It's just benhansen.com.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell it.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: H-A-N-S-E-N--

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSEN: --.com.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And I keep that updated
with events that I'm doing

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:10%
and TV shows.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And there's also a place there.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You can find links
to my social media,

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.263 align:middle line:84%
if you want to submit
your video or photo,

00:42:04.263 --> 00:42:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and we'll take a look at it.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks, and
keep doing what you're doing.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSEN: Thank you, George.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Former FBI agent, who
has turned his career

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:84%
into investigating the
paranormal and the unusual--

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.760 align:middle line:90%
UFOs, ghosts, Bigfoot.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:90%
He does it all.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.440 align:middle line:10%
And one day, because of
people like Ben Hansen,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:10%
we'll get the answers
we've been looking for.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
