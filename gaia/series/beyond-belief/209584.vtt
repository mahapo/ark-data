12, you understood

what you were looking at?

it was not normal.

If an African American
person would have seen a UFO,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.357 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to walk into
the local police station.

This is not something
you're just going to make up

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
only were we an
interracial couple,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
but let's bring something
else into the mix.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we were abducted.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:84%

rabbit hole that we

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%

>>MARTIN: Glad to
be here, George.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And why the big secret?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.615 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Because there is
a secret, plain and simple.

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the secret?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: We don't know.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:10%
But I think if we start
asking the question why,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:10%
we get past the narrative
that's put out there, right?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:10%
Because I think everybody knows
what most of the secrets are,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
but we really don't know
why it's a big secret.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We all are
interested in UFOs.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just baffled
by what happens.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:90%
How'd you get interested?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, it all started
when I was 12 years old.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, probably before that.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 12
years old in Dallas,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
one evening I was about
to come into the house

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
because that's when my mom
flicks the porch light.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the signal.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like, get in, Rod.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Get in.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's in
the corner over there.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I was lagging
that night, that evening.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.033 align:middle line:84%
So it's right when
the stars was just--

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you know how it meets
and you just kind of see

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
the stars a little bit?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked
up, and there it was.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a white object,
just like a disk.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't say it was
a disk, but it was white.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And behind it was two
jets following it.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it came back
and then they came back.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And it went back.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It all happened within
about a minute, you know?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
But I was like, wow.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At 12, you understood
what you were looking at?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I knew
it was not normal.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched enough TV
to know that, what was that?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize the
significance of that moment.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But as the months
and years rolled by--

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and it was always
seared in my head

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:90%
because I never told anyone.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I was from a neighborhood you're
not going to talk about UFOs,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.735 align:middle line:90%
so that's not happening.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
evolve for you then at 12?

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Did you keep going with it, or
did you stop for a few years?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, it stayed
my secret, you know?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the
neighborhood that I grew up in,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
you could have been
the neighborhood bully.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to say,
well, I saw a UFO last night.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Your street credit is gone.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:90%
So it stayed there.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But then "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Then you have "ET phone home."

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of that just
brought it in that,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.115 align:middle line:90%
yeah, where did ET come from?

00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People got
interested in this.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I would always
read the magazines

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
when I'd go to the
store, UFO magazines that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:90%
were out at that time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have a
collection of them now.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I would read those
stories, comic books that

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:90%
had the UFO stories in them.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But over time I began
to say, wait a minute.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.885 align:middle line:90%
This is probably a real deal.

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Now how did you migrate to
MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
MUFON, I was watching

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
"Hangar 1," which was one
of their feature things.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I used to always see the
MUFON things on the shirt.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I was like, that's cool.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
There's somebody out there
that investigates UFOs.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Now this was besides
"Coast to Coast"

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and listen to Art Bell
and all of that stuff,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
but there's actual
people doing this.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And so at this time
I was on Facebook

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
or something, social media.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
tracking things

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
because I went to their site,
and I became a member before I

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
became a UFO investigator,
because you can

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%
get a membership to the site.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anybody could?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.332 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
anybody could, so you

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
can access some of the data.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always
a fan, so I always

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:90%
contributed to their cause.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But then there was still
this thing in my home

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
where I really just didn't
talk about it enough.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
But MUFON became an outlet.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden,
I said, you know what?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to become
an investigator.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what was it like,
investigating UFOs and talking

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:90%
to witnesses?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think
for me, again, I always

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:90%
knew that they were real to me.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
No doubts?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Never had doubts?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.605 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, I
haven't had doubts, no.

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
has changed now.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But for me to
start investigating

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
what some of the witnesses--
and the challenges

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
really understand

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the witness themselves,
because before you

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
can go any further
than that, you

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
have to ask those
hard questions,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of humorous to me.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But you know, hey, were you
drinking that night, you know?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And the witnesses tell
you, I had a little bit.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Now most people could
stop right there--

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And walk away.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But I say, what is a
little bit to you versus what

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I think is a little bit?

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't drink at all.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And you find out
maybe it was a keg.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to think, oh, well,
I normally drink three kegs.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to then
trust the witnesses

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
all across the board.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.752 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it
starts, and that's

00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:35.543 align:middle line:84%
what I like the most
with MUFON because you

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:90%
meet some great people.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:90%
There is some great witnesses.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.215 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
that really, really

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.873 align:middle line:84%
have some good
background that you will

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%
believe what they're saying.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
get the witnesses?

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.157 align:middle line:90%
Does MUFON dig them up for you?

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No-- yeah.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:90%
MUFON has a CMS system.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, everything
goes through the hierarchy

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
through our state
director to the person

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:90%
who handles us regionally.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Cases have been assigned to us
at that point, at that level.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And once they're
assigned to us, we

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
have a few days to go into
there, depending on the code,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to contact the
witnesses themselves.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, open up
the case and then make contact.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it based on region?

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So these people you interview
are in the Dallas area?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They'll be more
in the Texas South area.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.015 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So yes, it's all based
upon region because now I think

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:24.815 align:middle line:90%
they may--

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and I may just be saying this.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.602 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're now are going

00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to change some of the
parameters because now we can do

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stuff more virtually.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:90%
But back then--

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
do Zoom calls.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You can do Zoom
because now they bridge it out,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
because if you're going to
go out to the witnesses.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But since COVID had happened,
that all just shut down.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you
come back with a report?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to
finalize some report

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:90%
on the person you interviewed?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
In the CMS, we'll go
through a Form 30,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be
the finalization of us

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:90%
doing our report.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.178 align:middle line:84%
Now the witness don't see
this, but it is examined.

00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you file it.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, when we
file it our state directors

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else
has access to it.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And if there is
any discrepancies,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
they will reach out, or if
we need any more assistance

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
because there are times
that there are things

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that I probably see that
I really don't know what

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at, but there
are more experienced people

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%
that do.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So I will reach out and
then they can assist us.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, we seal it off,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:90%
close their case out.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Then at that point,
it's archived.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
recommendations or your reports

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.892 align:middle line:84%
generally are favorable
to the witness or not?

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, it depends
on the investigator.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:90%
For me, I think you just--

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:90%
I just state the facts.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.223 align:middle line:90%
And you try not to--

00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be too opinionated?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, because
at this point that's--

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm a
believer and you

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
tend to want-- every time a case
is assigned, you want to know,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.607 align:middle line:90%
this is the one.

00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want it to be real.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.965 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You want
it to be real.

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:56.382 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
to-- like I say,

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
once you talk to
the witness and you

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
hear their side
of the story, you

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
go through the protocols
of information,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.182 align:middle line:90%
then you write the report.

00:08:04.182 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to
do a lot of other stuff.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
to check metadata

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.862 align:middle line:90%
on the pictures or the videos.

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going to check the weather
report, because oftentimes

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.528 align:middle line:90%
a witness said, oh, I saw it.

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a clear day.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And you check the weather.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:90%
It was cloudy.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:84%
How could you seen
something up there?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is
not a conversation

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.620 align:middle line:90%
we have with the witness.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.225 align:middle line:84%
They have no clue
that we are being

00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that objective because
all we are doing

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
is just gathering
information from them.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you have, of
course, your own program

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You've developed the podcast
that we've talked about.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.119 align:middle line:84%
So you have evolved into your
own podcast, your own YouTube

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:90%
channel.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
basically again, you

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
want to get your message
out to the world,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
especially being in
my community knowing

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that it's interpreted a little
different or taboo almost.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.685 align:middle line:84%
So when I initially
started my podcast--

00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and the question for
me was curiosity,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
because I go back to the basics,
George, when it comes down.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a high-level
conversation

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to all of this.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm finding
that there's still

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
millions and millions of
people who still have that one

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.207 align:middle line:84%
question, and that
is, are UFOs real,

00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%
or are we alone in the universe?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we alone?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
I began to start

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
looking at all of the
secrets that we've heard.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wait a minute.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, it's also
inspired by the movie

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
"Men in Black" when
Will Smith sat down

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
with Tommy Lee in that
scene when he says,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
why the big secret?

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And Tommy Lee, you
know, K, said, you know,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
well, he says people
can handle it.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what Will Smith said.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But Tommy Lee says, no,
a person can handle it.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
People are dumb, crazy,
and they're out of control.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point
it gave me some context

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to think, why is
it a big secret?

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about Roswell or
any of these, and I'm thinking,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, now over the years of
the past 50 or 60 years,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:90%
we hear what they found.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a crash or the
possible alien bodies.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:90%
But what's the real secret?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, what
would it really be?

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Such as, what if the
extraterrestrials told

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
us something about free energy?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Wouldn't that
be the big secret, right?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly, because
they don't want that.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.848 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They don't
want that out there.

00:10:22.848 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So instead of us focusing on the
narratives that is leaked out

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
or we think we've
found something great,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
it's the strategy behind this.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
getting curious.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Think why is what
I tell my audience.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that begins
the possibilities

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
of the curiosity questions.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And once we start
that, oh my god.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we get into a
whole nother level.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roderick, the amazing
documentary film producer

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs, James Fox, was
on "Beyond Belief--"

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and talked about
how he got into this field.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
How'd you get involved in
this true obsession with UFOs?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES FOX: I really
wanted to know the truth.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:10%
When a good friend of mine
started talking about Roswell--

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:10%
this was in the
very early '90s--

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:10%
I honestly felt that
he had lost his mind.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:10%
But he's a really good friend.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And then I was working
doing video production

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:10%
in San Francisco.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I was doing PSAs, Public
Service Announcements.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the guys that I
really respected on the job

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:90%
site was like, oh, yeah.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Roswell really did
actually happen,

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.398 align:middle line:84%
and he confirmed a
bunch of stuff for me.

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hmm.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
into it, and here I

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
am all these years later, still
wanting to get to the truth.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm getting
closer to the truth,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is more
elusive than I expected.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like one step
forward, two steps back?

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: One step
forward, 10 steps back.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That much?

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, yeah.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frustrating.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.137 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, it is and it isn't.

00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really feel like
I'm getting closer to knowing

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:90%
what the government knows.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
government knows the real,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and they have for quite
some time, as early back

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:90%
as the situation in '48.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
But I'm beginning to believe--

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and some people are
going to hate me

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
for saying this-- that it's
more a question of what

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
the government doesn't know
as opposed to what they know

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:90%
is the reasons for secrecy.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't let the cat
out of the bag and not have--

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
it's going to open up a
floodgate of inquiries.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine
admitting that they're real

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and then not having
all the answers?

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we don't really--

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Not being able
to back it up or tell us

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:10%
if it's dangerous or not?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Are they taking us?

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they eating us?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what?

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I think people would panic.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you questioned
the nondisclosure

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
from government, why
they don't tell us?

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I mean,
saying what James has said.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, like I
was just alluding to,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
we never saw a UFO
stop for gas, right?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they're
using something different.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And just as his question
is to go deeper.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So with the
government disclosure,

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, it's
all a narrative.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It is their way of
letting this thing--

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and like you said, they may not
know everything, and maybe not.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:90%
But who's to--

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I know what they're
not telling us,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's everything
that they know, right?

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the disclosure
side of the government,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:90%
we probably will never know.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
times have changed, though.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go back
to the '40s and '50s,

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.490 align:middle line:90%
there was a different network.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Now you have children of
those people are now senators.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in
another 10 or 15 years,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we'll probably
have a whole change

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of government in
some of the powers

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:90%
to get the questions answered.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
talk to witnesses,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
what seems to be the most
predominant answer that they

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
give you about these
UFOs that they see?

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think
when I really dig into it,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
George, we spent a lot of time
focusing as investigators,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:90%
researchers on the UFOs itself.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
evolving for me is

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to start trusting the witness
because now you're getting down

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to what they say or their
stories, their emotion,

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
really verify all of it.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.013 align:middle line:84%
But that's where I
get into where I now

00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
have to know what
they're really looking

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%
for is someone to believe them.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
be one of the greatest

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
stories from a witness
you've ever heard?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think from the
greatest stories would be that

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I ever heard--

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
now, with that being via MUFON,
which, outside of MUFON is I

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
will say one of the
greatest stories

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
was a hybrid story
of a person saying

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
how they have had
hybrid children

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and how they have been
on a spacecraft, and just

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the deepness of that, and really
how they really was giving me

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:90%
a descriptive of their story.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe them?

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I had to, because--

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and here's where I go with this,
and this is a powerful thing.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's no more of believing
the story itself.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I have to believe you
believe, and that's

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
what gives me the power to
come with you on your journey.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you
look for that on them?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, you have to.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their
actions, their eyes?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Their eyes, the way
they tell the story, the way--

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that
they put behind it,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people are not
understanding the mental health

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
in this thing, and some
people carry a heavy burden

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
when it comes down
to this phenomenon.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you can see it and
feel it and come through it,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to believe what
they're saying to go with them.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you told me,
Roderick, behind that

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.482 align:middle line:84%
dumpster there's a leprechaun,
and I can't see it.

00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't even see the rainbow.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:90%
But I do want the gold.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
I have to believe George.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.765 align:middle line:84%
And if George is
emotional enough,

00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
then I must say,
George, you know what?

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe you believe that
there's something behind that.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And for that, I'm going to
go with you on this journey.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the ETs are doing?

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:90%
What's their goal here?

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: [LAUGHS] I think--

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:90%
we hear so many stories, OK?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
We hear the ancient civilization
stories back into now.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I think now the ETs, if
they had an agenda by now,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.432 align:middle line:90%
they are now displaying--

00:16:18.432 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
two sides of this coin

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
where they're malevolent
or benevolent.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I tend to lean
with the process of insurance.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I just want us to be safe
if something was to come up.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So the agenda of
them I don't think

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
has been known because that's
where the why the big secret

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.992 align:middle line:84%
But if we start
looking at the facts,

00:16:39.992 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
though, from cattle
mutilations to abductees

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
to all of these things
that's happening,

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:90%
somebody is studying us.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And for why we don't know, but
I'd rather be prepared for it.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This agenda would
not be that bad, though,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
or they would have done
something to us by now,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:90%
don't you think?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I don't
know about that.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I question that.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And I have an example for that.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We all have alarm
systems in our homes, OK?

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
We turn them on at night for
security for us and our family.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.658 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But if there
was something or someone

00:17:11.658 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
or something standing
across the street,

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
and every time you armed
that alarm it raised its hand

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and it disarmed your alarm,
it's going to really take you

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.641 align:middle line:90%
into a frenzy.

00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it hadn't
broken into the house.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't done anything.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It just kept letting you know--

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yet.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't
allow me to sleep

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
at night to say just
because they haven't done

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
anything doesn't mean
the possibility--

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
but when they do display the
power through their technology,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
through all of the things that
they do that we can't keep up

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
with, our military saying
how much of the air threat

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:84%
it is, that let us know
there is something out there,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility's there,
and we should act accordingly.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get your
opinion on Chase Kloetzke,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
a MUFON member
who was on my show

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and talked about what she
thought was the agenda.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>CHASE KLOETZKE: There's
information on all sides,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:10%
and we have to weigh everybody.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
If they're a credible
witness and they're

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
coming to you with they're
all good or they're all bad,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and this is reproductive and
they're stealing our babies

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and creating hybrids, I think
it's premature to jump in a box

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:90%
too quickly.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it all
together, what again,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't it be a bunch
of different agendas?

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I kind of look at
it as if say you

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered intelligent
life on another planet.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And we come back,
and who would want

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to be on that spaceship for
the next time we go out?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Who would want to be with us?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Virologists, biologists,
sociologists, scientists,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All kinds of people.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.528 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them
with their own agenda,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
which is the most important--

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To them.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
In the study of
this new species we

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
found, much like we do
in the jungles today

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:90%
when we find a new bug.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if
there just happens

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to be that same
scenario that if they're

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
an advanced culture that has
all this intelligent technology,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
there would be many
agendas and many reasons

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
to come at us the way they do.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
However, there's no
evidence one way or another,

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
so we're still working.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
she's spot on, Rod?

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I
think she's spot on.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And even myself just
finished a documentary,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was the military
encounters and stories

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.253 align:middle line:90%
that had never been told.

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that also posed
a whole different perspective

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
on this because on one hand
you have people that say, OK.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
They come in peace.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:90%
They've not done anything.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
see the coverup

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of some of the
military encounters

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and you think about that--

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have the most feared
military in the world, right?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.095 align:middle line:84%
We have some
advanced technology.

00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:00.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:00.928 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But when you have some
of these pilots such as what

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
you saw in the TikTok videos
and how they was excited,

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
but then you hear the truth
that they were not excited,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:84%
they were scared or they had a
lot of feared sentiment, that

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
lets you know that there's
another side of this

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:90%
that we need to be looking at.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so as she's saying,
it's a lot of pieces,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and they all need
to come together.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
Congress is really trying to do

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.888 align:middle line:84%
is get all of these agencies
to begin to report together.

00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
separate right now.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a hodgepodge.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, because
if you think about it,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
you get a case that
something comes out

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of the water in California.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We've got-- the Coast
Guard may report it.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Then once it goes up a little
higher, the Navy is involved.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, it done hit the sky,
but it zoomed in seconds

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
over to another
part of the country.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force is involved.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe it landed
and abducted somebody.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the army.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But all this is one encounter,
but we have all these agencies,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
got different reports,
and they're not

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
communicating because
they're keeping it

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
all in their own
compartmentalized way.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We need all of them to work
as one, share the technology,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
share the information, and then
hopefully we get some things

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to the public, and it's just
not so much our government

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
working in separate capacities.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
get reports, they

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.585 align:middle line:84%
come from people of
all walks of life.

00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
remember back when

00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I was 11 years old the
Barney and Betty Hill

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
case where we had an
African American married

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to a Caucasian woman, which
was a no-no in those days.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
That's how ridiculous
society was in those days.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was a huge story, and
it got pretty good coverage.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
"Look" magazine
had a spread on it.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
John Fuller wrote a story
called "The Interrupted

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Journey" about them.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a big story.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting African
Americans and others

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to come forward with
these kinds of stories,

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:90%
or are they holding back?

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I think they're there.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
holding back side of it

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
would be a little bit yes.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
societal for this.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Even then as you alluded back
to when the Betty and Barney

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.165 align:middle line:90%
Hill story--

00:22:23.165 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
at a time that there

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of
segregation and things.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
even back then

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
if an African American
person at that time frame

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.100 align:middle line:84%
would have seen a
UFO, he's not going

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to walk into the
local police station

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
because you had a
lot of issues there.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to go to
some of the organizations

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, by the
way, you're talking to--

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
extraterrestrials

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and I see them.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I was out there
and something abducted me.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:10%
And so you're talking
a don't pass go,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:10%
don't click $200,
straight to jail.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going straight
to jail, you know?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's the ticket.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:90%
So imagine those stories.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But yet I think that we were
on the same military boats,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
the bases, some of
the same stories.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:90%
We were there in presence.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.323 align:middle line:90%
And so there lies--

00:23:16.323 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:90%
there's another thing.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes into some
religious aspects of it

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:90%
as well in our community.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think the Betty
and Barney Hill really

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
was significant in
history because it

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
did have an interracial
couple, which

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.188 align:middle line:84%
definitely the extraterrestrials
didn't mind, and probably had--

00:23:36.188 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nobody
should have mind.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else
should have mind.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:90%
their story was authentic.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.393 align:middle line:84%
I think that it did open
the gap in the stories up.

00:23:47.393 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to
understand too, George.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Probably it was the best of
the best available at the time.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a great story.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And so why wouldn't
somebody run with it?

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We might have this African
American segment in it,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:90%
but wait a minute.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a great couple.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Both of them was
bona fide people.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, let's look at
this from a witness standpoint.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And to back up what you
said, when I was 21 years old

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a radio reporter
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr. Benjamin
Simon, their psychiatrist

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:90%
who was in Boston.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Picked up the phone.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:90%
He answered.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Simon, I'm interested
in this UFO case.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed
with these stories.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, can I interview you?

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, sure.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I wish I still had
the tapes with me.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Wow.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
said specifically--

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, you
archive yourself.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
We can just get the questions.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are Barney
and Betty Hill--

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
did they lie to you about
this incredible experience?

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they got abducted.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But they believe they did, and
they didn't lie about it to me.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.093 align:middle line:90%
And that was the great story.

00:24:56.093 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that's the
point, and that's how

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I approach my witnesses today.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
out all of the noise

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and begin to look at the
individual themselves.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do
that, you can then

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
begin to listen to their story
objectively and then maybe put

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
some emotion to it
from their perspective

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and come up with some
suggestion that, you know what?

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
This might have
happened to these people

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:90%
because look at this.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Look how it has disturbed them.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
you're just going to make up

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.777 align:middle line:84%
and wake up in the
morning saying,

00:25:30.777 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
not only were we an
interracial couple,

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but let's bring something
else into the mix.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we were abducted
and studied.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, and
with that intelligence--

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and I think Barney had a
high IQ and she worked with--

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So that don't tell
you to go make some stuff up.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, now you're

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
either going to be
ridiculed for years or--

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But then today, let's
take this in today,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I think there's vindication
with all this happening now.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
We can now go back and say,
oh, that raised the probability

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.872 align:middle line:90%
to 99.9%.

00:26:04.872 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I told you so.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I told you so, yes.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
brought up religion.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:10%
And religion and your
work in the ET field

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:10%
had an effect on you personally.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Helped cause a divorce.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I think even
though I will say our issues

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:90%
had issues--

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:90%
but let's add that to the issue.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This pushed it over--

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It pushed it because
I was now going toward the fact

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to make
a career out of this,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
have a conversation.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.015 align:middle line:84%
So you think about all the
people I've interviewed.

00:26:36.015 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're told their spouses
their most intimate secrets,

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
where the codes are, everything
except for an extraterrestrial

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So I take my wife who
was a little younger,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
about 15 years younger, and
her religious background

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
was pretty intact
in Christianity.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:90%
And here I am saying, OK, look.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
ufology and become--

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Full time.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Full time.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Full time.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And she
already thought

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:90%
this was a cuckoo idea, OK?

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was to a point I
had three stepchildren, sons

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in the house, and I
used to stay up at night

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.603 align:middle line:84%
and try to watch the
"Ancient Aliens" because I

00:27:14.603 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure I don't
watch this during the day.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And the channel was turned
off of it when she awakens.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Just didn't know.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And the boys were
not subject to that,

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:90%
although they had interests too.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand as I do
now from a cultural lens what

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
was happening, and that's
really how everything

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
is based on our experiences.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So she grew up where the story
of Jesus Christ, in which I

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:90%
was raised Christian as well.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
You didn't deny that.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, I
didn't deny that.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:90%
But the stories of it.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.437 align:middle line:84%
And for her, it's just, I don't
want you watching that stuff.

00:27:50.437 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear
about this stuff.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So imagine being in a
relationship and some

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of your most enthusiastic
things that you want to talk

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to your partner
about you cannot.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you find refuge
in finding organizations

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:90%
like MUFON.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what drove me
to MUFON, looking for--

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you drifted
apart, didn't you?

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.785 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: We drifted apart.

00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And I remember distinctively
one of the days

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that I had set forward-- it was
like three weeks in advance,

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I'm going
to my first MUFON meeting.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meet some
people to talk about UFOs.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.395 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you, I was like--

00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, I gave
her the whole plan.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were a kid in
a candy store, weren't you?

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:84%
The two weeks notice,
the one-week notice,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the seven-day notice down to
the three days to the, baby,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow I'm going.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And just so happens we
was down to one car.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never
forget this moment.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.567 align:middle line:84%
It was on a Sunday, and she
went to church with her sister--

00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the car.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In the car, the only
car that we had at the time.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.915 align:middle line:84%
And I knew she was
going to-- she normally

00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:90%
would get back around noon.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to be a little
late, but you're talking late

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to a meeting that I just--

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.205 align:middle line:90%
that was enough for me.

00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I just needed to get there.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
to get there.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And so here she is.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
The phone rings.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing something in
the background, some clinking.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:90%
They was out to eat.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was just floored.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, where are you?

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm out to such and such.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.270 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to deal with this.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
have Uber in those days.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.023 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, they didn't.

00:29:25.023 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they did, but I just
wasn't really-- it wasn't--

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm married.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:90%
This is my wife.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:90%
This is our car.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't need Uber.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I just need-- bring the car
home like we talked about.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her, why?

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And she says, because I
don't want you fooling around

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:90%
with that stuff and all of that.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I was so
depleted at the moment.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And I just said to myself, OK.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And here's what was
about to happen.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I sat back and I said, you've
got to be the good husband.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:84%
This is mentally
affecting your wife.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And so give it up.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Take the high road.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Give up this pursuit because
this is in the house.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so unfortunately, we
separated a few months later

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
because like I said, we already
had some issues, but this--

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:90%
this was--

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Icing on the cake.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That was it.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It was that.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.883 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately,
I was separated.

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you separate,
you're liberated.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I'm going
to do all the things

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to do because
you're thinking

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
your relationship's not
going to come back anyway.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I took the
exam for MUFON,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
passed it, and then
later on went on

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.723 align:middle line:84%
and started one of
the largest UFO clubs.

00:30:34.723 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Now do a weekly show.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I've got a podcast
that's in 59 countries.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're happy.

00:30:40.293 --> 00:30:41.415 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And I'm happy.

00:30:41.415 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, TV show.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also giving back
to the community of this.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.835 align:middle line:90%
And imagine had I not done that.

00:30:50.835 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You never would
have been satisfied.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.168 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Never-- it would have
been the most thing in life

00:30:55.168 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that you would ever have
is look back on regret.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bible
definitely shows some type

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
presence, whether it's

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:90%
fallen angels, Ezekiel's wheel.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:10%
On Gaia's "Deep
Space" program they

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.383 align:middle line:10%
talked about the Bible and ETs.

00:31:16.383 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: When
we're reading the Bible,

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:10%
we always have to
look to the first page

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:10%
to see, which version of
the Bible are you reading?

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:10%
The New International version?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
The new New
International version?

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.710 align:middle line:90%
The King James version?

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:90%
The Saint Jerome version?

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Which version are you reading?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the language is
going to be different.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
If we were to write, for
example, the ET version

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, we'd go back
to every story where it says,

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and the heavens opened,
and realize they're

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.895 align:middle line:90%
talking about a stargate.

00:31:44.895 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:84%
What else could be the
heavens opening but a rip

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space time?

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
way we can start

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to connect with what the
ancients were actually

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.860 align:middle line:90%
seeing or experiencing.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.743 align:middle line:84%
Their language was
different from ours.

00:31:57.743 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They would say the
heavens opened.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We would say, oh,
a stargate opened.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's as much a
function of language

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that separates us from
true understanding

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.707 align:middle line:90%
is it is anything else.

00:32:07.707 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON: There
are so many references

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact in the Bible.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
There are 70 verses
describing clouds

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
as vehicles, 15 verses
describing pillars,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:84%
10 verses describing
dwellings as vehicles,

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:84%
160 verses describing
lights and fire as vehicles.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:84%
There's 17 verses
describing spinning wheels

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and also 22 verses
describing dark

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and shining objects as vehicles.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:84%
There's also 37 verses of
various objects in the Bible

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that describe UFOs as flying
furnaces and burning bushes.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:10%
So as you can see, based
off of the vocabulary

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:10%
of the people of
those times, they

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:10%
can only use words that
would help them describe what

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:10%
we would call nowadays UFOs.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The Bible
begins with the Book of Genesis

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and it ends with the
Book of Revelations.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:10%
In between are dozens of
stories that reference

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:10%
what many scholars suggest may
be extraterrestrial phenomena.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.788 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's very exciting.

00:33:07.788 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think for me
in the Bible that

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:16.890 align:middle line:84%
started my journey was the Book
of Genesis Chapter 1 Verse 26.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And it read, let's
make men in our image.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Our image.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In the
likeness of ourselves.

00:33:21.935 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I went to school,
so at some point

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.015 align:middle line:90%
I was told that our was plural.

00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And so I was
like, what is this?

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's not talking about
a singular god here.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a possibility of gods.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's also one
of the questions

00:33:37.305 --> 00:33:38.430 align:middle line:90%
I get all the time, George.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
People are like, what
do the aliens look like?

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.243 align:middle line:84%
What are they-- and I say,
well, what if we look like them.

00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: [LAUGHS] You know.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's the question.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think even
further now I like

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
to tend to go one
more step, George.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is when people say,
are we alone in the universe,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and I say now the question
you should be asking,

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
are we alone here on Earth,
let's bring it down now,

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have to go
out there to look for them.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.438 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they've been here.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They've been here,
our waters, all of those things.

00:34:11.378 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
the theory of the late Zecharia

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin that the
Anunnaki came down here,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:84%
seeded whatever creatures
might have been on the planet

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
at that time, and here we are.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's possible
because in his books

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.619 align:middle line:84%
he talks about how
they created us.

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was saying one
of the gods at that time said,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.260 align:middle line:90%
well, hey.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's create this
slave race or whatever.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, what
you seek is already here.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go--
and at that time

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.360 align:middle line:84%
we weren't able to
procreate was what

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:90%
he was saying in the story.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And so now you look
at the fact that--

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:84%
you look at that
Anunnaki stories.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
You look at all of those, the
Noah, the Ark, and the stories.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
you coordinate

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:90%
that with what the Bible says.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you find
some truth in this,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and then you find some
truth in those stories,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.568 align:middle line:90%
and you begin to--

00:35:08.568 --> 00:35:10.860 align:middle line:84%
let's bring this together
because the possibilities are

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:84%
high that there was
some ancient gods.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.910 align:middle line:84%
There were ancient
civilizations.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.118 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's very exciting.

00:35:17.118 --> 00:35:20.256 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can understand
why you're so into this.

00:35:20.256 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It gets in your
blood, doesn't it?

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's a
rabbit hole that we

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.600 align:middle line:90%
can't get to the bottom.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so much life has so
much ceilings, right?

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
we have no ceilings.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- it's
like, what are we

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:84%
going to know tomorrow is
what really drives you,

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:84%
because what we know today
we just learned yesterday.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was exciting
enough, but what

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:90%
are we going to know tomorrow?

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Congress asked you
to come testify, would you go?

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: In a heartbeat.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I'll sleep there.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll do that Apple
thing and put a tent

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and be out in front
and everything.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is
Robert Jones' friend?

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Robert Jones' friend
I think is a phenomenal story.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
original Tuskegee airmen.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Not the experiment,
but one of the pilots.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
He was in that group
with Tuskegee--

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heroes.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:13.560 align:middle line:90%
War heroes.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: War heroes.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And now of course,
he was at a time

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that African American
pilots was not seen to be--

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or accepted.

00:36:22.565 --> 00:36:25.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --or accepted in the
status quo of the Air Force,

00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:26.231 align:middle line:90%
or what became the Air Force.

00:36:26.231 --> 00:36:27.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What times
that we have, huh?

00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And-- but yet one of the highly
respected fighter groups, OK?

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But then you're still
talking about what

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.280 align:middle line:84%
they went through as the
segregation side of life, OK?

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But then over the years I
started making some more

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:90%
discovery as I read his story.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even UFO-related
until I got to a point

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
where he was over
Project Blue Book.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
are you kidding me?

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, from 1958 to 1963.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.495 align:middle line:84%
But I still thought
about this, George.

00:37:00.495 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I kept thinking, hmm.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about a
time that this phenomenon

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.395 align:middle line:90%
was still known--

00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
what Stan Friedman said.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
This is where
ufology comes from.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So the military would
say, hey, that person's

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:84%
a ufologist, meaning that's
their code word for the joke,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.495 align:middle line:84%
So let's think
about this person.

00:37:20.495 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about
the phenomenon.

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going out
on a limb here, OK?

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And why would they do this?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time you're
talking UFOs were a joke.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to hang
their career upon it.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But they needed to really
have a deeper dive.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And they already had
Blue Book, you know?

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But then if we're going
to ruin somebody's career,

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:90%
let's pick him, you know?

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Why not?

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And so he's African American.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you go through
the stories of history,

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:90%
we don't hear that.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
drove me into this idea.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I even took the time
and pitched an idea

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to one of the
producing companies,

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and so a network is
going to pick it up.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do something
called a minority report,

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be me
going all over-- back

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
over to Zimbabwe,
different places.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Some celebrities,
different people

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.800 align:middle line:84%
in the African
American community

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:84%
getting that perspective
based on religion,

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
and how we perceive it.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But also dig up some
history of stories

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that have never been
told but was right there

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.500 align:middle line:90%
in the timeline.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But because of what was
happening in history,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
they were never
going to be told.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
great investigator.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.635 align:middle line:90%
I can tell already.

00:38:34.635 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm just--
I'm an enthusiast.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm just--

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.668 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love this.

00:38:37.668 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I mean,
investigation is just

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:84%
the title, but it's
the blood-- it's the--

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.090 align:middle line:90%
we just want the answers.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I call them the
big secret keepers.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I just want them to
tell us the truth,

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:90%
like he said in the clip.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get curious.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's curiosity.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think we're
getting close to disclosure.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.608 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
think I ever would

00:38:57.608 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
have said that 10 years ago,
but I think we're getting close.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree?

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I think-- no.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree that we're
going to get to the answers.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we're getting closer
to a new narrative, George,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's disguised
under disclosure.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Our military don't do
nothing without a plan.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.883 align:middle line:90%
We cannot believe--

00:39:22.883 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not stupid.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They're not stupid.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not just-- loose
lips sink ships, right?

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not letting some of
this stuff out unintentionally.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Something is happening.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've
got to get curious.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And don't take the narrative of
disclosure that we're getting

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and still get
curious and ask why,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:90%
because there's always a plan.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't do anything.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.657 align:middle line:90%
We have to know that.

00:39:47.657 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't do anything
without a plan.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know Richard
Dolan, great UFO--

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh my god, yeah.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on the
Gaia's "Open Minds" show

00:39:53.928 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
with Regina Meredith
talking about his thoughts

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:90%
about disclosure.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: How many
cases have to come out?

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:90%
It's been 50 years.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go back as
far as Roswell, 60 years,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:84%
but more that these
cases have been coming.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:84%
At what point does the
government, the military,

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:84%
some official agencies
say, OK, right.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.483 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
becoming absurd now.

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
I agree with you.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: A couple thousand
people in the desert,

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.030 align:middle line:90%
they all know it.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: We're at a point
where the emperor is wearing

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.690 align:middle line:84%
no clothes and someone's
going to make the point

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, he's not
wearing anything at all.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We're just about
there, it seems to me.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we've
had 20 years of internet

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and really 10 years
of a true internet

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:90%
where we have all of this.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:90%
We have a web.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:90%
We have Gaiam TV.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:90%
We have YouTube.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
We have Skype.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.780 align:middle line:90%
We have all-- Facebook.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.430 align:middle line:84%
All of these ways
that we communicate,

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.290 align:middle line:90%
all in the last decade, really.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's all new.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
can see is that this

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.950 align:middle line:84%
has had a dramatic, profound
effect on our civilization.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
is the old paradigm

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
is hanging on by
their fingernails.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.212 align:middle line:84%
And that old paradigm is one
of denial, of the obvious--

00:41:01.212 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
the truth, but really,

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:84%
denial of the obvious
I think is more apt.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.103 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.103 --> 00:41:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But they're still hanging--
you know the expression.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.480 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing so powerful as
an idea whose time has come.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part of that,

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:84%
which is the second most
powerful thing is an idea that

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.533 align:middle line:90%
refuses to go away.

00:41:20.533 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they're at.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:90%
So they're hanging on.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:27.055 align:middle line:84%
That paradigm is
still there, but I

00:41:27.055 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:84%
think what we're seeing
is a real battle here

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.173 align:middle line:90%
between the old and the new.

00:41:30.173 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: I totally agree.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.007 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that events like this

00:41:33.007 --> 00:41:35.000 align:middle line:84%
are mini UFO congresses
of different kinds

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It seems like events like this
will ultimately themselves

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:90%
disappear.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Once there's disclosure
and it's out there,

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.150 align:middle line:84%
then the gathering will
happen in a different way.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to up the
subject matter to something

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe more to do
with consciousness

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.810 align:middle line:84%
than this event occurred,
this event occurred,

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and this event occurred.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Maybe.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I think-- yes, I think
that'll be part of it.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I suspect there'll be a lot
of political repercussions

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:55.580 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.997 align:middle line:84%
I think there'll be a lot of
energy repercussions of this.

00:41:57.997 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking the world
AD, After Disclosure.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a book on it.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I spent a lot of-- right.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Go for some
of that again for anyone

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:84%
who didn't see our
last interview.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.875 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, a number of
years ago I co-authored a book

00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:84%
with a fellow named Bryce
Zabel, and we called it "AD:

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:90%
After Disclosure."

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's really our attempt
to look into the future

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:90%
as a think tank would.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
In a world in which UFO secrecy
ended, A, how might it end?

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And we try to puzzle that one
through in different ways.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But then really more
significantly, B, what then?

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
What is the world likely to
be like after the disclosure

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:90%
of a UFO ET reality?

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He is so
enthusiastic, Rod.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, man.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the best, and I have
all his books and everything.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you-- he alluded
there is what I was saying.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.108 align:middle line:84%
They know they're losing
the control of this,

00:42:51.108 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to
have to have a plan on,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:84%
how do we stay on top
of this narrative?

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said that
even though they're disclosing

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:84%
information to us, there's some
type of disclosure happening,

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.742 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe there's still a
strategic plan on where they're

00:43:06.742 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:84%
going to take it
to the next level,

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.325 align:middle line:84%
because you're talking
about the new space economy.

00:43:10.325 --> 00:43:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about if
there is a space economy

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and we are as a civilization
moving to space to work daily,

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
what's the possibility
of you looking out

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:84%
the window on your way
to work and you see

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.710 align:middle line:90%
some type of extraterrestrial?

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:90%
So the plan is there.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I think that disclosure is--

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
we just had a new
pair-- that's what

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier where you've got
younger people who were kids

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.520 align:middle line:84%
then now are going
to be in Congress

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:90%
with a whole new attitude.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
where the conflict.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.390 align:middle line:10%
But then the military still
thinks they run the show

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:46.390 align:middle line:10%
and they don't really have
to abide by any rules anyway.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're a
UFO investigator.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:10%
You're a YouTuber.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.710 align:middle line:90%
You've got a podcast going.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you, Rod?

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Dream is to
someday, just one moment,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:10%
get the phone call that
