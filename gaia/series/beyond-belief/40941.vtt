I'm George Noory with our very
special guest, John McAfee,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:32.532 align:middle line:84%
of course, the developer of
the McAfee antivirus software,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:36.803 align:middle line:84%
who's branched out into a
number of different areas.

leave the companies

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.096 align:middle line:90%
to more capable folks, so.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: John, in our previous
show, we talked about your life.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.635 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
technology and where we are.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.838 align:middle line:84%
But you're a pretty
intuitive guy at the same time

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.908 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're
pretty methodical,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.378 align:middle line:84%
and you've been looking at
where we are as a planet

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.014 align:middle line:90%
and where we are as people.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.584 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect you still see
some deep-rooted issues here.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.986 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Well, I do.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.957 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- I don't know
whether it's a blessing or a

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
curse. One
of the issues and being

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:84%
in the security field is you
have to know human nature.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:37.664 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: If you
don't, you're not going

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.066 align:middle line:84%
to build a good security
product.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you don't know what
motivates thieves or vandals,

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.736 align:middle line:90%
there's a question for you.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:48.075 align:middle line:84%
What motivates them to spend
a lifetime of vandalizing

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:52.579 align:middle line:84%
of artwork or putting
graffiti on subway cars--

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.247 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: What motivates them?

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:54.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or robbing people--

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:55.649 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- or whatever.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.651 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And if you don't know

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:01.521 align:middle line:84%
that human nature is
what causes the holes

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.424 align:middle line:84%
in our security networks
like as I talked earlier

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.295 align:middle line:84%
about curiosity is one of
the ways that hackers get

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.931 align:middle line:90%
into other people's systems.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.232 align:middle line:90%
If you don't know these things,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.801 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what makes
people tick, you better get

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:90%
out of the security business.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.239 align:middle line:84%
So, I've made a lifelong
study of people

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and what motivates them, and
how to predict their behaviors.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.411 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what it's all about.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I have long suspected

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that people are acting
very weird these days,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.519 align:middle line:90%
almost whacked out.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.588 align:middle line:90%
They're unhappy.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
They're rude.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.225 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on, on this planet.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.626 align:middle line:90%
I can't put my finger on it.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.795 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you found
out-- found the answer to that.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, I don't
know if I found the answer.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:84%
I certainly know
one of the factors.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the factors is technology
has isolated all of us.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.674 align:middle line:84%
We spoke briefly about how
people are more interested

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.676 align:middle line:84%
in their smartphones and in
texting than who's sitting

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.079 align:middle line:90%
across them from the table.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.383 align:middle line:84%
And so this exacerbates the
fundamental problem with people

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:08.221 align:middle line:84%
to begin with which is
communicating and relationship.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.391 align:middle line:84%
We have wars because we do
not understand our enemies.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.694 align:middle line:84%
We don't take the time to try to
see the world from their side.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.164 align:middle line:84%
We want them to see the
world from our side.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.499 align:middle line:84%
That's not relationship,
not at all.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.368 align:middle line:90%
That is self-centeredness.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.804 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a problem
since the beginning of time.

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:27.941 align:middle line:84%
If you add to that an
isolation from humanity

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
through our technology, kids

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.446 align:middle line:84%
who spend all day long
doing video games, you know,

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:37.417 align:middle line:84%
working with the images
of cartoon characters

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.352 align:middle line:84%
which are getting more and
more real-looking by the way,

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:84%
rather than going out
and playing football

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.958 align:middle line:84%
with the neighborhood, then
the problem has exacerbated.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.796 align:middle line:84%
Human relationship is the
fundamental problem here.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.098 align:middle line:84%
And life really is
nothing but relationship.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.902 align:middle line:84%
It's how we relate to people and
to things, our houses, and cars,

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:00.841 align:middle line:84%
and our technology and ideas
that makes us who we are.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.609 align:middle line:84%
The idea of violence
for something.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.077 align:middle line:84%
What is our relationship
to that?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.681 align:middle line:84%
If you're the average person
like you and I, it's abhorrent

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.783 align:middle line:84%
and we want to remove
it from the world.

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.619 align:middle line:84%
If you're a gang leader in
LA, violence is a good thing

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.521 align:middle line:84%
because you get your
street cred--

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- from
being violent.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.892 align:middle line:84%
So, that's one example
of how the relationship

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:21.962 align:middle line:84%
to an idea creates a
completely different thing.

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:25.832 align:middle line:84%
We are nothing but relationships
to the world, to people,

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.001 align:middle line:90%
to things and to our ideas.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.104 align:middle line:84%
So, if we don't understand
that and come to terms with it

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.407 align:middle line:84%
as we get increasingly isolated,
the world is going to be

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.709 align:middle line:90%
in a really sad shape.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:39.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is technology
making it better or worse?

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Making
it worse so far.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.515 align:middle line:90%
It could be making it better.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It should be.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.416 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And it should be.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.752 align:middle line:84%
You know, technology
gives us freedom of--

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.654 align:middle line:84%
the freedom of time
which is great.

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.057 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you realize
how hard we had to work

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:55.362 align:middle line:90%
as human entities 500 years ago?

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get weekends off.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.631 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get anytime off.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.266 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You worked
from day to night--

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What--

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:00.834 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- just
to feed yourself.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.035 align:middle line:90%
Now look at it.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.537 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
nothing but leisure time

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.072 align:middle line:90%
which we fill with nonsense.

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.841 align:middle line:90%
So, it's not helping.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:12.546 align:middle line:84%
We could however use technology
to free us to be more human,

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:84%
to have more contact,
to create--

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:19.753 align:middle line:84%
instead of creating video
games, let us create systems

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.254 align:middle line:90%
where we can communicate

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
with people we would not
normally communicate with.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:90%
People will hold opposing ideas.

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:29.062 align:middle line:84%
People who have
opposing religions.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.264 align:middle line:84%
People who look different
and think different

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle line:90%
and dress differently.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.668 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of these people now

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.603 align:middle line:84%
because we do not
communicate with them.

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they don't want
to communicate with each other.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
They run the other way.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.877 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Because we're as
alien to them as they are to us.

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:47.614 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have the technology
with-- you can go onto Google

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.916 align:middle line:90%
and translate an Arab newspaper.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:50.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:51.518 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Do we do that?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.786 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Very seldom?

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.788 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So, we
have the technology

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.624 align:middle line:84%
to make understanding
much easier.

00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:01.061 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we take that
technology and we do fun

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.696 align:middle line:90%
and games with it, rather

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
than solve the fundamental
problems of humanity.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Social
networking, a plus or a minus?

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.605 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, it could
be a tremendous plus.

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:16.343 align:middle line:84%
The minuses that people who
are on systems like Facebook--

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:19.212 align:middle line:84%
good Lord, the amount
of time that they spend.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:19.913 align:middle line:90%
No, seriously.

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:20.847 align:middle line:90%
Hours a day--

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:22.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They do.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- thinking that
they now know someone or they--

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.952 align:middle line:84%
I have 1,100
friends on Facebook.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And it
started with kids

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.221 align:middle line:90%
but adults are doing it now.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.222 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Adults
are doing it now.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:90%
So, that's not a friend.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
You haven't made a friend
because someone clicks a button.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And who cares
that so and so is going

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.364 align:middle line:90%
to this restaurant tonight.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:38.031 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yeah.

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Who cares!

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.267 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Unless
you're going with them.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're buying.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Right, you know,
but no-- nobody cares.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.207 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it seems to be
of utmost importance,

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.509 align:middle line:84%
far more important than
sitting down with your family

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.344 align:middle line:84%
and discussing the
day's activities--

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's true.

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:53.546 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- and what happened
and how are you feeling

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
and do you have problems
at school,

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.717 align:middle line:84%
do you feel lonely,
do you have friends.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't care 'cause
you're on Facebook.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.353 align:middle line:90%
You have plenty of friends.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.788 align:middle line:90%
You have 2,000 friends.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.723 align:middle line:84%
Don't come to me with
friendship problems.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.791 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And John,
they're all doing this.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:08.328 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've got a
19-year old granddaughter.

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:84%
So, I asked her things about
technology so I can be hip,

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:13.533 align:middle line:90%
right, hip grandfather.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.868 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Let's
talk about that.

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: She told me stuff,
she told me about Facebook,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.373 align:middle line:84%
she said, "Papa, MySpace
is no good anymore.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.641 align:middle line:90%
Go to Facebook."

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.277 align:middle line:84%
And then she told
me about Twitter.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.946 align:middle line:84%
Now she's telling
me about Instagram.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.616 align:middle line:84%
This other thing
called Snapchat.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.717 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't end.

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:31.484 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No.

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It doesn't end.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.186 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they're
all using that.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.722 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:42.462 align:middle line:84%
And I fail to see where we
benefit from this vast network

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.265 align:middle line:84%
of friends that we
don't even know

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:48.268 align:middle line:84%
because online you can be
anybody that you choose.

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:49.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:50.303 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It is easy
to be a good person

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.471 align:middle line:90%
or a brilliant person.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A bully, whatever.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Or whatever you want.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.975 align:middle line:84%
But in person, I get to
know you pretty quickly.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Do you do keep
contact with my eyes?

00:07:58.745 --> 00:07:59.779 align:middle line:90%
Do you shift away?

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.816 align:middle line:84%
You know, are you
articulate or not?

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.451 align:middle line:84%
You can't see these
things on Facebook.

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:05.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.354 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So, I'm not
sure it does us any good.

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:09.322 align:middle line:84%
It could be used for tremendous
good.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And I've
got to tell you,

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.892 align:middle line:90%
more fights by text messaging--

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- than
anything I've ever seen.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.996 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yes, and
so-- they're words.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.265 align:middle line:84%
People go, "Oh my God, she
used all capital letters,

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, don't yell at me."

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like "Whoa.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.935 align:middle line:90%
Please."

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do
you mean by LOL?

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's not funny.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.573 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I know.

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I think we
took a wrong turn somewhere.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.811 align:middle line:90%
And I think because we have--

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:36.116 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of the Greek
play that personifies this.

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:38.183 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe it's
stealing fire from the gods.

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:39.853 align:middle line:84%
We weren't ready for
fire when it was stolen--

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.055 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- in
that Greek play.

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.256 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we're ready
for what we have created.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: On the other
hand, instantaneous news.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.093 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I remember--

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.128 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Spectacular.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:48.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- in my
days and your days--

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.529 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- about the same age?

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.965 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Kennedy got killed.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.668 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know about it until
you heard the radio break in.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.569 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or Cronkite got on.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.004 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Now, it's instant.

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:00.106 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.041 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's worldwide.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.409 align:middle line:84%
When Michael Jackson
died, John--

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- everybody
knew about it--

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- instantly.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:06.513 align:middle line:90%
That's got some benefits.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:07.647 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That's
tremendous benefits.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:84%
And the secondary
benefit is you don't have

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.451 align:middle line:90%
to take anybody's word anymore.

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:13.453 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to take Walter
Cronkite's word even though I

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:14.988 align:middle line:90%
did trust Walter Cronkite.

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Uncle Walt,
we all did.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.593 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So, nevertheless, if
Fox News says something, "Well,

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.228 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
the local news station that's

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.497 align:middle line:78%
got the photographs of it and
see what these photos looks
like."

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.966 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: We can check.

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.335 align:middle line:84%
We can find and choose
for ourself what is true.

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.303 align:middle line:90%
That's terrific.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.704 align:middle line:84%
Do we do it as often
as we should?

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:32.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No, we don't.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.374 align:middle line:84%
But we're still relying
on everybody else.

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:35.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Look at what happened

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:38.845 align:middle line:84%
with the Arab Spring a couple
years ago and it's still ongoing

00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:42.482 align:middle line:84%
where social networking
literally can capture the

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.217 align:middle line:90%
attention of your population--

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:44.717 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:45.819 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:46.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- and get
them out in the streets.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.187 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.621 align:middle line:90%
So, it does have this power.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.724 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And if we can--
if we can go down that path

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:54.394 align:middle line:84%
and take the things
that are good, not--

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.763 align:middle line:84%
good not in the way
of entertaining

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.967 align:middle line:84%
because I fear we are
using these powerful tools

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.503 align:middle line:84%
for entertainment
rather than for utility.

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:04.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I think you're right.

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:05.472 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.508 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They have powerful
potential utility but we

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:12.712 align:middle line:84%
as a bored nation or a bored
world prefers to go, "Oh,

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.015 align:middle line:84%
this is Facebook. I know what,
we can make it entertaining."

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.952 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but what
good is that?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I don't know
why but Edward Snowden,

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:25.625 align:middle line:84%
the NSA whistleblower,
somewhat reminds me of you

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.862 align:middle line:84%
because I think that had you
been in that position,

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.297 align:middle line:84%
you probably would have
done the same thing he did.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.866 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I would-- but
I would not have ended

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:90%
up in a Russian airport.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: In fact if I've
gotten as far as Hong Kong

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.972 align:middle line:84%
like he did, I would
go great Hong Kong,

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:42.041 align:middle line:84%
a great colorful city,
a lot to do here.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
An entrepreneur can
get ahead in Hong Kong.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: There's a lot
that I can create here.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.348 align:middle line:90%
I would have stayed there.

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:90%
Grab some cute Chinese girl

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:52.485 align:middle line:84%
and headed into the back alleys,
got myself an apartment

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.287 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and started a new
life.

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:55.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:56.222 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And he
was in Hong Kong.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
his advisers were,

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.226 align:middle line:84%
but I knew the instance he flew
to Russia, he's not leaving.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That was it for him.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.028 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You don't
leave Russia

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.263 align:middle line:90%
if you're someone of interest.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.031 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: So--

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, he's
begging for clemency here.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:07.901 align:middle line:90%
However, I think he's right.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he had an opportunity

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.939 align:middle line:84%
and a reason I think
to go public.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:84%
When he saw government
doing something illegal,

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.512 align:middle line:84%
he had the right
to say something.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.014 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Even just our
government doing something

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.216 align:middle line:84%
legal, keep in mind,
legal when it comes

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:25.418 align:middle line:84%
to the government is
whatever the government--

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It wants to do.

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- chooses
to define, right.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Look at
Belize for example.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.055 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.456 align:middle line:90%
So-- and all governments do

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:33.593 align:middle line:84%
that because they are powerful
entities and powerful entities

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:35.061 align:middle line:90%
to some extent get corrupt.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.163 align:middle line:90%
This is just a fact.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:40.533 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I mean, he
did-- I'm glad he did it.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:44.237 align:middle line:84%
We deserve to know if our
privacy is being violated

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:47.907 align:middle line:84%
by the people that we elect
to create a government.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:51.611 align:middle line:84%
And government as I see
it is not to spy on us

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:54.113 align:middle line:84%
or to tell us what to
do or to keep us safe.

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:57.784 align:middle line:84%
It's to build roads and schools,
and things that we don't have--

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:58.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:11:59.652 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- the
money to do ourselves.

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Protect medicines.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.088 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And do
these sorts of things.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.158 align:middle line:84%
No, it does-- it has less to
do with that than it has to do

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.793 align:middle line:84%
with we're going
to make you safe,

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.294 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make ourselves
safe and we're going

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:09.762 align:middle line:90%
to make our jobs safe.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:11.097 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's
turned into.

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That is so true.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.436 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you think
of big pharma these days?

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:18.705 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, you
were Belize looking

00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:90%
for some alternative things.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.942 align:middle line:84%
So I think you saw a lot
of things that we've talked

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.277 align:middle line:90%
about on a radio show.

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:25.345 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.145 align:middle line:84%
Well, I haven't said
this before, George.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.081 align:middle line:90%
But one of the reasons I had

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:84%
such a large security force
there is that I was approached

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.319 align:middle line:84%
by pharmaceutical
companies as soon

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:36.089 align:middle line:84%
as I created the
website Quorum X

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.291 align:middle line:84%
and explained what
we'd already done.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.194 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, the big
pharmaceutical companies don't

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:43.796 align:middle line:84%
want anybody inventing
something brand new.

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:44.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And natural.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:45.565 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And natural.

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:46.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And natural.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So, I had
representatives from Bayer

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:53.473 align:middle line:84%
and Merck both came and offered
me suitcases full of money

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:90%
to sell the company to them.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they
could shut it down?

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.443 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So they
could shut it down.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.212 align:middle line:84%
No-- but I didn't say, "So
we could shut it down."

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:00.413 align:middle line:90%
So they could continue--

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But we knew what
they were going to do.

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:01.848 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I don't know.

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:03.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:03.983 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Who knows what
they were going to do.

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:05.084 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't
interest me very much.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:09.622 align:middle line:84%
And so then, you know,
I've talked to some people

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.425 align:middle line:84%
in the pharmaceutical business
that were close friends

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.027 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "You
have to be careful.

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:16.496 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're in a
place where, you know,

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:84%
if you don't cooperate,
they can force cooperation."

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:19.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, that's true.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: So, I--

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Who's to say that the
situation in Belize wasn't that?

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.139 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know,
I don't know.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.741 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to cross the
line into theory--

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:29.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Conspiracy.

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- conspiracy
theory in order

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.712 align:middle line:90%
to make a comment on that.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Sometimes
where there's smoke,

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:35.448 align:middle line:90%
there's fire, and you know that.

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:36.849 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I understand that.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.151 align:middle line:84%
But where the fire is and who
started is always the question.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, our
buddy Alex Jones would say.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, John you know
they're after you in--

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.791 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Maybe.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:46.859 align:middle line:84%
I know someone is after
me, that's for sure.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:49.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, you
were trying to find what?

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.964 align:middle line:90%
Some natural--

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.132 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yeah.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:56.102 align:middle line:84%
We discovered scientifically
about 10 years ago

00:13:56.102 --> 00:14:00.773 align:middle line:84%
that bacteria aren't just
simple single-celled organisms

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.408 align:middle line:90%
that are mindless entities.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.043 align:middle line:90%
They actually communicate.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:07.647 align:middle line:84%
They're like ants where
there's a tribe mind.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:08.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They know
what they're doing.

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They know
what they're doing.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.184 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Unlike of a--

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.654 align:middle line:84%
let's say a flesh-eating
staphylococcus infection.

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:16.956 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria doesn't
get onto your skin

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.725 align:middle line:84%
and immediately start
eating you.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.893 align:middle line:84%
If it did, there's only
a few of those cells,

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:84%
your immune system would
wipe it out instantly.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good point.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.697 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: They wait

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.232 align:middle line:84%
until they're a few
trillions of them and a bio--

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Then they attack.

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:29.268 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Then they communicate
and say, "How many are we now?"

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.737 align:middle line:90%
"Well, almost 10 trillion.

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:32.638 align:middle line:84%
In a few minutes, we're
going to turn pathogenic."

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:84%
Then instantly, all trillion
of them start eating your flesh.

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.077 align:middle line:90%
By then, it's too late.

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.912 align:middle line:90%
So, they're smart creatures.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
also a good point.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:41.848 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And so--

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're alive, right?

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.652 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They're alive and
short, so-- I heard this and I

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.856 align:middle line:84%
go, "Whoa, what an incredible
concept."

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:52.325 align:middle line:84%
So then, I discovered
that plants,

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.061 align:middle line:84%
by the way plants have been
in existence for, you know,

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
a billion years
longer than animals.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.766 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
the ability to move

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:02.769 align:middle line:84%
and escape their
diseased comrades.

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:06.939 align:middle line:84%
So they have developed extremely
sophisticated immune reactions.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.941 align:middle line:84%
One of those reactions
especially in the jungle

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:13.045 align:middle line:84%
where there's such a
mass-- a huge biomass--

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- is a thing called
anti-quorum sensing compounds

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.953 align:middle line:84%
that disrupt the ability for
the bacteria to communicate,

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.588 align:middle line:84%
meaning they never
turned photogenic.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's like
a super antibiotic.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.691 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It's like
a super antibiotic.

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:29.762 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing about it is
it has a no systemic issues.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.532 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it merely disrupts--
it makes them all deaf.

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.767 align:middle line:84%
So they think there's never
enough of them around--

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And the bacteria
can't outsmart it, right?

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:37.937 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And they
can't outsmart you.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.174 align:middle line:84%
So then, you're not weakened
by this massive response

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:43.442 align:middle line:84%
to being eaten alive
and the immune

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.144 align:middle line:84%
system over time just
wipes them all out.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, it's
kind of funny, John.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:49.148 align:middle line:84%
Just last week, they came
out with a report that said,

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:54.754 align:middle line:84%
"We think we're at the end of
developing any new antibiotics."

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:55.521 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well,
that's nonsense.

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.156 align:middle line:90%
Prescription wise.

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:57.957 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yeah,
prescription wise.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Prescription wise.

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.159 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That's
utter, utter nonsense.

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:02.862 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, what I
discovered is a number

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:84%
of plants had these
anti-quorum sensing compounds

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:12.038 align:middle line:84%
and we had created about
10,000 doses of a topical,

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:14.207 align:middle line:90%
meaning external, antibiotic

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:16.642 align:middle line:84%
which was magical,
truly magical.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Tried it out?

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: All that-- we
tried it out on local--

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle line:84%
again, it's an external thing so
this-- what can happen to me--

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:23.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.817 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- and it's based on
jungle plants which people eat.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But we had extracted the
anti-quorum sensing compounds

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.355 align:middle line:90%
and it was magical.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And about the time
where we're going to go

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.692 align:middle line:84%
into clinical trials,
the army came in

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:33.793 align:middle line:90%
and destroyed everything.

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Plant is only
available in Belize?

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:36.462 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Only available
in Belize.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:37.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You're kidding?

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.464 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Nope.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No way to get seeds--

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.068 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Only available
on-- along one river.

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:90%
The river that I was on.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And I bet the soil
has a lot to do with it.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:47.106 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: The soil, the
climate, the-- who knows.

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:51.544 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's such a-- the
interrelationship between animal

00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:84%
and plant species and climate
is so complex and subtle that,

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.418 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's very difficult
to point one to thing and say,

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:00.419 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, this is what it is."

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What another
brilliant story.

00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:04.055 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It was a
tragic story, really.

00:17:04.055 --> 00:17:05.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It is tragic.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I had to leave all of
that because they destroyed all

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.062 align:middle line:84%
of my research, they
destroyed my samples.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How much did you
invest in that if I could ask?

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:13.866 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Way too much,
I'm afraid, George.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:17.737 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it amazing that this
planet has the ability

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:22.275 align:middle line:84%
to cure just about every
ailment or disease?

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.976 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Bacterial
not viral but--

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.145 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: -- any bacterial--

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.647 align:middle line:84%
absolutely, whether it's Gram
negative or Gram positive.

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:30.216 align:middle line:84%
The two types of bacteria
wipes them out--

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What does that
tell you about the planet?

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It is alive.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.858 align:middle line:84%
And also it tells me that there
are yet an infinite number

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:41.027 align:middle line:84%
of things for us to
discover about this planet.

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:43.596 align:middle line:84%
This planet is just
as mysterious today

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:46.332 align:middle line:84%
as it was before we
learned to read and write.

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:48.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do the big pharma
companies know the name

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.602 align:middle line:90%
of this plant?

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:50.336 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No, they don't.

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They do not.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.438 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: They wanted the name.

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:57.543 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were-- you
know, they were pretty excited

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:59.946 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility of just
taking the whole company.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:01.681 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they were
going to try and use it.

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.015 align:middle line:90%
But I gave up nothing.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:04.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right, right.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.584 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I gave up nothing.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:09.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The reason you decided
not to sell to them was what?

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:10.389 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Because I was right
in the middle of having--

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.925 align:middle line:84%
I was-- the part that I
enjoy, George, is building.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is building.

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Discovering.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
what you're doing.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.495 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And figuring
out how--

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make a
systemic version,

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.131 align:middle line:90%
a pill that we could pop.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:19.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:20.766 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And--

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Like they've
done with aspirin.

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.601 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Like aspirin.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.602 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was--
that's was my big thing

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.071 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
was working on.

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:27.139 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to about to
sell the big pharmacy when I'm

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.809 align:middle line:84%
about to come out with
something I'm really enjoying.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: There's no
way to duplicate that?

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:33.045 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- come
back in five years

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.514 align:middle line:84%
when we've grown and
I'm bored --

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:36.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.783 align:middle line:84%
And then you're ready
to go again.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yeah, but they
didn't want to any of that.

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:39.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Unbelievable,
and then there's now way

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:40.953 align:middle line:90%
to duplicate this?

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:41.921 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I can't.

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:42.755 align:middle line:84%
I don't have access
to the plants.

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't ever go back to Belize.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What if the
government there changed?

00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:48.928 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: If it
changed, it's possible.

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:49.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It's possible.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.399 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind like
many two-party systems,

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:54.333 align:middle line:90%
either party is--

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're the same.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.068 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They're
the same thing.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're the same.

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.838 align:middle line:84%
Did you leave behind
a home and--

00:18:58.838 --> 00:18:59.672 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Everything I owned.

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- assets like that?

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.142 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I left the
country with a pair of shorts.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:05.978 align:middle line:84%
I borrowed shirts from
friends and shoes and came

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:90%
to America with nothing.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I don't want to get
too personal but bank accounts?

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: All my bank
accounts, my houses--

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They seized all that?

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:12.852 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee:-- everything is gone.

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:14.053 align:middle line:90%
Everything is gone.

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:15.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: My God.

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:18.057 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: We live
to learn, don't we?

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:18.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We do.

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:19.191 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: So--

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We do.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.627 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Here's
what I think, George.

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:25.965 align:middle line:84%
I think that making money is
far easier than people think.

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The reason it is
difficult for some people is

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.869 align:middle line:84%
because they're doing
things they do not love.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:33.072 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love what you're
doing, get out of it.

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Forget about money.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The plant
story fascinates me.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.043 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:38.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I'm sure that
when you moved to Belize,

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:41.647 align:middle line:84%
you didn't just say,
"Oh I know this plant

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.481 align:middle line:90%
will do this."

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:42.982 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No.

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:90%
No idea.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:44.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Somebody had
to tell you something.

00:19:44.884 --> 00:19:45.718 align:middle line:90%
Some native--

00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:46.485 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:47.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- some shaman--

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- something happen.

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:49.922 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.725 align:middle line:84%
'Cause-- this is where
the wealth of information

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:55.194 align:middle line:84%
with medical information
resides in this world,

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:84%
it's not with our
modern day doctors.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:00.966 align:middle line:84%
What we know how to do or
what modern medicine knows how

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to do is break down something
into its constituents.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.238 align:middle line:84%
And say, that this may
work or that may work.

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:10.042 align:middle line:84%
But to divide and cut
something up and think

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:14.246 align:middle line:84%
that you've discovered something
is going the wrong way.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:19.118 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't know
what really helps a person

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:21.087 align:middle line:90%
from any kind of native plant.

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.255 align:middle line:84%
We think all-- well
maybe it's the niacin

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.724 align:middle line:90%
in the soil or whatever.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.526 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the totality
of the plant, everything.

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:31.363 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's something
we will never discover

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:35.234 align:middle line:84%
because the complexity of
life's creation and growth

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and death is way
beyond the comprehension

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.338 align:middle line:90%
of our tiny minds.

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
The universe will not
fit in our heads as much

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.175 align:middle line:90%
as we want to try to do that.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:47.046 align:middle line:90%
We are too slow and too tiny.

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:48.514 align:middle line:90%
The universe is infinite.

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:50.149 align:middle line:90%
Life here on earth is infinite.

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:52.651 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot grasp it
by cutting it into pieces

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.386 align:middle line:84%
and saying we have
now understood it.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:84%
And that's what western
medicine tries to do.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.557 align:middle line:84%
The native shamans, you
go, "How does this work?"

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:00.226 align:middle line:90%
"I don't know, not interested."

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:01.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: All they
know is it does work.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:02.495 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It works.

00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:03.863 align:middle line:90%
Good enough for me.

00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:07.733 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be careful
as well because keep in mind,

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.902 align:middle line:90%
we are the western world.

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:13.205 align:middle line:84%
And we have destroyed
and violated

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:15.307 align:middle line:90%
so many native cultures--

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes, we have.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.511 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- that
nine times out of 10,

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:20.412 align:middle line:84%
the information you
get is to screw us

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.848 align:middle line:90%
up rather than to help us.

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to
find that one person

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:84%
that can see the honesty in
your eyes and the caring,

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:33.492 align:middle line:90%
and the goodwill that you feel.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.593 align:middle line:90%
They will tell you the truth.

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.061 align:middle line:90%
And this is a problem.

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think these
pharmaceutical companies might

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.432 align:middle line:84%
have even bulldozed that
area if they had found

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.467 align:middle line:90%
out what was going on.

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Entirely possible.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And just sequester it.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know, because
you don't want some simple plant

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.811 align:middle line:84%
completely wiping out a trillion
dollars worth of your income--

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:57.349 align:middle line:84%
Where will John McAfee
be not physically,

00:21:57.349 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:84%
but I guess business wise
in the next five years?

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, you know, I'm
still working on my technology,

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:09.762 align:middle line:84%
a company, Future Tense
and the privacy system.

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:14.833 align:middle line:84%
I still-- I'm still madly in
love with natural medicines.

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:18.103 align:middle line:84%
I believe that-- first
of all, there are few

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:21.974 align:middle line:84%
if any modern day medicines
that are not plant-derived.

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:23.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:25.177 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Look at our most
common, aspirin, what is it?

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:25.945 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a bark of--

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:27.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Little tree.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.847 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Little tree
for heaven's sake.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:31.183 align:middle line:84%
Every single advance
in medicine comes not

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:34.653 align:middle line:84%
from some scientists going, "I
think I understand the nature

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:36.555 align:middle line:84%
of life and how to
fix this thing."

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.824 align:middle line:84%
It comes from people
grabbing plants

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:42.094 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "Why
does this work?"

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:44.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.431 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- I say
who cares why it works.

00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's just make the tea like
the natives do and drink it?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And do it, I've
been looking at turmeric

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:53.806 align:middle line:84%
and its research, and
its anti-inflammatory

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:55.174 align:middle line:90%
and anti-cancer properties.

00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I'll tell you two
things that I have discovered

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:58.143 align:middle line:90%
which are fairly miraculous.

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.612 align:middle line:90%
One is called chaga--

00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:00.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:01.947 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- which is
a parasite that grows

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:05.084 align:middle line:84%
on birch trees in that
far, far north in Siberia,

00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:11.423 align:middle line:84%
miraculous for immune
system issues, unbelievable.

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:14.627 align:middle line:84%
The other is the thing
called velvet antler.

00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've not
heard of that.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: OK, elk
antler velvet.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.267 align:middle line:84%
And so here's one of the
major problems we have

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:22.835 align:middle line:90%
with natural medicines.

00:23:22.835 --> 00:23:26.138 align:middle line:84%
In western science, we can take
a compound and write the formula

00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:28.173 align:middle line:90%
and we can all duplicate it.

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:30.943 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But you go to some
shaman in the Northern Siberia

00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:33.045 align:middle line:90%
and he says, "Well, elk antler."

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:35.347 align:middle line:84%
And so you get some--
buy some elk antler

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:84%
at the local store
and it doesn't work.

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.818 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: OK, what
he neglects to tell you

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:42.154 align:middle line:84%
which he thinks any idiot would
know is what you can only do it

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:44.056 align:middle line:84%
during the growth stage
when there's velvet.

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:46.625 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously after
that, it's just dead antler.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's just
the thought, yeah.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:50.062 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And so people
will take elk antler

00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:84%
which is totally useless
because it's a mixture of carbon

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.102 align:middle line:84%
and calcium and a few other
things which you can go

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.538 align:middle line:84%
down to the vitamin
store and get.

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:00.739 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't do anything.

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.875 align:middle line:84%
And so they go, "Well,
this stuff doesn't work?"

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:06.412 align:middle line:84%
But you take the antler at the
stage where it is full of growth

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:07.947 align:middle line:84%
and all the nutrients
are coming in.

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:09.048 align:middle line:90%
It's a different substance.

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:10.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You have
to know that stuff.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Totally miraculous.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So it sounds like
you might form some kind

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:15.554 align:middle line:84%
of natural
supplement business --

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.623 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I have a
partner in Canada,

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:20.025 align:middle line:84%
and we're still using
the Quorum X label.

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.994 align:middle line:84%
I can't use my antibiotics
anymore.

00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:25.798 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still researching
the world over to find things

00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:27.599 align:middle line:84%
that people have
not yet discovered.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:33.405 align:middle line:84%
Or usually if a shaman
or a medicine man

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:35.307 align:middle line:84%
in the wilderness
goes, "This works."

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.409 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does but you
don't know the full story

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:90%
yet, like the elk antler.

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:42.815 align:middle line:84%
So people research things and
say, "Well, it's useless."

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you don't
have all the facts yet.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What's your passion?

00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:48.687 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Anything
which is mysterious,

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:50.389 align:middle line:90%
anything which is new.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:53.625 align:middle line:84%
And to me, anything
new is exciting.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.595 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a piece of
knowledge or a new friendship

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:59.832 align:middle line:84%
or a new language, or a
new culture, a new custom,

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
a new religion, it's
all exciting to me.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
first came back

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:06.305 align:middle line:84%
to the United States,
how happy were you?

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well,
I was pretty happy

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:08.607 align:middle line:90%
to still be alive quite frankly.

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:09.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Happy to be out
of the Guatemalan jail,

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.878 align:middle line:84%
and happy to be out
of the clutches

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:15.014 align:middle line:84%
of a very corrupt
and cruel government.

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:17.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you have a
close net of friends here?

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:20.552 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I do, I have
always made friends easily.

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:22.921 align:middle line:84%
And I adore people,
this is the fact.

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:23.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, you know,
I know when you were

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%
on Coast to Coast with me.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.659 align:middle line:84%
I had tremendous
response after that.

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:31.463 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we beamed you
out to 570 radio stations.

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:34.033 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, they just
loved your attitude

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.768 align:middle line:90%
about life and stuff like that.

00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.069 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know,
I love life, George.

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:39.071 align:middle line:90%
I think we all would love life

00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
if we opened our hearts
and arms to it.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Ever have a bad day?

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, yeah, if I
look at it from one angle.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.045 align:middle line:90%
But looking out after the fact,

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:50.983 align:middle line:84%
there was always either an
educational day or a day full

00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:90%
of adventure or excitement.

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What's your
health regimen like?

00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:90%
What you do?

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.955 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know, I
hate to say this also--

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: 'Cause,
how old are you?

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.291 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I'm 68.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:02.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And you look 50.

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:03.162 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I thank
you very much.

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:04.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Maybe a little less.

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.432 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well yeah, I don't
know what that could be from.

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:09.768 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a dietary regimen.

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:12.504 align:middle line:90%
I think that what we eat is

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:14.273 align:middle line:84%
of crucial importance
to our health.

00:26:14.273 --> 00:26:15.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:16.842 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: There are basically
three things what we eat,

00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:19.711 align:middle line:84%
how we sleep, and
what is our environment?

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:23.415 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're working in
a coal factory, without a mask

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:26.084 align:middle line:84%
or a filter, you're going to
be sick no matter what you do.

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:29.221 align:middle line:84%
If you dodn't eat the
right foods, you're going

00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:30.989 align:middle line:84%
to be sick no matter
where you live.

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:34.693 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't sleep, you're
just going to be sick, period.

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:36.695 align:middle line:90%
But the key is what do you eat?

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:41.166 align:middle line:84%
Do you eat vegetarian
or animal products or--

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And who do you trust?

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:43.402 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And who do you trust?

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:44.636 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the issue.

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:46.438 align:middle line:84%
You can only trust one
person, and that's yourself.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good point.

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:50.342 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And I think most
people don't pay attention

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:51.343 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.945 align:middle line:84%
They don't pay attention
to their body.

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:55.147 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have any regimen.

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:56.348 align:middle line:90%
I listen to my body.

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if my body wants a
hot dog, I eat a hot dog.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.419 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't last one for
that very often by the way--

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, I'm
the same way.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.921 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: OK--

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Nothing like
a nice Chicago style hot dog.

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:06.058 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That's right,
but I listen to my body.

00:27:06.058 --> 00:27:10.429 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it will-- it
says, "I want salad," you know,

00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:12.631 align:middle line:84%
and for three days, I'll
eat nothing but salads.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.599 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:14.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you
supplement yourself?

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.002 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Not often, I found

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:21.006 align:middle line:84%
that taking vitamins
frequently upsets my stomach.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.841 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: OK, which tells me

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:23.976 align:middle line:84%
that maybe I don't
need these things.

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.043 align:middle line:90%
The body is a very--

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:26.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The body tells you.

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:27.546 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Your body is
an intelligent organism.

00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:30.182 align:middle line:84%
You know, we listen
to our brains.

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:31.683 align:middle line:90%
Much, much, too much.

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:34.386 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, our brains
and our thoughts are designed

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:37.623 align:middle line:84%
for one thing only,
to navigate the world.

00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:39.224 align:middle line:84%
How do I get from
here back to my car?

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:41.293 align:middle line:84%
How do I get my car
back to my house?

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:43.095 align:middle line:90%
How do I balance my checkbook?

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:45.697 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we use it to
try to reason things

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that we have no business
reasoning.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.202 align:middle line:90%
What should we eat?

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:52.004 align:middle line:90%
Shut the brain down on that one.

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:54.006 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the body,
it will tell you.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:56.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: If a genie gave
John McAfee one wish,

00:27:56.742 --> 00:27:57.476 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: My Lord.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: One wish.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:04.283 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know, I
would have said 15 years ago

00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:05.851 align:middle line:90%
eternal life.

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that
would become a curse

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.688 align:middle line:90%
of the highest order.

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:10.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A highlander.

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.458 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You're right, it
would simply be a curse.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:14.826 align:middle line:90%
You know, I don't know anymore.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.328 align:middle line:90%
I don't have wishes.

00:28:16.328 --> 00:28:20.265 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy just to wake up the
next day and still be breathing

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and alive and capable of
communing and smiling.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.638 align:middle line:90%
This is what life is.

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.241 align:middle line:84%
It should be about
laughter and friendship

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:31.043 align:middle line:90%
and smiles and goodwill.

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I wake up in the
morning and go, "Got through,

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:34.146 align:middle line:90%
got through the night."

00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:34.846 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Me too.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Another day.

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:38.317 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I'm still breathing--
success, so that's it.

00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:39.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You enjoy working?

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:40.185 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I love to work.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:40.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's fun.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I love it.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Same with me.

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:45.591 align:middle line:90%
Like I've done all my life--

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:46.592 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: You can have--

00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:47.726 align:middle line:84%
you have the charisma
and the energy,

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.663 align:middle line:84%
and the passion that's
necessary for your job.

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:53.865 align:middle line:90%
So I know you love this.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:58.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: If you could change
one thing on this planet

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:03.075 align:middle line:84%
as we wrap this up, one
thing, what would that be?

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:06.745 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I would remove
fear from the formula.

00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:10.549 align:middle line:84%
Because without fear, I
think everything else would--

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
all the ugliness would
drop away.

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:84%
If you were not afraid
of your enemy

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.992 align:middle line:84%
or the person you think is your
enemy, if you weren't fearful

00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
of losing your job, losing
your wife, losing your comfort,

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.999 align:middle line:90%
you would open up more to life.

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That is so true.

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.668 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Instead of
being afraid of someone

00:29:29.668 --> 00:29:31.703 align:middle line:84%
who is dressed strangely
wearing a turban

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:34.072 align:middle line:84%
and speaks a foreign language,
you would open up to them

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:36.141 align:middle line:84%
and go, "Wow, where
did you come from?

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.809 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
like you.

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:39.378 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about yourself."

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:41.113 align:middle line:90%
Instead we go, uh--

00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:42.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you know
what, they eat, they cry,

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.383 align:middle line:90%
they sleep just like we do.

00:29:44.383 --> 00:29:46.351 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They have the
same things, the same things,

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
they love, they hope,
they dream,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.324 align:middle line:84%
they have ambition,
they have grace.

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:53.625 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
our negatives,

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:57.729 align:middle line:90%
fear and envy and all anger.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing that,
we should be gentle

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.971 align:middle line:84%
and we should be welcoming,
and we should hug and soothe.

00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:07.806 align:middle line:84%
Instead we go, "Oh, you're --
something wrong with you.

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.574 align:middle line:90%
You know, you need to-- "

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think
wars should be fought

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.246 align:middle line:84%
by the politicians who star
them. Put them in a room.

00:30:14.246 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I do too.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.448 align:middle line:84%
Give them whatever weapon
they want.

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:17.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: There would be no war.

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:18.717 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: In fact,
we should make it--

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:84%
we should make a
sport out of that.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:23.088 align:middle line:84%
If we want entertainment I'm
saying, we've made entertainment

00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:24.456 align:middle line:90%
out of the wrong things.

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:26.858 align:middle line:84%
Well, take our leaders, put
them in a big arena, you know,

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:29.494 align:middle line:84%
and we get to pay, you
know, 10 dollars to watch.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.896 align:middle line:90%
Now that would be entertainment.

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:33.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: John McAfee, thank you
so much for being on the show.

00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:33.965 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Thank you, George.

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.167 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: John McAfee,
our guest on Beyond Belief

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:41.339 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see you on our next
edition of Beyond Belief.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:90%
