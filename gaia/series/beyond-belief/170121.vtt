00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and we have an
amazing guest for you tonight.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn has had
an extensive background

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%
as a master craftsman.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
He was recruited by an American
aerospace company where

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
he has worked at almost
every level of high tech

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:10%
manufacturing.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Then he decided to
pursue something else.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, he's been
investigating the Giza Pyramid

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:90%
area in Egypt.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:10%
He has written several
books, "The Giza Power Plant"

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:10%
and also "Lost Technologies
of Ancient Egypt."

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Chris, welcome to the program.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with us.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOPHER DUNN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate being here.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What amazing
research you've done.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Now how did you get
interested in the pyramids

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:90%
and the structures there?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I would
go back 40 years.

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 years?

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:10%
1977, I was reading
Peter Tompkins'

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:10%
book, "Secrets of
the Great Pyramid,"

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:10%
and as I was reading
that book, it

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:10%
occurred to me that the
Great Pyramid seemed

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:10%
to have an order of
precision and engineering

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
that was a lot higher than
a primitive culture would

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:10%
actually produce if you consider
using copper chisels and stone

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:10%
balls to be
primitive, which I do.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though they may be
sophisticated in other ways,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
those are the only
tools that have

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
been found in the
archaeological record

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and which Egyptologists
claim were

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
used in the creation of
all the marvelous artifacts

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:90%
that you find in Egypt.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, you have
been to Egypt several times.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:54.705 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you walk
up next to the pyramids,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:90%
how awe-inspiring is that?

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's a
very interesting question.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:10%
I could relate that
to the first time

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:10%
I went to Egypt,
which was in 1986.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And I had already
developed some ideas

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:10%
and done a lot of reading
about the Great Pyramid,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:10%
and it was almost like I was
afraid to go up to the plateau

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:10%
to visit the pyramid.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:90%
I circled it for three days.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
was there for three days

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
before I actually went up there.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was awe-inspiring,
and even today it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:90%
is a magical place to be.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.675 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing
feat of human endeavor.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, I know.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: The engineering, the
precision is outstanding.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even today,
we don't build

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to that order of
precision that they

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:90%
build the Great Pyramid to.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have long
believed that the pyramids were

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:90%
power plants.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Explain that, and what
were they powering up?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yes, my impression as
I was reading Tompkins' book

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and also doing other research
was that the pyramids had

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
the precision of a machine,
and so therefore it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
would have had the
function of a machine.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And based on that
premise, and also

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
considering the very details and
schematics of the Great Pyramid

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
do not represent any structure
where human activity would take

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
place, whether it
be a temple or even

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
a tomb-- which, you know, they
call it a tomb-- there are so

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
many anomalies involved
in that building

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that it just didn't make sense.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And so based on the premise
that it was a machine,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I considered it to
be a power plant.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the anomaly and
phenomena of power in that area

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
has been discussed
for many years.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And so based on that, I wondered
how each particular feature

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
within the pyramid would have
contributed to that endeavor,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:90%
to actually create power.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher, if
they drew the energy out

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.666 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, for example,
through the pyramids, any idea

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:90%
what they would use it for?

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: They could use it
for just about anything

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that their imagination
devised, or they could just

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
draw it out and waste it.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they
had flying machines,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and this was used
to power them up?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, even that.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even today
they are discussing

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the concept of
launching spacecraft

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and reducing the
fuel it has to carry

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.625 align:middle line:84%
and actually feeding it with
microwave energy in flight.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.916 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, same kind of
technique, that's possible.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, so I
wouldn't put it past them.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
reluctance in the modern era

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
to accept the fact that the
Egyptians might have possessed

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.445 align:middle line:90%
incredible technologies.

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at the architecture
of structures from ancient

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Egypt stimulates
a sense of wonder.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, Egyptian monuments
rival the grandeur of our most

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
modern buildings today.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Yet we are taught
to believe that we

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
are the ones with knowledge
of high technology, something

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.029 align:middle line:84%
the ancients could
not possibly have had.

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:10%
>>CARMEN BOULTER:
As long as we think

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:10%
that the ancients weren't
able to use high technology,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:10%
then we're not looking for it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:10%
And yet the evidence is
right in front of our eyes.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't we
accept that overall?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think it's
the order of progression

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.153 align:middle line:84%
of how civilizations have
progressed on the earth.

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.236 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we in denial?

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It seems to be-- it's
more of a Western-based point

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it started
with the Greeks and the Romans,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of vaguely
refer back to the Egyptians.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But the Greeks and the
Romans were the found--

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the foundation
of Western civilization.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think the interpretation
of the monuments

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
has always been with the view
that the Egyptians did not

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
rise to the level of those
later cultures, the Greeks

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Romans.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you actually go
to Egypt and, as an engineer

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and a craftsman, and you look
at the quality of the work

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that they were
doing, you can see

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were much
more advanced in what

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
they were able to produce.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And obviously,
Christopher, before they

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
built the pyramids, somebody
had to schematically draw things

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
out in order to develop
a plan when they put

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:90%
it together architecturally.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
How was that done?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the little crevices
and the little areas

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.599 align:middle line:84%
and the tombs and the shafts
are just magnificently laid out.

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
a very important point

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
to make in that
the Great Pyramid

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and how it is constructed and
the design and precision of it,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
it could not have taken
place-- it could not

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
have been built
without some protocol

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:90%
without some drawings or plans.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, the forethought
must have been amazing.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It's a way to transmit
information to people who

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
are going to perform the work.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So, while you may conceive of
a product or an engineering

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
product like the
Great Pyramid, you

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
have to transmit your
knowledge of the information

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and your design criteria
and the specifications

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.015 align:middle line:84%
to a myriad of other
people, different trades,

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether
they be skilled

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
trades, semi-skilled
trades, laborers, whatever.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
That information has
to be transmitted

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.719 align:middle line:84%
so they would have had to have
had a way of transmitting that.

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
it be great to find

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the architectural schematics
of the great pyramids?

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
And what would that show
us if we could find that?

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, I think
if you were able to find it,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
the question is how did--
how did they record it?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, today, well, when I
started off with engineering,

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
information was transmitted
via drawings on paper.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Today--

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
they have done, papyrus?

00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Today we use computers.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We hold that knowledge
on hard drives, on disks,

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.862 align:middle line:90%
and flash drives.

00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll trans--
you know, hold it

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
on the cloud or
something like that.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have means of transmitting
information that's a lot

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
different today than
what it was 50 years ago.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
How they did it in ancient
Egypt, I don't know.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.275 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure they didn't
draw it out in the sand.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
something else going on.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You see, this
is the thing, George.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
What you have with
the Great Pyramid

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually the perfect
example of the sophistication

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
of the culture.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And yet when we
start to try and analyze

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
how they created this structure
and how they transmitted

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
information, we
fall back to methods

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that are less sophisticated
than the structure actually

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:90%
tells us.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, it's
like the state of the art

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:90%
then was very high.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I can imagine the
methods that they used

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and the ancillary
trades and products

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
were similarly
sophisticated and advanced.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did we
lose the knowledge

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:90%
of how they built these?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
What happened to this gap
and how did it get there?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: I think it's a--

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's kind of
like we develop along

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
a particular line.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We'll have significant
personalities

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of our people with genius
that come among us in society,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:90%
and they present ideas.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They develop formulas.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
They develop technologies, and
those technologies are adopted,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and then they become
embedded in our culture.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But they follow a particular
idea, a particular method

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:90%
of doing things.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
that they, you know,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that path could have gone on
a totally different direction,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and our products today
will be entirely different.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We may be achieving
the same thing

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
but doing it in a different way.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's just, you
know, sometimes, I mean,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
nature sometimes dictates how we
do things, nature and physics.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We can't violate
the laws of physics,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
if we consider-- if we know
what all those laws are.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which we're learning
every day more and more.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been
recent discoveries of voids

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:90%
in some of these chambers.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a
little bit about that.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, yes,
just recently they

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
had a team in the
Great Pyramid, and they

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
were using
muonography, muons that

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
are created by the
interaction of cosmic rays

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that actually pass
through matter.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And the amount that
passes through the matter

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is determined by
the density of it.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a muon that's
passing through solid stone,

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and it impacts a target, then
you have a certain signature.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
If there are voids,
then those voids

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
can be detected by the rate
of the number of muons that

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:90%
actually impact the target.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.345 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The voids that were
discovered are actually

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:90%
above the Grand Gallery.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly they
signify a chamber

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:90%
that is about 100 feet long.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about it is

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that when you consider it in the
context of the Giza power plant

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
theory, for myself, the
jury's still out on that

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
location that you can

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:90%
see looking from east to west.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing that I've
seen that shows north to south.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So while that void exists,
it's assumed that it's

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:90%
above the Grand Gallery.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But is it displaced
east or west?

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't know because
it's within that view.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the other question
about the technology

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:90%
is that the resolution.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
What is the resolution?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you know, you

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.545 align:middle line:84%
have to consider the
trajectory of the muons.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:09.295 align:middle line:90%
Are they coming in on an angle?

00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:90%
What are their true dimensions?

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is that
significant if they're

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
coming in at an angle?

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, if
you pass through anything,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
if you're not looking
at it straight on, then

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions could be
exaggerated because it passes

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
through at this point, and then
it's on an angle so it looks

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
larger when it--

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like going through a
lens or something like that.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
It could look smaller or larger.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But the location of it
is very interesting.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested
to learn what

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
they find when they do
further explorations,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and I hope they do fairly soon.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think they will.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:10%
What are the chambers
like inside the pyramids

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:10%
because they have
these little long tubes

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:10%
of chambers and things?

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's one
of the unique features

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid are
those, what you call, tubes.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:10%
Specifically if you talk
about the Queen's Chamber

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:10%
in the Great Pyramid,
that has these tubes

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:10%
that are going up on an angle
but don't exit the pyramid.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.592 align:middle line:10%
That was one of the mysteries.

00:15:21.592 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And there are two
of the shafts that

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:10%
go up on the north side and
the south side of the chamber.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long are they?

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: I'd say about 200 and--

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
about 200 feet.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Long.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.781 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By what,
a couple of feet?

00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: They don't exit.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
No, they're only about
eight inches square.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then in the King's
Chamber, you have two shafts.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
One is about 8.4 inches
wide by 4.8 inches high,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and that shaft
goes to the north.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then on the south side,
you have a large opening

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
in the wall that looks
like a catcher's mitt,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:90%
like a horn antenna.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have carried
water or mercury or anything

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, if you--

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.665 align:middle line:84%
any conduit can carry any
solution you put in it.

00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:13.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:13.465 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But the question
is, was that the reason?

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They have been, I think,
incorrectly labeled air shafts.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But the
problem with that

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
is, particularly with
the Queen's Chamber,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have carried any
air because they were closed.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
So why did they exist?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I address
in my book, "The Giza Power

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.372 align:middle line:84%
Plant," just what the
purpose of those shafts is.

00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And exactly
what do you think it was?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, if you take
the whole pyramid and all

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the features within
the pyramid, I actually

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
created a scenario where the
Great Pyramid is in harmony

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.565 align:middle line:84%
or resonating with the earth
and drawing energy through it.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
That energy is then transferred
into airborne sound.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
The power center is
the King's Chamber,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
and it's constructed
out of granite,

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:90%
thousands of tons of granite.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
And then the Queen's Chamber was
where they created a hydrogen

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
with two solutions
coming in from the north

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:90%
side and the south side.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:84%
They mix, and they
create hydrogen.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And there's evidence
to support my theory.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:10%
I think we've talked in the past
about Gantenbrink's door, where

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:10%
they found those--

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.434 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's the one
they drilled through.

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Yes, exactly.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there's more
information on that, I think,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:90%
that was revealed in 2011.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
think they cut the stone?

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
an interesting question

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
pieces of evidence

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that I discovered in 2006
and included in my book,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
"Lost Technologies
of Ancient Egypt,"

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
describes them
using circular saws.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Circular saws?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Circular saws.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big?

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, the
evidence clearly

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
shows that the saw must have
been over 37 feet in diameter.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A 37-foot saw?

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And they had to have had
something to power this thing.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the revolutions to
cut through that kind of stone

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:90%
must have been astronomical.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, not necessarily
the revolutions but,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even as a
slow revolution,

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
the surface feet per minute,
the cutting edge of the saw

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.607 align:middle line:90%
would be sufficient.

00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you wouldn't have
to turn it very quickly.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.954 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the material
be to have constructed the saw?

00:18:51.954 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Obviously,
they would have

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.230 align:middle line:84%
had to have used a material that
was harder than the granite.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And what we looked for--

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a big
diamond if that's what it is.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But I mean, they create
saws today to cut granite,

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and they embed diamond
in its substrate,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and it cuts very efficiently.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.041 align:middle line:84%
But it's a matter
of saying, you know,

00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
if you have a mega project
like building a pyramid--

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Then you actually create
mega machines to accomplish it.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind of like a
revolutionary concept in that

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the picture that has
been kind of transmitted

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.909 align:middle line:84%
to us over the years of
how pyramids were built--

00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just remarkable.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Have been
people with, you know,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
these stone balls or
chisels and, you know,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
just banging away at the blocks.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence
shows otherwise.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:58.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would a 37-foot
circular saw be right now?

00:19:58.047 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Where would they put that?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's a good question
because when you consider

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
the thousands of years since
the pyramid was built, I mean,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
there are different scenarios
that you can imagine.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
If the pyramid was-- if
the pyramid was completed,

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the people who built
it would take the saw,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, take it apart because
I'm assuming that something

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that large would
come in sections.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And you would
assemble it on site.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And take it apart.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And then there's evidence on the
Giza plateau and Abu Rawash--

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:10%
Abu Rawash has clear
evidence of this 37-foot saw.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Clearly.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do other people
see this or just you, Chris?

00:20:38.857 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I've seen
it, and other people

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:90%
have seen it and verified it.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Other engineers-- I've taken
engineers to Abu Rawash

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and showed it to them.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the two people that
I took there looked at it

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and read my analysis
on it and said,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
well, this is like
a new Rosetta Stone.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Because it
describes a culture

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that is much more advanced,
and it's hard evidence.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The masonry techniques
also were incredible.

00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yep.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Bronze and copper tools of
the time are, at first sight,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:90%
too soft.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Yet a sarcophagus or
coffin makes it clear

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
that ancient Masons
could cut straight edges.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Close up, there are
striations, marks made

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:90%
by the movement of a hard edge.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Mark challenges one of the
team to show him the answer.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: All right.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a big block
of granite here.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.272 align:middle line:84%
So how's this copper
going to cut this granite?

00:21:40.272 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS STOCKS:
We're going to use

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the saw in a reciprocating or
backwards and forward motion.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Dennis Stocks, an expert
in ancient technology,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.095 align:middle line:84%
suggests the Egyptians had
a trick up their sleeves.

00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STOCKS: Helps us
all get started.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: So you're
going to chip a groove,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.284 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going
to put the copper

00:21:56.284 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
and slide it back and forth.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to cut the granite?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STOCKS: No, Mark.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Even with teeth, the
copper alone is too soft.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.231 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: OK, well,
what is actually

00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:90%
going to do the cutting.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that copper is
just going to blunt on granite.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe it's
going to cut the stone.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STOCKS: We're going to
put sand inside the groove.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to put
this saw on top of the sand

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and then let the
sand do the cutting.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
All that needs to be
done is to move the saw

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.137 align:middle line:84%
backwards and forwards
in a nice steady motion.

00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: You don't want
to lift it up and get

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.900 align:middle line:90%
those grains in there.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STOCKS: No, they'll work
themselves in as he goes.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Now the stone weight
at each end of the saw

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
are putting the load onto the
sand and causes the cutting.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.375 align:middle line:84%
The crystal is forced to
score a groove in the stone.

00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: So the copper is
only guiding the sand.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:90%
The sand's doing the cutting.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.874 align:middle line:90%
>>STOCKS: Right.

00:22:51.874 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
all well and good,

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Christopher, but
that would take a lot

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of going back and forth
to cut those blocks we

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
see in the pyramids.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.936 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yes, and that
particular method

00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
does not explain the evidence
because the evidence indicates

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that the saw was moving through
the material at a higher speed

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:10%
And the striations on the
stone with that method,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:10%
you would not be able to move
the saw through very quickly.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might have been
used for smaller blocks maybe?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I mean, I
think if you had--

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.081 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or just toss
the whole theory out.

00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think if-- no, if
you have the technology--

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
if you have the technology
to cut the stones

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and leave the striations
on the large blocks

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen in Egypt,
there's no reason for you

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.514 align:middle line:84%
to revert to a method like
that to cut smaller blocks.

00:23:47.514 --> 00:23:49.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's
something in the Petrie

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:10%
Museum, some kind of granite
core with spiral grooves.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:10%
What is that all about?

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: That was a--

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:10%
William Flinders Petrie
discovered that at Giza

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:10%
in 1881.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called,
"Pyramids and Temples of Giza."

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It was published in 1883, and
he described this core as being

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
tapered and that the
drill, whatever drilled it,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
had per revolution of the
drill, it cut about 100,000s per

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:90%
revolution.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So for every revolution down,
it sank into the granite

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:90%
about one eighth of an inch.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is an amazing
and tremendous speed rate.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's great
science, wasn't it?

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, it would
have been science--

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
science, engineering, tech
techniques, technology.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
mysterious object.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And at first, when
I analyzed it,

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought that it may have been
cut using ultrasonic machining.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But since I received
a latex impression

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
of the outside of the core and
examined the grooves in it,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:90%
it is spiral.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost as though
parts of it have melted.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:84%
There was some application of
heat or something like that.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: -- assist
in the cutting.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very mysterious
object for sure.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher, what
about the moving of the blocks?

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's remarkable that
they may have had power saws--

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.686 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
move these things?

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.423 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
one of the things

00:25:44.423 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:10%
that really when we look at
how the pyramids were built,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:10%
and we look at how
they moved obelisks

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:10%
and these massive statues
somewhere, weighing 1,000 tons,

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:10%
how were they moved?

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And how did they
build the pyramid,

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, in a short period of
time when some of the blocks

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:90%
weigh--

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:06.813 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tons.

00:26:06.813 --> 00:26:07.613 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: 70 tons.

00:26:07.613 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tons.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.599 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: And taking blocks to a--

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We couldn't
move them today.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Oh, well,
I mean, I wouldn't

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
say that we couldn't if we
had a purpose to do that.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 200 tons, they've
lifted 100-ton vessels,

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, nuclear vessels
to a higher elevation.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.902 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the cranes
were huge to lift them.

00:26:31.902 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, the
cranes were huge.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there are people
who specialize in lifting,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
crane drivers and what they call
riggers who will analyze a site

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and determine what they need
to move a block from point A

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to point B. And
the company I work

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
for had moved a 100-ton
press into the plant.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that was quite
an ordeal, where

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:84%
they had to bring a crane down
in sections on five semi loads

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.545 align:middle line:90%
and then assemble it.

00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just remarkable.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And so for
five days, they

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
were bringing these pieces
in and assembling it.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they actually
picked the load

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and dropped it into the plant.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they
had extraterrestrial help?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.466 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You know,
there has been--

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that has been-- it seems to have
been a popular idea that people

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:90%
have attached to it.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I tend to--

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:40.405 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think more along
the lines of a more advanced

00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:41.205 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.085 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Such as, say,
our civilization.

00:27:47.085 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That kind
of technology.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: If we have--

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.525 align:middle line:10%
there is a lot--

00:27:51.525 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the technology
that we see in Egypt,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to
cutting and shaping,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:10%
we have the tools today
to be able to do that.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:90%
The lifting is another matter.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And so while it's possible to
do it, what the methods are,

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I think they would use
a more efficient method.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.857 align:middle line:84%
I think they actually had
levitation technologies,

00:28:22.857 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:90%
anti-gravity technologies.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sound
resonance, something.

00:28:25.645 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Now I don't--

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I don't want to
escape your previous question

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:90%
on the extraterrestrial help.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.405 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.405 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
That idea, I have not seen
any credible information

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:90%
that would prove that.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's hard.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to evidence
and the analysis of evidence,

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we have to assume
that this planet--

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
the genius of the human race
is evident in all cultures

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.146 align:middle line:90%
throughout--

00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:08.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:08.002 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Throughout history,
whether you go back millennia,

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:90%
and civilization is cyclical.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And we go through cycles of
the rise of a civilization

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:90%
and the fall of civilization.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, whether
it's extraterrestrial impacts

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
like a comet strike, which it
seems like there's evidence

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
for that now, it will destroy
a large section of society

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes throw the
whole planet back in time.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, today if it happened,
we could be thrown back

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to being a medieval society.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they had
levitation technology,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
how might that have worked?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:84%
If I knew the answer to
that, I'd be a billionaire.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you would.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they had
that kind of technology?

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: I do.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think the methods used by
Edward Leedskalnin in Florida.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You know, who--
he built Coral Castle.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.829 align:middle line:90%
That is a subject to itself.

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We could talk for an
hour through all that.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He said he knew
the secrets of the pyramids.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Exactly.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.417 align:middle line:90%
And his place is a mystery, too.

00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.041 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I've been down
there several times.

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely think
that they had that.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that technology
was used probably

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:84%
widely across the
planet because we

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.710 align:middle line:84%
have many of these like
impossible structures

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
where they were moving
extremely, extremely

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:90%
large rocks.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are
those structures

00:30:41.255 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that are around the
planet similar to Giza?

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Some are
similar, but they're not.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look at Giza
and Egypt as being the--

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like they had
developed their manufacturing

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
technology to a
higher level that you

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
find in other areas
like, you know,

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the standing stones in England,
or if you go to France.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: In Peru, there's
evidence of precise cutting,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't seem to have
the same geometric format

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
or protocol that
you find in Egypt.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The three-dimensional precise
curves that you have in Egypt,

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you may find square
blocks in Peru, Bolivia.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Puma Punku is a fine
example of precise cutting.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But the magnitude
of the techniques

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is all centered in
Egypt, in my opinion.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything like this
happening today anywhere?

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, you have--

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as far as
working in stone,

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:84%
of course, we're looking
into our ancient past,

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at the
skeleton of a civilization.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: What we create
essentially is in steel,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
metals, that would
erode over time.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they probably wouldn't
exist 10,000 years from now.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But what we do today with
our machines is similar.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could achieve
the same precision,

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:84%
the same quality of cuts
using modern equipment as what

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians
were using for sure.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
to your original theory

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that it's a power plant.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it powering?

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
What was the power
being used for?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I would assume
that whatever technologies

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that they had that they could
have used electricity to power

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
That isn't like a huge question.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.504 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
chicken and the egg.

00:33:13.504 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
What came first, the
chicken or the egg?

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But how do
you build the pyramid?

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, you say you
use power tools.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But where did
the power come from?

00:33:23.917 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Where did
your power come from

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to build the power plant?

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, today where does
our power come from

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:90%
to build the power plant?

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
If they know about
electricity, they

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:84%
know how to create
electricity, and they

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.430 align:middle line:84%
know how to create
power tools, and they're

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:90%
building with that technology.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But the pyramid power plant
or the energy from that,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean your imagination today,
you have a lot of corollaries.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
Tesla and what

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:84%
he proposed in terms of
the wireless transmission

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Giza power plants,
the energy being created

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is a microwave being that comes
out of the southern shaft.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:84%
At that point where it
exits the southern shaft,

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
there's very little
evidence at Giza

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to describe what
happened at that point.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It could have been beamed into
outer space, been transmitted

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:90%
to another point.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:39.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:39.881 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: --on the planet.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.485 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have been
transferred, you know,

00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:84%
or spread into the
atmosphere where

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:84%
it could have been collected,
like a Wardenclyffe

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Tower, the Tesla technology.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:10%
So any kind of means that
we have devised today

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:10%
we can compare
and say, yeah, OK,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:10%
if we know that this
power is being generated,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:10%
then we can assume that
they had figured out a way,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.320 align:middle line:10%
or they had a need for it.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, why create
it in the first place?

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact
that the gap is there,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and the information
is literally gone.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.161 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is not to take away

00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
from your research and
the research of others.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But it really is gone because
everything is just speculation

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:90%
and theory now.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm baffled, Chris, as
to how it just simply vanished

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and disappeared.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to think that
some horrible calamity occurred,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a nuke war or
something that obliterated

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.670 align:middle line:90%
that gap between then and now.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:36:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yes, and obviously there
seems to be a time in history

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
when they were
actually doing work.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:11.174 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were working on
projects, and everything ended.

00:36:11.174 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Something
happened suddenly,

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
able to continue.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind of related
to the pyramids in a way,

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and how the pyramids were tuned
to the earth, and the purpose

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
had developed is they

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:84%
had developed what I would
call a tuned instrument.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.370 align:middle line:84%
If you consider
the Great Pyramid

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
as being like a
musical instrument,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.580 align:middle line:84%
a finely-tuned
instrument, and it

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:84%
is drawing energy from the
earth and the designers

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of this pyramid
and this science.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I calculated the
amount of energy

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that they could bring
through the pyramid

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:90%
and having function.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Enormous,
had to be enormous.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.170 align:middle line:90%
But it was a certain amount.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:10%
There's only a certain amount
of energy that that pyramid--

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Had the capacity for.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Had the capacity
to handle and pass through.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Now if you-- but that's because
the earth is a known quantity.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a closed system.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
comet strike that

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:84%
comes in and hits
the planet, then you

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
have the introduction
of an enormous amount

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of additional energy.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the pyramids weren't
able to pass through that energy

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.230 align:middle line:84%
or handle that energy, and they
just started to shake apart

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and were destroyed at
that point, as well

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.240 align:middle line:84%
as a lot of the rest
of the civilization.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the pyramids,
in your opinion, finished?

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Were they completed?

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: From what
I've seen, there

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.685 align:middle line:90%
is one that was not completed.

00:38:00.685 --> 00:38:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And that
was at Abu Rawash.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that they
were in the process

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of creating that pyramid
and everything stopped.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, in that area,
they had these granite blocks,

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
like boulders,

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
sitting out as though
being collected,

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
ready to be cut, and
put into position.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.795 align:middle line:84%
So that pyramid appears
to be unfinished.

00:38:25.795 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And then you also
have the unfinished obelisk,

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.510 align:middle line:90%
which is another enigma.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 1,200-ton obelisk
still attached to the bedrock.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1,200-tons.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: 1,200 tons.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they just
stopped with that one.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, they
stopped with that one.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the conventional
theories, they

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
claim that they stopped
because it developed a fissure.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But they had already gone
to a tremendous amount

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
of work and cutting
around that obelisk.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, why stop?

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: That even if it--

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:05.409 align:middle line:84%
even if it didn't serve
as an obelisk anymore,

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:84%
there was enough
stone there that you

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:84%
could have used for
other projects, building

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.250 align:middle line:90%
projects, and stuff like that.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.764 align:middle line:90%
So obviously everything stopped.

00:39:14.764 --> 00:39:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris,
researcher David Hatcher

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Childress has explored Egypt.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.982 align:middle line:84%
And there was a region in Egypt
that he looked at as well.

00:39:22.982 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID HATCHER
CHILDRESS: Yeah, here you

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:90%
can see the lid pushed back.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.020 align:middle line:90%
The sarcophagus is open.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
It's been chipped
away right here

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:90%
probably trying to open it.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
According to the
traditional Egyptologists,

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:84%
these giant boxes
were sarcophagi

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
for the mummified bulls
of Apis, the sacred bulls

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Egypt.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Yet the big mystery
really is how

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.210 align:middle line:90%
they could possibly get boxes--

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:84%
such gigantic, 85-ton
basalt sarcophagi

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
like this in here
and, in theory, just

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to put a mummified bull inside.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.544 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
sarcophagus was huge.

00:40:17.544 --> 00:40:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, they are.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, what was it a
giant that they put in there?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's a
very good question.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:28.810 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think they were
built to mummify or hold

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:32.240 align:middle line:90%
any bodies at all.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I first went into
that facility--

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:84%
it's at the Serapeum, which
is near Saqqara, and it's--

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close
is that to Giza?

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Oh, it's about 20 miles.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, not far.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It's about--
and it's underground

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:84%
so the whole facility is
dug out of the bedrock.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And you walk down a passageway
and into these tunnels.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And along the walls
of the tunnels--

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%
they're like vaulted tunnels--

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and they have these
crypts cut into the walls.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is everything a
mystery in Egypt, Chris?

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: There's a lot
of mystery there, yes.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But those boxes are
significant, and I had actually

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:84%
attempted to see how precise
they were because they appeared

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.560 align:middle line:90%
to be very precise to me.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had a toolmakers square,
and the inside surfaces--

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I won't say
perfect, but they

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:50.840 align:middle line:84%
were within what I would
consider to be a tolerance that

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:84%
was kind of equal to the
precision of the instrument I

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:90%
was using.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the
purpose of that place be?

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Oh, you know,
one person's guess

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:90%
is as good as another.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you have
these gigantic boxes,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:90%
and there's over 20 of them.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And the insides were
crafted so precisely

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:10%
that the lids were so heavy,
and where the lid actually

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.740 align:middle line:10%
met the top of the
box, you couldn't even

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.245 align:middle line:10%
get a light to shine through it.

00:42:33.245 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was that tight.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It was that-- it
was that precise, yeah.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an enormous-- it's
a tremendous accomplishment.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But the insides are parallel,
too, so the opposing surfaces

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:90%
are parallel.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Where you have the underside
of the lid, and you know,

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:84%
you put a square on the
other side of the lid,

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and you see it's very powerful
from one side to the other.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And what they would need
to accomplish that--

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.405 align:middle line:84%
even to measure it and to
maintain that tolerance--

00:43:07.405 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's just--

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It far exceeds
what has been found

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.540 align:middle line:90%
in the archaeological record.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So what were they
using them for?

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that vibration
had something

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.400 align:middle line:90%
to do with it because the--

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anti-gravity?

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Certainly anti-gravity
getting them down in there.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But vibration in
how they function,

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:84%
that because each of
the boxes was inserted

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:90%
into a recess in the floor.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
reason they had--

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.644 align:middle line:84%
there was a reason why
they had to have that set--

00:43:42.644 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Built in like that.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: So that
it wouldn't move.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And if you have
vibration going on,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
things that are
laying on the surface

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
they could kind of walk
across the surface.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.994 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have been
earthquake shock absorbers?

00:43:59.994 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Oh, that's a--

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I think actually the
pyramids are earthquake shock

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:90%
absorbers--

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:84%
shock absorbers, if you
look at it that way,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:20.270 align:middle line:84%
except they function to try
to eliminate earthquakes,

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, relieve the
stresses in the earth's plates

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:84%
so that they pass smoothly
over each other and don't bind.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:10%
And basically that's
how earthquakes

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:10%
happen is that the plates
do not move smoothly.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:39.190 align:middle line:10%
They stick, and then
suddenly they will release,

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.402 align:middle line:10%
and that's what causes
the displacement.

00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think, Christopher,

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.480 align:middle line:84%
if we ever really find out
the purpose of these pyramids,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.610 align:middle line:84%
we can then get other
answers in terms

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:90%
of how were they constructed?

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:58.345 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I think, I
mean, your question is counter

00:44:58.345 --> 00:45:01.265 align:middle line:84%
to my position on
it because I think--

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
you know what it is.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think we've
already determined

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.600 align:middle line:90%
what they were used for.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But could you be wrong?

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Could I be wrong?

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody could be wrong.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Everybody
could be wrong.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.331 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not being
disrespectful, Mr. Dunn.

00:45:16.331 --> 00:45:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: No, no, no, no, and all
theories should be challenged,

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and other ideas--

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I have received all
kinds of different ideas

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.180 align:middle line:84%
on what the pyramids
were used for

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and how energy was generated.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
people that contact me

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
are very supportive of the
idea, particularly engineers.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.619 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great idea.

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:44.418 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It's--

00:45:44.418 --> 00:45:45.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great theory.

00:45:45.645 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, it's
pretty far out.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:53.642 align:middle line:84%
It was certainly revolutionary
at the time it was published.

00:45:53.642 --> 00:45:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, more
and more people

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to think maybe
that's what it was for,

00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does seem that
today the pyramid as a machine

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is well-embedded
in the narrative

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:13.160 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
Egyptian culture.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an
engineer, John Burke--

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know John or not--

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:23.834 align:middle line:84%
who looked at projects
about the pyramids as well.

00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN BURKE: What
are the biggest

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:29.690 align:middle line:84%
structures that modern
man builds on the planet?

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:84%
The biggest, most awe-inspiring
structures we create

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:90%
are hydroelectric dams.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Why are we willing to invest
such awe-inspiring amounts

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.034 align:middle line:84%
of labor and effort
in constructing those?

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.450 align:middle line:10%
Because we know
we're going to get

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:10%
a very valuable physical return
in the form of electricity.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And by comparison, I wonder if
the ancient megalith builders

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.210 align:middle line:84%
weren't willing to invest such
staggering amounts of resources

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.600 align:middle line:84%
by even smaller populations
because they knew that they

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
could get something very
physical and worthwhile

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:90%
back from it.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> People are fascinated
by Egyptian monuments.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And some report the energy
is palpable at these sites.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
confirm this energy

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.364 align:middle line:90%
through scientific means?

00:47:18.364 --> 00:47:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there, again, we're

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:84%
looking at the possibility that
it was some kind of power plant

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:90%
to be used for some purpose.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it just fueled
all of Egypt, who knows.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, the
questions that he asks

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the same questions
that I asked when I started out

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.510 align:middle line:90%
on this quest.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And it seems-- it's
logical for engineers

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to think along those lines.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you consider
the investment of time

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and the investment of
wealth into building them,

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and to say that they were
just to be used for a tomb,

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:01.900 align:middle line:84%
it just doesn't make
sense, especially when

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.850 align:middle line:84%
you consider that it's
the state of the art that

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:12.550 align:middle line:84%
has still not been equaled
today in terms of construction.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't require
buildings to have micron

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:84%
precision, or even within
as Petrie measured,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.040 align:middle line:84%
back in the 1880s on
the casing stone there,

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.610 align:middle line:84%
where line to line, they're to
within 10,000ths of an inch.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we construct
that pyramid today?

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.920 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.520 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: You know, I think if
there was a concerted effort,

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.020 align:middle line:10%
you know, if we go back to the
'60s, and John Kennedy says,

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.600 align:middle line:10%
we need to go to the moon,
we didn't know, you know,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.400 align:middle line:10%
how to get there.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.820 align:middle line:90%
We had no technology then.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what a great goal.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But he said, we
need to shoot for the moon.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
had, as a goal,

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and we had the whole
civilization, the whole country

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.700 align:middle line:84%
behind us, and to
say we need to learn

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:84%
how to tap into
the earth energies

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to relieve earthquakes
and perhaps also convert

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that energy into
usable power, that

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.620 align:middle line:90%
would be a worthwhile goal.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not just the--

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.510 align:middle line:10%
it's not just the value
of the power of the energy

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:10%
that you get out of the
system, but the reduction

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.980 align:middle line:10%
in destruction, you
know, the wealth

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.130 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to lose
if there is a very, very

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:10%
large earthquake.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could it
have been a beacon

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.215 align:middle line:10%
for some extraterrestrial craft?

00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:56.405 align:middle line:10%


00:49:56.405 --> 00:49:57.530 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: It could have been.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like a homing device?

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: That has been proposed.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
like my work ended

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
southern shaft.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, this is
where-- this is where I am.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.220 align:middle line:90%
This is a few ideas that I have.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:90%
But there have--

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems to be a
popular idea if you really

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:90%
get into fantasizing about--

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: ETs.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.685 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You know,
space-faring nations.

00:50:25.685 --> 00:50:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a
homing beacon or something

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that would triangulate the
position of the craft in space.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.664 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can imagine all kinds
of fantastic scenarios with it.

00:50:43.664 --> 00:50:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Really remarkable work.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: My pleasure.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.566 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there you
have one of the greatest

00:50:50.566 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:84%
mysteries of mankind,
the pyramids of Giza.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.700 align:middle line:90%
What were they used for?

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.410 align:middle line:90%
How were they constructed?

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn believes
they're power plants.
