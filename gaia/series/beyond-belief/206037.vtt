you're a psychic medium.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VINCENT GENNA: That's right.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.219 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have a little
interest in extraterrestrials.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: I hear them and
I can see them slightly,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:90%
when they want me to.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they here for
the betterment of us or them?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We separated
from source,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:84%
which caused us to
forget who we were,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.105 align:middle line:84%
caused us to forget
our abilities

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:90%
and our power, George.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:90%
They didn't forget.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Now what they want
to do, they want

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to help their little
brothers and sisters

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to get to the same place.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I could just see some of
the aliens looking down

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:90%
at us right now.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Stop fighting with each other.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.822 align:middle line:90%
You're a bunch of little brats.

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're right.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Spirituality,
metaphysics, paranormal stuff,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
it's all part of the tools
to be able to understand

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
who we are so that we can do
nothing more, nothing more,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
than create the lives
we want down here

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and achieve our dreams.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.315 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason we are here.

Vincent Genna back
with us, an authentic

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:10%
and gifted psychic medium with
the knowledge and experience

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:10%
of psychotherapy and the
big, charming personality

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:10%
of a showman.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, gosh.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's break into
song right now, George.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know when I'm
doing live events with you

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
around the country, you are one
of the most sought-after person

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
by the audience.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
They just love you.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Thank you.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:10%
It costs me a lot
of money to get them

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:10%
to respond that way, George.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:10%
I pay them all.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I pay them all.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:90%
No, it's-- you know what it is?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:90%
And you know this.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all about energy.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's all about how
you make them feel.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all energy.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:10%
>>GENNA: It's all about, do you
raise their spirits up or do

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:10%
you bring them down, you know?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're not a
psychic vampire by any means.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.312 align:middle line:90%
You give off energy.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:90%
People want to be around you.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
If people learn how to connect
with their greatest source

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
inside, because that's where
it all comes from, right?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We can feed the
entire world with our energy,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
because we're unlimited beings.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you're disconnected,
you want energy still.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:90%
You're taking it.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Then you have to take it.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to take it.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.888 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: You become a thief
in the middle of the night.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, a
vampire, energy vampire.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:90%
But no, I've given--

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You glow.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And people always ask
me if I'm exhausted at the end.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm--

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are high energy.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I--

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.608 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are high energy.

00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well, if you ask my
wife, she says I'm intense.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.203 align:middle line:84%
I always argued that point
until I did a lecture.

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intense is not bad.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.443 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No, it's not.

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I used to correct her.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She could have
said something else.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well, she
does that, too.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Yeah,
she says that too.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I used to always say,
no, I'm not intense.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate about life.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And you should meet my daughter.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
She's passionate, too.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So you put the two of
us together, forget it.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: There's
passion everywhere.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And one-- [LAUGHS] one
time I was doing a lecture

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:10%
and I had to define the word
"passion" in my PowerPoint

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:10%
display.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the dictionary and
it says, "An intense emotion."

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And I went, dang.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm intense.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So she was right.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I hate that.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I picked up
the "Webster Dictionary"

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.092 align:middle line:84%
and looked under "intense,"
and it went, "Vince Genna."

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: There you-- [LAUGHS]

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: There you go.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But you know what
we need more of?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't need downers.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
We need uppers.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We need everybody
to be up and lifted.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.637 align:middle line:84%
And if I can do that,
then dang, I'll do that.

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're
a psychic medium.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.137 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's right.

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have a little
interest in extraterrestrials

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:53.555 align:middle line:90%
and aliens.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, oh.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's so funny about that.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, I was very
interested in sci-fi and aliens

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:90%
and all those movies.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I loved "Cocoon," right?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And "Close Encounters,"
all of them.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I was drawn to that right
away, but not anything more

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.979 align:middle line:84%
than knowing that
there's beings out there.

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's great.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:90%
So I accepted that right away.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden,
as a psychic medium, things

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:90%
started happening.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, one
day I'm in my office,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and I just finished doing
a reading with somebody.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I hear, I hear, "We
want to talk with you."

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh!

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Now, I
hear that inside.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: "We want
to talk with you."

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So just like any other psychic
medium that communicates with--

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I also communicate with
animals, besides dead people.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the other side.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Right, the other side.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Just like anybody else would
do, I turn to my plants

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
in my office.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Is that you?"

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.942 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:58.234 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I didn't know what a--

00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the Venus
flytrap that was sitting

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
there jumped at you, right?

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: That's
right, jumped at me.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And-- [LAUGHS]
the philodendron.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:90%
I was waiting for a response.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like, do I hear plants now?

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then from that point
on, I knew I was in trouble.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm like, who's us?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And they said, "A council.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
We're a council."

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you just hear
them or do you see them?

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I hear them.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can see them slightly,
when they want me to.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And-- but right now, it's
actually all about the voices,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
all about them
giving me guidance,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
all about them really
wanting to give me truth--

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About us.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.735 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: --about us and them.

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.806 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: And why they're--

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
there's been so much
information that's out there.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
a ton of information,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
all sides and interpretations
of what they are.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:90%
What are aliens?

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
You see all the movies.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They're coming out
of people's stomachs

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.575 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
rip your head off.

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've got Pleiadians
sucking brains out

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of people that are living here.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, they
want to correct all of that.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Because as humans,
we become fearful

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of this concept of
aliens and landing.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.455 align:middle line:84%
And the government has to
protect us by hiding all of it,

00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
because that's
all they're doing.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They're shielding us, just
like the religious leaders did.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to share the
mystical books of knowledge

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:84%
with us, because they didn't
think we can handle it.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like we've got
to hide the UFO stuff.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can
handle the truth.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.855 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: [EXHALES]

00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
show you a clip.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: OK.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the late
Sergeant Clifford Stone.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, OK.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:90%
one of our Gaia programs.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he has had a lifelong
contact with a being

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Corona.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Not the beer.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Not the beer.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But Corona.

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: OK.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk more
about Corona--

00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:51.825 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>> --because this is
really a fascinating story.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Sarge, what did you
learn about them?

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:10%
Their species, their culture.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Did they teach you anything?

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, it's
interesting that you ask.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.695 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I say
that, when they chose me,

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:10%
and they were going to
follow me throughout my life,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:10%
and I got to see Corona
as he really looked,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and no longer seeing
him as a child,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:10%
I can remember crying and
begging my mom and dad

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:10%
to take me to the doctor,
because the doctor could

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:10%
make the monsters go away.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:10%
At the tender age of seven,
I had to make a decision.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Do I go ahead and fight what's
happening to me, at which time

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose my mind?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be normal.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:10%
Or do I go ahead and accept
the fate that's been dealt me

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:10%
and learn from it?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:10%
I chose the latter.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:10%
What did I learn?

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I learned there are species
that are visiting us.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not cartoon characters
like we most of the time think.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:10%
We see them as will-o'-the-wisp
that comes out of the night

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:10%
to scare us, the creature
hiding under our beds,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:10%
the creature in the closet.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:10%
They are so much like us.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:10%
They have families.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:10%
They have friends.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:10%
They have likes.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%
They have dislikes.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
They really like to share
about their families.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think feel that
I was every abducted.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:10%
But I can tell you
right now that I

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:10%
have seen the stars in
such great magnitude,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:10%
great brilliance, that there's
no place on the planet Earth

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:10%
that you could ever
see the stars the way

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.294 align:middle line:10%
I saw them at that time.

00:08:41.294 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Clifford Stone.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:43.810 align:middle line:90%
He just passed away, Vince.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, that's amazing.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.617 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But an amazing person.

00:08:45.617 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
And I can 100% validate that.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They have been here
for the longest time.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And you heard what
he said, that he

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
had to make a decision
whether to go with it--

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:57.325 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: --or hide it.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we've done,
but only in contemporary times.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials have
been on this planet

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of our existence.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's how we advanced
the way we did.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
People have accepted them
in all different cultures.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:90%
You go over to Peru.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
We're the aliens over there,
because the other ones,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
they're there all the
time, and they are family.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They're our big
brothers and sisters.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what everybody
has to understand.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
When we were
created, all souls--

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
souls.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Not this body.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
All souls were created
by a higher being.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.648 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And then
in order to learn

00:09:35.648 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
who we were, we couldn't hang
out together with dad or mom,

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
that higher source or spirit.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We had to go and
experience ourselves,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:90%
just like our children do today.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They go out from
the home and they

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.323 align:middle line:84%
go create a life for themselves,
to discover who they are.

00:09:52.323 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes
they come back.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.482 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, yeah, sometimes.

00:09:55.482 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And they want to stay
there sometimes, too.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, that wasn't
our problem, but I

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%
know a lot of people that was.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:10%
So we all went to different
places and environments.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
And then you grow.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They grew faster than we did
because of some of the choices

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
they made versus some
of the choices we made.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We separated from
source, which caused

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.155 align:middle line:84%
us to forget who we were, caused
us to forget our abilities

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and our power, George.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't forget,
and they used it.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So that helped them to evolve
even higher and quicker.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Now what they want
to do, they want

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to help their little
brothers and sisters

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:90%
to get to the same place.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for them, you see
this body and us sitting here?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We wouldn't
be like this.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
helped to create this body.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:10%
And why they keep coming back
now and abducting people,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:10%
they're only
abducting because we

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:10%
are creating diseases
and illnesses faster

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:10%
than our ability to cure them.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Obviously.

00:10:58.067 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: They-- yeah,
right, with what

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.942 align:middle line:90%
we've been dealing with, right?

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: They came and helped
splice our genes and change

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.507 align:middle line:90%
our genetics' lay out--

00:11:08.507 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To help us.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --in order to
help us fight those.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:90%
They can't keep up with it now.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you
see more of them.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.792 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
government is going

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to hide because they don't
think we can deal with it,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.167 align:middle line:90%
finally, they're coming out.

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't
hide it anymore,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and we need to establish
a relationship with them.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
they were stopped

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.877 align:middle line:84%
from coming to our
planet in the beginning--

00:11:33.877 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who stopped them?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: The council.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:90%
There is--

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, the Federation.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: The Federation.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Absolu-- "Star
Trek" had it right,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
if we only just
went along with it.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder who told Gene
Roddenberry what was going on.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: He was inspired by
what he already knew was true.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's the whole point.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't imagine anything
that's not true already.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.327 align:middle line:84%
It's your interpretation
of it that can change.

00:11:56.327 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: So what happened
was they came to our planet,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:90%
helped us in the beginning.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say you had
a younger brother or sister,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.107 align:middle line:84%
and you were going
to school together.

00:12:06.107 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting
home in the kitchen

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing your
homework together.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And your little sister
there is on question number

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:90%
three of math.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.607 align:middle line:84%
And you go, (WHISPERING)
the answer is 7.

00:12:14.607 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:90%
(ALOUD) And you keep doing that.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
Mom interferes.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And she goes,
honey, honey, honey.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
George, let her do
her homework herself.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:90%
She's got to learn by herself.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's got
to make her mistakes.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And learn--
that's right.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Make the mistakes you did.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:90%
So they stopped us.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
That stopped the aliens
from coming to help us.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.035 align:middle line:84%
But once Mom left the
room, what did you do?

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:39.855 align:middle line:84%
(WHISPERING) The
answer to 10 is 5.

00:12:39.855 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: You snuck.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%
They had to sneak here now.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was, we got
so un-used to being with them

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that now we feared
the sightings.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it became so unusual
rather than usual, George.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
intergalactic council

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Yes.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they here for
the betterment of us or them?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: That's
a great question.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:90%
They're already better.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
us to their level.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing
about us-- and oh.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Remember "The Day the
Earth Stood Still"?

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love it.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Michael Rennie?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Yes.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
That movie was fabulous!

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.277 align:middle line:84%
But the interpretation was,
he came down to warn us.

00:13:25.277 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To help us.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Because he
said, Earth, you're

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
starting to develop
nuclear arms.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We wouldn't accept it.

00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's right.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You're going to hurt
the rest of the planets,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to stop
you from doing that.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So you either learn or we're
going to get rid of you.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's actually
not possible.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We cannot interfere
in another universe,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
because the other universes
aren't anywhere near

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
our dimension.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:90%
There are parallel universes.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
You hear-- watch
the History Channel.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You hear all about the
parallel universes.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Even your show, you've
had people come on--

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.892 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: --and talk about that.

00:13:59.892 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything is
a parallel universe,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
because all dimensions exist
parallel to each other.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The past, the
present, the future,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
where the deceased go, where we
go after we leave our bodies,

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:90%
all the other universes.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They're in different dimensions
that on top of each other,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
all together, right here.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein, Albert
Einstein, was the one

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
who said, the only way that
an alien culture could come

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and visit us into this universe,
or we escape and go visit them,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is if you develop high
spiritual concepts.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And it takes that concept
in order to dematerialize.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:90%
That's how they're getting here.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're spot on.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
A channeler, Darryl
Anka, describes

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
how he came in contact
with his beings.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, wow.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:10%
>> The feeling of connecting
with Bashar telepathically is

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.540 align:middle line:10%
kind of like, I can describe
it like it's a vibrational

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:10%
resonance that is a particular
frequency that I recognize

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:10%
as not my own.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:10%
Or at least, a much
bigger part of me.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:10%
And I sort of liken it to
the idea of two tuning forks.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
When you start one vibrating,
if they're keyed to each other,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
then the other one starts
vibrating in harmony.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
start matching frequency

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and vibrating together,
that's kind of what it's like.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:10%
So the channeling class,
as I understood it,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:10%
ultimately was training you to
shift your brainwave frequency

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:10%
to a point where you
go into a state called

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:10%
gamma, which is about 40, 45,
or 40 to 100 cycles per second.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:10%
But I stay in the range of about
40 to 45 when I'm channeling.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And then Bashar
makes an adjustment

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
in his brainwave frequency.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in
the middle, we lock.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:90%
[CLANG]

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And as we vibrate
together, what you get

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is a translation of his
thoughts into the language

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
that I'm programmed with.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:10%
So the idea of channeling is
not possession or anything

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:10%
It is a synchronization
of frequencies

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:10%
that allow you to have the
same thoughts at the same time

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:10%
as whoever you are vibrating
on the same wavelength with.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
someone like a spirit guide

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
or an alien guide
that helps you?

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well, not
with any connection.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:90%
But I do.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I actually channel
Joseph from Canaan.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Joseph?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: "Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat" Joseph?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.303 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:30.303 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: He is the dude
who introduced himself

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to me to get me to become a
psychic medium to start with.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where it all
began is with him.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And he came into me.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.603 align:middle line:90%
And he says it really--

00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You channel--

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --well scientifically
and what's happening.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
For me, I wasn't aware
of any of that stuff.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And so the voice comes in.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And all I kept hearing is,
"You have to honor the voice.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Honor the inner
voice that you hear."

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And I channeled that.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't help connect.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Now that I'm open and I've
spent over 37 years studying

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:10%
this and practicing
it and perfecting it--

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:10%
I even go to school for it.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
I go over to England to
Arthur Findlay College

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.984 align:middle line:90%
of Psychic Sciences, just to--

00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
the best schools.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.543 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Absolutely, in
order to perfect my skills.

00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, they want to know,
why am I coming over there?

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.043 align:middle line:90%
You already know how to do this.

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.678 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I'm doing my
continuing education credits.

00:17:21.678 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing psychotherapy--

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm tuning
myself up, right?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's it.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm tuning myself.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, you use tuning
forks in there, right?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Tuning myself up.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is, and it's always

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.587 align:middle line:84%
when I'm feeling at
my best and centered,

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
which is what I do when I'm
doing my work to start with.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And then all
of a sudden, the voice.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.595 align:middle line:84%
You just start
hearing the voice.

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
"We want to talk with you,"
where information just comes.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:90%
It just begins to come.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm always
asked-- it's unbelievable

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that humans still want to
believe that everything

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
influences us, rather than we
influence everything, including

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:90%
the planets.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Astrology, we interpret it
as the planet alignment.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
If Mercury is retrograding, it's
absolutely going to affect us.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.807 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones to
set it up that way.

00:18:14.807 --> 00:18:15.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did that.

00:18:15.682 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: We're the ones--

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did it.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: We did it.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
We align or disalign
the planets.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
We sent the meteor here,
and our alien friends--

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --to get rid of the
life that was on the planet,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
all the dinosaurs--

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.118 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To start over.

00:18:32.118 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --so that
we could exist.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
modern man began.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:10%
When we allow a
planet to affect us--

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:10%
like when Mercury
is retrograding,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:10%
the best things
happen in my life.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.328 align:middle line:84%
I love-- when I hear Mercury
is retrograding, I can't wait.

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're all excited.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: All excited.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:90%
But I also did the work, George.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so many people do to
have it affect us that way.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:90%
So when it comes to--

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:90%
they explain black holes.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I never knew this about
what a black hole is.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.516 align:middle line:84%
But what a black
hole actually is

00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is a no-longer needed universe.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who says that?

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: The council.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, the council.

00:19:15.182 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: When we are done
coming to the Earth--

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.132 align:middle line:90%
the Earth is here for us.

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope they
don't do this to us.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: They're not doing it.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
When we no longer
need the Earth,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
the Earth will no
longer exist, George.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.085 align:middle line:84%
That is what they
told us that happens.

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Then we don't have
to incarnate--

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
any intervention.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No intervention.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It goes away by itself.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we're, at this point,
keeping the Earth alive.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't we keep the trees alive?

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Every time we exhale--

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.188 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --we're
feeding the trees.

00:19:47.188 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They're feeding us,
we're feeding them.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But since we are the
greater energy, which

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is the way we were created,
and that's what is meant by we

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:90%
have dominion.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- the first
chapter in the Bible

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:90%
is about us being created.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then once we were
down, you will always

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.208 align:middle line:84%
have dominion over
everything on the planet.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's true.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.792 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Including the physical
body, because we're energies.

00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
Federation considered God?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Whoa, whoa.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever asked me
that question before.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:90%
God created also the Federation.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: The source created all
the souls, just like angels,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:90%
just like--

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:90%
just, they have different roles.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And the Federation is a soul.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
not even physical.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:90%
They're just spirits.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
They're souls from
each universe, angels.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of helping
to guide everything,

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:90%
just like you would see.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
But not of the negative stuff.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There is actually a council
of all the brilliant--

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci,
Albert Einstein, Tesla.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
They're all getting
together on the other side,

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
as brains and wisdom, and trying
to feed us information down

00:20:59.020 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Einstein, Edison.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Edison.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: All of them.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.542 align:middle line:84%
They did it while they
were alive and together.

00:21:05.542 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
They got together
and brainstormed.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do governments
know about the Federation?

00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, why do
they keep it secret?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: The government
knows everything.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It decides what it
wants to release to us.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons,
the major reason,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
why it has hidden
all this alien stuff

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
is because of war
with the worlds.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see if you agree
with this, from "Deep Space."

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Go ahead.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:10%
>> When we start
getting into the upper,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:10%
highest level echelon of the
cover-up of the UFO phenomenon,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:10%
I still feel that I
need to be careful,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:10%
and researchers
need to be careful.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Who's the actual person
at the top of it?

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it David Rockefeller?

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it some member of
the Rothschild family?

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.465 align:middle line:84%
Is it some member that
we don't know about

00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
within the deep black
budget community?

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the aliens themselves,
in one form or another?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:10%
I guess we can ask
ourselves, what

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:10%
is the likelihood that the
non-human intelligences that

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:10%
are behind the UFO
phenomenon are managing

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.483 align:middle line:10%
the cover-up to some extent?

00:22:08.483 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:10%
I think we could
say a few things.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
One, we can say they do not have
an interest in being out there

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and being publicly acknowledged.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:90%
They do operate by stealth.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they've always
operated by stealth.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:10%
So they have an interest in
maintaining a cover of secrecy.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end,
if I were tasked

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
with doing counterintelligence
on the cover-up,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I would have to consider the
likelihood that they themselves

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
have some role to
play in the secrecy.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
There is a story about a
famous murdered remote viewer

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Pat
Price back in the 1970s.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Pat Price was possibly
the best remote viewer

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:90%
the United States ever had.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
He was an off-the-charts
remote viewer.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:90%
He was that good.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
He had one of the
rare abilities to read

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:90%
alphanumeric information.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:10%
That is, in other words, he
could read documents and file

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:10%
cabinets and things like this.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
He was extremely,
extremely proficient.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, he did--
on his own, he said,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:84%
some remote viewing work on
where alien bases were here

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:10%
He strolled into the
office in the mid '70s

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:10%
of Hal Puthoff, who was running
the program, and said, oh, yes.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I thought I
would, just on my spare time,

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
look to see where
the alien bases were.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:90%
He said this.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And he identified several.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They were all basically
in mountain areas.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:90%
One was in the Pyrenees.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:90%
One was in Mount Hayes, Alaska.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:10%
And he said, regarding that
base, the Mount Hayes, Alaska,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:10%
base, he said, that has
political protection

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:10%
in the United States government.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, they have their
people in the US government

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
who are making sure that no
one pries in on that base.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:10%
That particular base, the
way Pat Price described it,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:10%
was somewhat similar
to how you might

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:10%
look at the base in
the Hollywood movie,

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:10%
"Men in Black."

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:10%
You know, the huge Alien Depot
where all the different races

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.015 align:middle line:10%
go, and humans as well.

00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Not qui-- I don't
think he described it

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
with quite the humor that
you get in the movie.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But in other words,
a big transit point.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what Pat Price
said to Puthoff about that base

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
is when he was
remote viewing it,

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:90%
they began remote viewing him.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And he pulled away out of fear.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's true.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And that would seem to
indicate to me that there

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is some level of
collaboration and/or control

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.693 align:middle line:84%
that is being exercised by
them within our society.

00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Similar to your theory
about "War of the Worlds."

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I know, right?

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:84%
In actuality, George,
that's partially true.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- they are not
in total alignment with us

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
yet because of the
lack of acceptance.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
If their purpose is
to come here to help,

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
they want to make sure that
even our leaders accept that,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're the ones that
are introducing it to us.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
They allow us to learn a
certain amount of information

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:84%
at certain times,
when they decide

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:90%
we're ready to handle it.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So if there's no
major interference,

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's not that the aliens
don't want to be here.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But like I said
earlier, their job

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
isn't to correct
everything here.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:90%
It's our job to do it.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So they want to feed us a
little information at a time,

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.880 align:middle line:84%
but they want us to stop
being afraid of them.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The major reason the
council came to me

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
is because they knew I was
going to be a personality that

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:90%
was going to be out there.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
People were going to be
talking to me, to share, just

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
like this, what we're
doing right now--

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.913 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
microphone for them.

00:25:29.913 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Exactly.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
To be able to set it straight
as to why they're here.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They will help as
much as they can,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:84%
but we have to stop
fearing them, and knowing

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that
there's more to life.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They are-- why
are we so hung up?

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
All these theories, all
of these hidden movies,

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and we have to go
research to even watch

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:90%
an episode like that, right?

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: In order to find it.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Why are we still hung up
on these things of aliens

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials and--

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:84%
this has been going
on for ages now.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, and it's so hidden.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: It is.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.185 align:middle line:90%
And it shouldn't be hidden.

00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:90%
And that is the human condition.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't even
know who we are--

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they trying
to save us from something?

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: They're saving
us from ourselves.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality, metaphysics,
paranormal stuff,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
it's all part of the tools
to be able to understand

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
who we are so that we can do
nothing more, nothing more,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
than create the lives
we want down here

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and achieve our dreams.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason we are here.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there good
aliens and bad, Vince?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is love and
tough love, George.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.267 align:middle line:84%
So what people may interpret,
think of the parent.

00:26:49.267 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a parent is.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Exactly.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Think of the parent that, OK.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The kids have-- you're acting
up a little bit too much, so

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.385 align:middle line:90%
Unless you take responsibility--

00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's tough love.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --we are
going to-- you're

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:90%
going to either have to leave.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.867 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be
supporting you any more,

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:90%
but we love you very much.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
All right, so you've got--

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I could just see some of
the aliens looking down

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.453 align:middle line:90%
at us right now.

00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking at
us going, what are you,

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:90%
all meshuganah down there?

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
This is like, come on.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Get your act together.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to-- stop
fighting with each other.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:90%
You're a bunch of little brats.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're right.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: See that.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:90%
They are 100%--

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are right.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.242 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And then
there's the other brother

00:27:27.242 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:90%
who goes, oh, give him a break.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.325 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be fine.

00:27:31.325 --> 00:27:32.125 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
You were just as bad when you
were a little kid, weren't you?

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
That's how they're acting,
but they're no more than that.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, there
is no gray society

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of aliens who decided
to make a home down

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:84%
in the bottom of the ocean
and make love to an alligator

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.438 align:middle line:90%
and become a new reptilian race.

00:27:56.438 --> 00:27:57.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:27:57.355 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Why on
Earth would a higher

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
evolved being and race want
to procreate with lizards

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth?

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A Dolphin, maybe.

00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, maybe.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Or a killer whale.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.583 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't mind that, so I
can swim a little bit better,

00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:15.610 align:middle line:90%
that's for sure, right?

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
right about a killer--

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.203 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We can get around
a lot better than that.

00:28:18.203 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's some crazy attitude,
and it's because of fear.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
We fear everything.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And through fear, we're
interpreting all of this.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they seed us?

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: They spliced us.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.123 align:middle line:90%
So in other words--

00:28:36.123 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With what was here.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: With what-- OK.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
This was stated in the
story of Cain and Abel.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.725 align:middle line:90%
That's the first--

00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GENNA: --piece
of information that

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:10%
lets us know we were
a different race.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The Bible, as it is now, is not
of the beginning of humankind.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning of
this mankind humankind.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: The modern man.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The new one.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: That's
right, the new one.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Adam was the first son of
man, not the son of God.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so during Cain
and Abel-- remember,

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.255 align:middle line:90%
after Cain kills Abel--

00:29:15.255 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His brother.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Right, his brother.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And God casts him out
of the Garden of Eden.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
God says to him, you will
not be able to procreate

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:90%
with those of your race.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:10%
You can only procreate
with those of the Earth.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the funny thing.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Go do a DNA test now.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.195 align:middle line:84%
I did my DNA test,
and it's hysterical.

00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize what
was going to come back.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, really.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.718 align:middle line:84%
My family's going
to love this one.

00:29:43.718 --> 00:29:44.518 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:44.518 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They will let you know if you
have any modern man in you

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:90%
or Neanderthal.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
They have the two--

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --separated, because
they're two different DNA

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:90%
strands.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.745 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And if you ever met in
my father's side of the family,

00:30:02.745 --> 00:30:05.755 align:middle line:84%
you'd understand why I do
have some Neanderthal in me.

00:30:05.755 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: These Italians, when
we got together, they threw

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:90%
meatballs at each other, OK?

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Forget about it.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Forget about it!

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It was that kind of family.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.660 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:84%
What they did is
because they knew

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that it would take
too long for us

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to evolve from the Neanderthal
to who we are today.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're not
thousands and thousands

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years
old, as we think we are.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:84%
They came and they spliced
a higher level of DNA.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.385 align:middle line:90%
Gregg Braden.

00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:36.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super guy.

00:30:36.185 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: When you read his
books, in "Fractured Times,"

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:90%
he talks about that.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
something changed.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.540 align:middle line:10%
There was a splicing
of a new DNA strand

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:10%
to now make modern man
that appeared on the Earth

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:10%
11,000 years ago spontaneously.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that kind of
reminds me of the guest

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
on "Open Minds," Tom
Moore, who talked

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
about his telepathic
communication with a being

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:84%
from the Sirius B star
system about humans.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Theo and Anture and everyone
says that humans were called

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:90%
the explorer race.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We all volunteered for this in
order to fast track our souls

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and raising vibrational levels.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:84%
That's all the soul's
goals is raising

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:90%
your vibrational levels.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's been on a
plateau for millions of years.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
They just hit a plateau and
they couldn't go any higher.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the creator
said that he wanted

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to have this, where we would
be veiled, not knowing anything

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
about it, so that we would be
able to reinvent the wheel.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we'd be
doing all these things that

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
had been created before by
all these other societies who

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.895 align:middle line:90%
think there's no--

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:90%
they can't do it any better.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But the creator feels that
they are going to do it better,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to
do it and create things

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in different ways that have
never been created before,

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.257 align:middle line:90%
because we can't go back.

00:32:11.257 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, let's see.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That was 10 lives ago when
I handled that problem.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, can't do that.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have to solve
the problem anew,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we'll solve
it in a better way

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.110 align:middle line:90%
than has ever been done before.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we were given
this negativity.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And no other society,
no other universe

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:84%
has ever been able
to handle negativity.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
billions of universes,

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's
billions of creators.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But no one's been able
to handle negativity.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:10%
And so the creator
felt that we would

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:10%
be able to handle
the negativity,

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:10%
and we've handled it.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened in like 1987,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, with
the harmonic convergence,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
where we reached the
level where we will never

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:90%
destroy ourselves.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vince, do
you agree with him?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, what I--

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somewhat?

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, somewhat.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The part that I don't agree
with is the negativity part.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The creator didn't
give us negativity.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:90%
We created negativity.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We did
that to ourselves.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Right.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
We found-- but here
is a theory that I

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:22.700 align:middle line:84%
have been told that a lot of
people would not like to hear,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that the creator,
God itself, evolved.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It evolved.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.525 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't always perfect.

00:33:28.525 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There will be some
who will not like that.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: There's a lot
who would not like that.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
interesting concept.

00:33:32.955 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: But if you look
at it and accept it,

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
then we have more of a
chance of understanding.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
We were created in its image,
so why can we be so imperfect,

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:90%
but it was never imperfect?

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The story of Noah and the Ark,
all the stories in the Bible

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:84%
are metaphysical
messages for us.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
historical accounts.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.755 align:middle line:84%
But they're all pretty
accurate, right?

00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: They are very accurate.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, Noah-- the story of Noah
had nothing to do with us.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:90%
The whole story was about God.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:90%
God was angry.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:84%
God was angry with
us because of the way

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:84%
we were acting and
treating each other,

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
so he decided to wipe us all
out, except Noah's family.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And start all over.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Start all over.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.304 align:middle line:84%
Noah was the best out
of the entire bunch.

00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Eh, menza, menza.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.442 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: But he had
to pick somebody.

00:34:19.442 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll send all
my animals and him,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and we'll start all over again.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:10%
But what did God say at the end?

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
When they landed,
the water subsided.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:90%
What did he do, George?

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:10%
He put out a rainbow and
he said, "That rainbow

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:10%
is my promise to you.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I will never do this again."

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:90%
He saw what he did.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.424 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: And he didn't like it.

00:34:42.424 --> 00:34:43.224 align:middle line:90%
In the Bible--

00:34:43.224 --> 00:34:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It scared God.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --in the
beginning, when he first

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:84%
created the world, he said,
or it said, he/she, it said,

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:90%
"It saw it was good."

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.445 align:middle line:84%
But when he destroyed it, it
saw that that was not good.

00:34:58.445 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's not good.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: So it evolved.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It went to a higher level.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we, having the capacity
of both sides, because that's

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
what we were given, we wanted
to know everything that we could

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
at one time, which is the whole
story of the Garden of Eden.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And we opened up a
can of worms, Pandora's box.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:23.893 align:middle line:84%
So we learned about pride
and we learned about sorrow

00:35:23.893 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and we learned about anger
and we learned about rage

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and we learned about
disappointment.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And we were like, oh, my gosh.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:90%
All of that at one time.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Without the ability to
being able to handle it,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.830 align:middle line:90%
like little kids.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what made us
lose the Garden of Eden.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.345 align:middle line:84%
Once we opened that box,
the source turned around

00:35:40.345 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and spirit turns
around and said, look.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know
all of that right now.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
controls the planet?

00:35:45.735 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Us or the Federation?

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Us.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:90%
We're on the planet.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.390 align:middle line:90%
As long as we're here--

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our decision.

00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Us.

00:35:51.595 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the whole reason why
it's trying to help us

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:90%
is giving us more chance.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
doing right now,

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not just
destroying ourselves.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
We're hurting this planet.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
We just came out of a year
that had one of the most

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:90%
number of storms in history.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: OK, and hurricanes.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that our fault?

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Yes, because
we also came out

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of a time period of
anger, resentment,

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.115 align:middle line:84%
fighting each other, killings
all over the place, wars,

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:20.915 align:middle line:90%
battles.

00:36:20.915 --> 00:36:22.873 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what will
it take for us, Vince,

00:36:22.873 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
to learn that we can't
continue down that path?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: It's a matter of
reconnecting with ourselves

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:90%
It always starts with ourselves.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
What we do on the inside will
extend out into our society

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.336 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know how to
get along with ourselves.

00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:41.294 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:36:41.294 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We get guidance
every single day.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have never
gotten along with ourselves.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:90%
We fight ourselves.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:90%
We criticize ourselves.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.983 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what self-love is.

00:36:49.983 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
self-appreciation is.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were we made this way?

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:84%
We were made to be
perfect to start with.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But because, the
moment we disconnected

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and we forgot that
we were part--

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.720 align:middle line:84%
actually, we forgot
that we are God.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.175 align:middle line:90%
The way God created us--

00:37:10.175 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is in his image.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --is in his image
by dividing himself into us.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
makes us the same.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes us
individual God beings,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.393 align:middle line:84%
even though it exists and
it's a power unto itself.

00:37:23.393 --> 00:37:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
everybody-- they're

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:84%
going to say, oh, well, look at
the grandiose attitude he has.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, people
who think they're

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
gods, like the Egyptian
pharaohs, did they--

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: He knew.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:90%
They knew.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:90%
They knew the concept.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:90%
We are God.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.795 align:middle line:84%
But then they forgot
that everybody is,

00:37:41.795 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and they just went,
well, it's just me,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.212 align:middle line:84%
not you, because I
guess I have more money.

00:37:45.212 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:84%
That makes me a
better God than you.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
That not what's true.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.650 align:middle line:90%
We're all that God.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But the moment we
forgot that, we just

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.050 align:middle line:90%
relied on our human sides.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where
does this take us?

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: It's in our hands.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Completely, 100%.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we win?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Oh, that's a
great question that even I,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.300 align:middle line:90%
as a psychic--

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.425 align:middle line:84%
and if there's any other
psychic on the planet that

00:38:09.425 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
can answer that question with
any definite and assurity,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.918 align:middle line:90%
they're kidding everybody.

00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not a psychic.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.085 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: They're not.

00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:10%
Because the true answer
that I get all the time,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:10%
and I get it from
spirit as well, is it's

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:10%
completely in your hands.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can make
this all get better.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
always in our hands.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: It was
always in our hands.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.672 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to tell
you something, George.

00:38:30.672 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I am not-- I've got
a lot of colleagues

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
in my realm, the spiritual realm
and the metaphysical realm,

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of
beliefs that oh, yes.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- the opportunities
are fabulous now.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful now.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:90%
We're advancing.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:90%
We are evolving.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lecture this
year about ascending

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth dimension.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.565 align:middle line:84%
We can't even get along
in the third dimension,

00:38:52.565 --> 00:38:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and now we want to become
singers and to sing "Aquarius."

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we're going
to jump to the fifth?

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: No, we're not
going to get there.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Not the way it's going.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.125 align:middle line:84%
We actually have more evidence
that nothing has changed

00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're going in the
opposite direction.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Having knowledge, the knowledge
is becoming more apparent.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And through shows like yours
and books and lectures,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:84%
there's wonderful
wisdom out there

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
about higher consciousness,
scientifically

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:90%
admitting all of this stuff.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge alone does
not make wisdom.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:84%
What turns knowledge into
wisdom is application.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to apply all
of this knowledge.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we will, one day.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We're going to, and
we have that opportunity.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.030 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're still here.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:10%
We're not wiped out.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.820 align:middle line:10%
We're not wiping ourselves out.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.180 align:middle line:10%
If your soul and my soul thought
that there was no chance,

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.133 align:middle line:10%
we would have left.

00:39:47.133 --> 00:39:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Vince, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.230 align:middle line:10%
It's always a pleasure.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.438 align:middle line:10%
>>GENNA: Oh, my gosh, George.

00:39:51.438 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having me here and
tolerating all of this energy

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:10%
I keep throwing at you, and
this passion and intensity,

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:10%
like my wife says.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the
kind of psychic medium

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.920 align:middle line:90%
you'll want to listen to.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot out there, but
there's only one Vincent Genna.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
