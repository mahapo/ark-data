00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And another special guest for
you, Jack Cary, is with us.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Jack is a cryptozoologist.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
He is in charge, of course,
of the Paranormal Intelligence

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Agency, which is an organization
that looks for these very

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:90%
strange creatures.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Jack, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK CARY: Thank you, George.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not that you wake
up in the morning and say,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
"I'm gonna be a
cryptozoologist!"

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: No, no, not
specifically cryptozoology,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:10%
but you become enamored by some
of these paranormal mysteries.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: And that leads you into
investigating some of them.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was investigating a
number of different paranormal

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon when I came into
contact with my late partner,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:84%
JC Johnson, who was the most
renowned cryptozoologist

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:90%
in the world at that time.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And he took me under his
wing, became my mentor.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great wing to be under.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He was my mentor,
and I was his student

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in all things having to
do with cryptozoology.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted my
expertise on things

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that were unrelated
to cryptozoology.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So together, we were
able to undertake

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
a number of investigations
that kind of straddled

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:90%
the line at times.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we grew
to love each other

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
like brothers and family.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was a great
experience for me.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Jack, we're
gonna begin this program

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
on a somewhat somber
note, because JC

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is no longer with
us, passing away

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 58 of
really a tragedy,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:90%
a pneumonia that got to him.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
That's gotta be pretty
difficult for you.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: It was a great
shock to not only me

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:10%
but to the rest of the members
of Crypto Four Corners, which

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:10%
is the foundation, the
group that he founded,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:10%
that studies animals that
really shouldn't exist but do.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a shock
to his family.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a grave shock to
the hundreds of thousands

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
of people that followed JC's
work all around the world

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and visited the Crypto Four
Corners YouTube channel

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and made it such
a hit that it was.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're still trying to
get over the loss of him.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
What was it that made JC
so special in the field

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
of cryptozoology?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know, JC not only
wasn't interested in money

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
or fame, he was
simply interested

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
in discovering and presenting
the truth to the public.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that came across in
everything that he did.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.808 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a rarity too.

00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is, it is.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
He was the kind of man that
would give you the shirt right

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
off of his back.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him do it with
more than one stranger.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was just this
sort of magic about JC,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
where he would attract
this phenomenon.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
times where we

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
were out in the field
together and off

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.585 align:middle line:84%
the beaten path in
such a way that it

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
would take you a week to walk
out of some of these areas.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was some sort
of magnetism about him.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
He attracted these
creatures to him.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was a gift.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Added to that, that we
worked with Navajo trackers

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
for so long in
northern New Mexico

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that we usually
had them with us,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and they were always
teaching us how

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to become better trackers
of some of these animals.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JC was fascinated
by the Dogman Case.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.557 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes.

00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JC Jackson As you
can see behind us,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
swampy, the swampy area,
Jack found this greenbelt

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the
way to the mountains

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much connects
with the neighborhood.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.854 align:middle line:90%
Would you say a mile and a half?

00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, approximately
a mile and a half.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.436 align:middle line:84%
>>JC Jackson A mile
and a half, and it's

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
all greenbelt going
into this Denver suburb.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is pretty fascinating.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm more along the
lines of thinking

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
we might have something in
the area of a Dogman outside

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
of my feelings, that
it was a one time

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
incident with a werewolf, a
were-creature, a skinwalker,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:90%
what have you.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, there he was.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.809 align:middle line:90%
That's the man.

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: The man and the legend.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was the best
at what he did,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
which is collecting
the information that

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
was factual about these cases,
and then presenting it in a way

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%
that the public was OK with.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know,
and that's really

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
what we're about, is
trying to get the public

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to recognize and acknowledge
the reality of some

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of these different
phenomenon, including

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
these creatures that
JC would often call

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:90%
the remnants of the Nephilim.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.706 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, he held
the belief that these

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
were talked about in the
Bible, when all of creation

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:84%
became corrupt through the
genetic manipulation of life

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.102 align:middle line:84%
forms here on the planet
from the fallen angels,

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and that some of these
creatures were still out there

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.664 align:middle line:90%
roaming around, like Dogman.

00:05:20.664 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You might be right.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Dogman.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
He also mentioned skinwalkers,
but what are Dogmen?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, you know,
JC had the belief that--

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and he had a really
good reason to do so,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
because skinwalkers
and werecreatures are

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
a norm on the Navajo
Indian reservations

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:84%
where we worked a
lot, and that he

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:90%
had even family connections to.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And he came across
a number of cases

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
where someone had seen a
skinwalker, a werewolf, if you

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
will, and followed
human footprints

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.997 align:middle line:90%
with his native trackers.

00:05:55.997 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human footprints.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Human footprints until
those footprints literally

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.132 align:middle line:84%
turned into what
appeared to be canine.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
shift right into that.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They just shift
from one step to the next.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't miss
a beat in the steps, do you?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.615 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's right.

00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And these are out
in areas where,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
if you were gonna try
to perpetrate a hoax,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of somebody ever
really coming across them--

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: For you to
somehow outsmart them--

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spend that
kind of time to do that.

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, it's
just impossible.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he had the belief
that werecreatures

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
existed along with
what we believe

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
are a species of upright walking
and running canine creatures,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and that these Dogmen
were what they were full

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
time, 24 hours a day.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these creatures
intelligent to the point

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
where they acted more
human than animal?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Very, very much so, and
very reminiscent of Sasquatch.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
fascinating about them,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a
pattern coexisting

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:90%
in Sasquatch and Dogman.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You have existing Native
American oral history

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
going back hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:90%
describing the creature.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
You have a nonstop body of
credible witnesses coming

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
forward, telling
you what they saw.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
You have physical evidence being
left in the form of footprints

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
and DNA.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Melba Ketchum actually
was able to collect

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Dogman DNA from her own
personal encounter, which

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:90%
she's spoken of now publicly.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And you have what appears to be
a pattern of people seeing them

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
in very specific places,
and that pattern with Dogman

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.057 align:middle line:90%
is water, cornfields.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cornfields?

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, and Native
American burial mounds.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Any time you look up a very
credible Dogman sighting,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
those three things were
present, and those three things

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
were present in the
Liquid Lichen Case, which

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:90%
you guys just showed a clip of.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody reported of
anything serious in terms

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
of Dogmen attacking them
or anything like that?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There have been
a number of people,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
for instance a jogger in
Canada that was wounded

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:90%
by one of these creatures.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
They've been chased
numerous times.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many witnesses who

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.004 align:middle line:90%
have fired firearms at them.

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they hit them?

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.545 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Claimed
to have hit them,

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and also claimed it seemed to
have no effect on the creature.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I, in my own research
investigating

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
the Dogmen sightings
came across the fact

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that in South and Central
Oklahoma, for instance,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
dating around the
early 1900s, in

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
these little, old, overgrown,
and largely abandoned

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
cemeteries all through
Southern Oklahoma,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
you find headstones that read
"murdered by human wolves."

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now, what would it take
for a people in a very small

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.476 align:middle line:84%

normally 30, 40 people--

00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:45.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human wolves.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: And I believe you
guys have a still of one

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:10%
of those headstones
I supplied to you.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we've
got a lot of stills

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.336 align:middle line:90%
that I wanna take a look at.

00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look as we continue
our discussion here, Jack.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%
How tall are the creatures?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Kind of describe them for us.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.536 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They're often
described as being

00:09:06.536 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
eight to nine feet tall.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.344 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes smaller,
but they're also

00:09:09.344 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
described as being
younger, when they're

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
described as being smaller.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So we know that these things
are not just popping out

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:90%
of the ether into existence.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They apparently have
little ones, younger ones,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and older ones.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And these are creatures that
are breeding and multiplying.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever
walk on all fours?

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They do.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
They've been seeing
going to all fours

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
from an upright
position and vice-versa.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
In my research
and investigation,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that some of
the very first sightings

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
occurred in Wisconsin
in the late 1800s

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
at a place known as
Aztalan State Park.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Aztalan, of course, is
an allusion to the Inca home.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a picture
here of a Dogman track.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Really unusual, isn't it?

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:90%
It's usually a three toed print.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
There's part of a
dog's foot that, when

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
you look at how a dog
stands, the pad is actually

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, and then there's
this sort of 45 degree angle

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
bone behind the foot.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these tracks
look like these things

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
have evolved to where
that bone has now

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:90%
been pushed to the ground.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And it's
helping to support

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:90%
the weight of the creature.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me one day that
what we had to be looking at

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
was either an
etheric manifestation

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of this creature through
some form of ancient worship.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Or these native people
came across this creature

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
in the wilds and
began to deify it.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
That there were little
to no other options.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, JC held the belief that
these dog-headed creatures were

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:10%
actually remnants of the
Annunaki, of the Nephilim,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:10%
that they were a genetic
experiment of some kind,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:10%
and that they were--

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Something went awry?

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: They were
a military class.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.981 align:middle line:84%
These particular creatures
were the soldier class.

00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they communicate?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody ever hear them
speaking or anything like that?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: One of the very first
cases occurred at Aztalan State

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Park in 1888, And the gentleman
claims, the eyewitness claims--

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
he was the security guard
of the park at that time--

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that this creature opened its
mouth and spoke words to him.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
language it was,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
but it sounded almost
Egyptian to him.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:10%
Do you think they were
more earthbound creatures

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:10%
or extraterrestrial,
in your opinion?

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That's the million
dollar question right now.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:84%
You know with Sasquatch, through
two different genome studies

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
now, one made public, one which
was conducted in private by Dr.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.195 align:middle line:84%
Ketchum, the private study
was done on behalf of JC

00:11:49.195 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and a few other
investigators when we had

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:90%
discovered DNA of a Sasquatch--

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this the same--

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
you just said that.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.744 align:middle line:84%
It was the same study when she
was looking for Bigfoot, right?

00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:00.544 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: She came to the
conclusion on her Sasquatch

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
study that the mitochondrial
DNA, the DNA on the mother's

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
lineage side, was in
fact, modern day human.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And when she conducted
the Dogman DNA study,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
it too came across mitochondrial
DNA human, Native American.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Sasquatch
study, what it showed

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
was that 12,000 to 15,000
years ago, during what

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
was called the
Younger Dryas Period,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
there was an upright
walking hominid species.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
That species has never been
cataloged in the world gene

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
bank.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the major problem
with Sasquatch DNA.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They have never discovered
the fossilized remains

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of this upright walking
hominid species.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore they have
never actually taken DNA

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
from one of these
fossilized samples

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and made it into the
actual gene bank.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So when they do the
study, it comes up

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
as an unknown relic hominid
species and human female.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, researcher
Scott Carpenter

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.872 align:middle line:84%
had a video of what
could be a Dogman.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT CARPENTER: In this
clip, you're about to see,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:10%
this was my first
encounter with the Dogman.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course, I didn't see
him or know he was watching me.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:10%
I again caught him on
the backdraw camera.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:10%
But I was just looking
around my feeding station,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:10%
checking out my tape
traps for a Bigfoot

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:10%
here and just generally
looking around the area.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:10%
And I caught a few
seconds of the Dogman

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:10%
behind me here in
the brush pile.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And what he's doing,
he's actually looking up

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:90%
and he's watching me.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
He's just got his
head peeked up.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, in this sequence,
he looks more

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:10%
like the traditional
werewolf or Dogman.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:10%
But consistent with the
footage I captured this day,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:10%
he appears to only have one ear.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know whether
an ear was injured

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:10%
and it's just lying
down on his head

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:10%
or it's been bitten
off, removed.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:10%
Who knows?

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:10%
But the creature only has one
ear, and it's the right ear.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:10%
So in this sequence, he
is standing behind me,

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:10%
watching me.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:10%
And there's actually a
very interesting part

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:10%
of this segment, where
the Dogman will actually,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:10%
his ear will actually go--

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:10%
and so his ear will
be flopped over.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:10%
And for whatever
reason the ear goes up.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And just like a dog, he
kind of zooms in on me.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:10%
So that's what's
in this segment.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:10%
I will loop that segment
of the ear going up

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:10%
so it'll be easier to see.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:40.770 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing he was
able to even see this creature

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.882 align:middle line:90%
through all the greenery.

00:16:17.882 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, the great thing
about Scott Carpenter is that

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
he realized early on--

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and Scott is a completely
no nonsense human being.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could tell.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Oh yeah,
I've been in contact

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
with Scott for a
long time, and he's

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
the kind of guy that really
doesn't mess around, what he

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.552 align:middle line:90%
says happened really happened.

00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's talking about a
bent ear and everything else.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.843 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: He's as straight
as the day is long.

00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And he found out, discovered,
that every time he

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.022 align:middle line:84%
was out on a hike, on a hunt, he
could hear activity behind him.

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And he'd turn around, and there
wouldn't be anything there.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So he got to where he would
wear a camera pointing backwards

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
at all times,
filming behind him.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
footage actually came from.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
He reviews that
video every time when

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
he gets home, the
back camera footage,

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and he saw this thing poking
out of the woods looking at him.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something was there.

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was,
but something was there.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
very close up examination

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and slowed down video
of that creature,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.815 align:middle line:90%
it is quite something.

00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It is very, very scary too.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could it be a Bigfoot?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: No, you know, if it is,
it's a new type of Sasquatch

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't know
existed before.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
elongated snouts.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:90%
They look like dogs.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They have upright standing
ears most of the time.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And these things can
stand 9, 10 feet tall.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I've got a
photograph of one of them,

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and it literally had its
arm bent in a 90 degree

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:90%
angle in front of it like this.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And it stood up the entire
time it was being filmed.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
There are frames where it
lifts its nose to the air

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and begins to sniff
our scent on the air.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.035 align:middle line:84%
And you can even see the
pupil of this creature.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, geographically,
where are these creatures

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.555 align:middle line:90%
located?

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:03.138 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, right
now, they're being

00:18:03.138 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
seen in most of the states.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The major hotspot
in North America

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is Michigan, along what they
call the Land of the Lakes.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, been there.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There's a peninsula
there where there's not only

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
a cluster of
historical sightings--

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the upper peninsula?

00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right,
but a growing body

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of sightings taking place
there even as we speak.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Wisconsin, a lot of the
other Great Lakes states

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:90%
that are all along that area.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So primarily
the central states?

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, well,
and from there,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:84%
they seemingly work a trail
down to the Deep South.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And in the Deep South, you know,
around New Orleans, you have

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
Lougarou, which is

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:90%
the French word for "werewolf."

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think they eat?

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know, I
think they're omnivorous,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
just like the
Sasquatch seems to be.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
These things are meat
eaters, but they also

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
seem to have the
ability to forage off

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
of berries and other types
of food available to them

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:90%
in the forest.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Leaves,
things like that.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.195 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, right.

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great
nutritional dinner that is.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, and with
Sasquatch, you

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
can look at the gene
study that was done,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and you can kind
of see why there

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
is a natural scientific
explanation for this creature.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:84%
The Greater Dryas
Period was a period

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
when the Earth had
been struck by a comet.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, species
that have very similar DNA

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
makeups tend to interbreed out
of an innate sense of survival.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And this creature had
a very similar genetic makeup

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
to archaic humans, and
it began to interbreed

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
with archaic human females,
and that produced the lineage

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that we call
Sasquatch or Bigfoot.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there been any
reports of these creatures

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.845 align:middle line:90%
being winged?

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know,
there have been

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
close up reports of
eyewitnesses shooting

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:90%
them, almost point blank range.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.677 align:middle line:84%
And these things
barely even flinching.

00:19:52.677 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
In the Dogmen, in the case
of the Dogmen, and Sasquatch.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.801 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
clearly knew they hit it.

00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
They actually saw the thing
sort of flinch and move,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't appear to do the
damage that they would think

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
some of these weapons would do.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.196 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about guys that
are professional hunters that

00:20:10.196 --> 00:20:11.196 align:middle line:90%
are carrying 30 odd six.

00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good marksmen.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Or an AR-15 or
a 45 caliber handgun.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
These aren't people out in
the woods with a BB gun.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're shooting
them pretty close up,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
and seemingly it has no effect.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could these
creatures, Jack, be Mothman?

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: I don't believe so.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
descriptions of Mothman

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
being a winged
creature, that's not

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
something that often
occurs in Dogman sightings.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Over the past year
or two, there's

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:10%
been a huge number of so-called
Mothman, Owlman, giant bat

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:10%
sightings going on around
the Greater Chicago Area.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
That's something that's been
chronicled very detailed

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
by Phantoms and Monsters and
among a few other investigative

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And we as well have gotten
nonstop eyewitnesses,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
including one lady who
was able to give us

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
a very, very detailed
account of what she saw.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
She said the creature was only
100 feet from her, very, very

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
long batwing-like wings,
in excess of 12 to 15 feet

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
wingspan.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:84%
She said this
thing looked to her

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
like a real biological
creature, that it was

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
wasn't something
that was appearing

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.847 align:middle line:84%
from another
dimension, let's say.

00:21:29.847 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's gotta scare
the living daylights out

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of people when they're
confronted by these things.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Many of the witnesses are just
petrified by what they saw.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't be, right?

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah, right.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.871 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
seen one, up and personal?

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I have not
seen one, but we

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:84%
do have a photograph sent to
us by one of the eyewitnesses,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can see in
pretty decent detail what

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.522 align:middle line:90%
these creatures are.

00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nobody would
be dumb enough, Jack,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.964 align:middle line:84%
to put a costume on
and go running around?

00:21:57.964 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: No, when you look
at the photograph and some

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of the descriptions of what
this thing is, you're left

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:90%
wondering what it could be.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when these
things take off,

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
they hear flapping of
wings, but it's not

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
like they hear a
jetpack going off

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.261 align:middle line:84%
or the sound of a drone
flying or something like that.

00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They can see the
creature breathing,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and they see the eyes glowing.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:84%
There's an instant paralyzing
feeling of fear among them.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of the eyewitness accounts
have been multiple people,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
one of them there
was over 20 people

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
who saw the creature in the
same area around Chicago.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So why they're appearing in
that area, we don't really know.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Are they a
Mothman-like creature?

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, some would say that the
descriptions are very, very

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
similar to what
people were seeing

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.015 align:middle line:90%
in Point Pleasant at the time.

00:22:44.015 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Other theories include
that perhaps this is either

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
a new species of what we
would call a flying fox.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:90%
There are giant bat species.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a big
flying fox, right?

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There are very large
bat species in Indonesia

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere called the
golden crown flying fox.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very, very big bat.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this thing's got
a body that's at least 4

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 feet in length.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, that would
be horrible to look at.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four foot bat.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Maybe you're
seeing a migration

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
of a type of species like that.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're seeing an evolution
that this is a new species,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and maybe, just
maybe, these things

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:84%
are being born from
dormant prehistoric eggs.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
There are many scientific
studies talking about the idea

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that some of the
prehistoric species

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
could lay eggs in the earth
that would survive for hundreds

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.812 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:23:36.812 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then they hatch?

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.186 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Eventually to hatch.

00:23:39.186 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's global warming,
some other type of mechanism

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
that's causing them to hatch.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're
witnessing the rebirth

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.235 align:middle line:90%
of a prehistoric species.

00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now let's
talk about Bigfoot

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and what the heck this
creature might be.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Because I hear everything, Jack.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I hear extraterrestrial,
dimensional, an animal.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think Bigfoot is?

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I don't
believe for a second

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:09.467 align:middle line:84%
that Bigfoot is either
inter-dimensional or an alien.

00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do not.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.695 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Flying UFOs around.

00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is true, and many
paranormal investigators

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:84%
like to sort of
gloss over the fact

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
that in 20% of all
credible Bigfoot sightings

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.035 align:middle line:90%
a UFO is also reported.

00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:25.951 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: At the same time.

00:24:25.951 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:90%
20% a large number.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a huge number.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
When I began to investigate
the human abduction

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, of what appears
to be humans being taken

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
by an alien species for
a genetic experiment

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.637 align:middle line:90%
or testing some kind of.

00:24:41.637 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at David Paulides.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.985 align:middle line:84%
Well, I suspect the same thing
is happening with Sasquatch.

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.253 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now that we
have a genome study that

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
shows that they are part,
in fact, modern human,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and we have the same
alien craft in close

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
proximity to a creature
that shares DNA with us,

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that we know
that alien abduction of humans

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is going on, it's not too
far of a stretch to assume

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that these creatures are also
being abducted for their DNA.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can only
imagine what the ETs are

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
thinking of these creatures.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a big video
that splashed the Bigfoot

00:25:15.593 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:90%
community some time ago.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: As it goes from
upright down to all fours,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm wondering, does that
look like a primate?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:10%


00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:10%
Like if we were
sitting or standing

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:10%
and fell over on all fours?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:10%
Or does it look like an animal
with its center of gravity

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:10%
a little further
back, a little lower?

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have an
example for that,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.922 align:middle line:10%
so take that with
a grain of salt.

00:25:50.922 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
could see something

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:90%
popping up and popping down.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Was that the creature?

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That's the creature
that more than one researcher

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
has now filmed out
in the deep woods.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the original films
was called "Three Miles Deep

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
with Bob Garrett," who in
Bigfoot circles is well known.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Bob attracted the
wrong kind of attention

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:90%
by posting that video.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I meant government
figures approaching him.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And now he's untraceable.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't find Bob anywhere.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to Bob Garrett.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.448 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: But after this video
called "Three Miles In," where

00:26:27.448 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
he apparently films
what we would call

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
a predator-like
creature, a creature

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that has the ability,
just like the movie, to

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
fully cloak itself in such
a way that all you see

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is a basic shimmering of light
when it moves in front of you.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And one has to
imagine, when you look

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
into things like Project
Mockingbird run by the CIA,

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood,
predictive programming

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
were they in fact using
the "Predator" movies

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
as a type of soft disclosure
for what our researchers are now

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.967 align:middle line:90%
actually filming in the woods?

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To slowly let us
know or maybe it is just

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.404 align:middle line:90%
to leak the information out?

00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right,
that's what I mean,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
a soft disclosure without
actually coming out and saying,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, you guys, we've got what
apparently is a completely

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:84%
invisible, perhaps
interdimensional predator

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:90%
walking around the woods.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the
way, there's a man

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:84%
named David Paulides
who has published

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.515 align:middle line:84%
nonstop missing person cases
all through the national park

00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:23.315 align:middle line:90%

for an explosive combination

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:84%
invisible predator-like beings
walking around the woods,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
but, hey, we've got
hundreds and hundreds

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.130 align:middle line:84%
of unsolved missing
people cases,

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
where we just haven't
a clue as to what

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:90%
happened to these people.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.145 align:middle line:84%

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They may be walking--
you and I and somebody else

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
might be walking in
the woods in tandem.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And we walk two feet in front of
this other individual, hearing

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:84%
nothing, we turn
around and he's gone.

>>NOORY: Where the heck is he?

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:84%
An animal would
have made a noise

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
if it came down
and snatched him.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Or he would have screamed.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they walk
into a dimension, a portal,

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.307 align:middle line:84%
or they're instantly
beamed somewhere and taken.

00:28:15.307 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Quite right.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And that leads me
into the theory

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that I developed
regarding the missing 411

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
cases, which has to do
with what scientists

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:90%
call the mock effect.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mock
effect is something

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered
not too long ago,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and there is a scientist
who's developed what's

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:90%
called a mock effect thruster.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The mock effect.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, named after
the scientist who actually

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:90%
discovered this mechanism.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And basically to make a very
complicated scientific theorem

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
simple, when mass
travels through space,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
there are minute fluctuations
that occur in that mass.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, interesting theory.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And there is a scientific way
of harnessing the energy caused

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:84%
by those fluctuations,
so that you in effect

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:90%
have zero point energy.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hm.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now, I had been

sites, what you find

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:84%
are electromagnetic field
patterns, which are way above.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unusual?

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, these
different areas actually

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
have, underneath the
topography, vast quantities

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:90%
of quartz crystal.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
These quartz crystals can
generate electromagnetic waves

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that they are
magnified hundreds of times

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.125 align:middle line:84%
over the surrounding
countryside.

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.458 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now, there's plenty of
scientists in the world that

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:84%
will tell you, like Michio
Kaku, other physicists,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and in a lot of
their conferences,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
in hushed tones, as we
would say right now,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
they are discussing the
very real possibility

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that their mathematics
are showing

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:84%
to them that parallel
dimensions do exist,

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and that if they
exist, there are more

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
than likely intelligent beings
living on those dimensions,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and that some of these
beings would have discovered

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.909 align:middle line:90%
a way into this one by now.

00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And take people.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's right.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we have
at these vortex areas.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
separating two dimensions

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
is what they call an
electromagnetic membrane.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And what you have
with the mock effect

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:84%
is the Earth, a body of mass
traveling through space,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
having minute fluctuations
in the topography

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
of these quartz
crystal deposits,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
which then generate
electromagnetic field

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
patterns so strong that they can
literally cause a tear or a rip

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic membrane
between dimensions.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can have momentary
interaction taking

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.491 align:middle line:84%
place between these
dimensions, and that's

00:30:43.491 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
what we call paranormal.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.531 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or fall into it.

00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
David Paulides, of
course, "Missing 411,"

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.545 align:middle line:84%
was a recent guest
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:50.545 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID PAULIDES:
Thanks, George.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.836 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:30:52.836 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it about
this subject that got you first

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
involved in investigating it?

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Years ago, I was
doing some peripheral research

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:90%
in a national park.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:10%
I noticed a couple park
rangers following me around,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:10%
which isn't that unusual.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:10%
And I went back to my
location off the park site,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
and these guys showed
up independently,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:10%
and they said they
knew of me, and they

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:10%
had been looking into missing
people at the various parks

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:10%
that they had worked at.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.885 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And they realized
that on the front end, when

00:31:22.885 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
somebody goes missing,
there's a lot of activity,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of investigation.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.102 align:middle line:84%
And then after about seven or
eight days, everything stops.

00:31:31.102 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And when they tried to find
out what happened to the victim

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and get more information,
they were stymied,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and they said something
didn't feel right.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.468 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And then subsequent
to the disappearance,

00:31:41.468 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the follow up investigation
by special agents of the Park

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Service really never happened.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.461 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Very strange.

00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said somebody ought
to be looking into this,

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
because the people were
disappearing in areas that they

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.690 align:middle line:84%
didn't think that would
fit that normal mode.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you and
I, say, take our kids

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to the park and a
child disappears

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:84%
in a valley area, where
there's a lot of activity.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking far
back into the back country.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these occur
right in a populated area

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.274 align:middle line:90%
of the national park.

00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In front
of other people.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Apparently.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And as we
can logically assume,

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:84%
when people go into the
back country, things happen.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And those disappearances
occur as well,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's those valley
disappearances that

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.610 align:middle line:90%
got my interest right away.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, your mind
may go immediately to, well,

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
it's some kind of person
to person involvement.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, some sicko
out there or something.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.392 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Right, but when
you get into the numbers,

00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
vet the cases, you

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
realize that something
more is going on

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:90%
than what's readily apparent.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have tried
for years to get

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
David to commit to what
he thinks is happening,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and he just won't
go there, Jack.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know, he's keeping
all options open at this stage,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
because, to him,
there's just not

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.020 align:middle line:84%
enough information in to
make a delineation one way

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:90%
or the other.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:84%
He did pay me a very
good compliment,

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and he's read my
article concerning--

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a
great researcher.

00:33:06.405 --> 00:33:07.655 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: The mock effect, yeah.

00:33:07.655 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And said that I was one of the
few writers that could actually

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.170 align:middle line:84%
with logic explain a possible
mechanism by which some of this

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
could occur.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And with the 411
missing cases, you

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:26.055 align:middle line:84%
might actually be looking at
two or three different things

00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:26.855 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.541 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: At the same time.

00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think that, deep
down, he kind of suspects

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
what I suspect, and that's that
these physicists are right,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
interdimensional predator

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
of some kind doing this work,
that he says all the time,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:84%
because of the first or last
in line part of the pattern,

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
there has to be an intelligence
behind what's going on.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I think whatever it is
that's actually doing

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
this is from another dimension.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It has realized that
in these specific areas

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:84%
there are intermittent doorways
through which they can operate.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.959 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the park
systems primarily?

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Well, it's interesting.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to be a
coincidence that the park

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
systems are all forest, where
the underlying topography has

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:84%
huge amounts of limestone
and quartz crystal.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.355 align:middle line:84%
And so it's usually
in these areas

00:34:21.355 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:84%
where they put
the national parks

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that you have these huge
electromagnetic patterns taking

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
place, these fields
that can actually

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
cause the interaction
between dimensions.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The field
of cryptozoology

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.851 align:middle line:84%
primarily was for Bigfoot, I
believe, originally, wasn't it?

00:34:38.851 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It was,
although if you look

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
at the work of Loren Coleman,
all manner of strange animals.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thunderbirds.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Thunderbirds, large
snakes, creatures of all kinds

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that really don't quite
fit into the accepted

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.920 align:middle line:90%
version of evolution.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
Loch Ness monster

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.462 align:middle line:84%
and a whole body
of sea creatures

00:35:00.462 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
that fit into crypto
field as well.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.961 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great mysteries.

00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Just great mysteries.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.242 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have
answers to this planet?

00:35:06.242 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:90%
We've been to the moon.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.880 align:middle line:90%
We sent rovers to Mars.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We sent space ships outside
of our solar system.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we find out
what's happening right here?

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: If we had the
right kind of funding

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and the right amount of time.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem
with cryptozoology--

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.550 align:middle line:84%
it is completely unfunded
anywhere in the world.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:84%
JC used to often tell
me, "Jack, do you

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:84%
wanna make money
hunting Bigfoot?

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself a
rule early morning

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
newspaper route, because
that's about the only money

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you're ever gonna make
hunting a cryptid animal."

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
There is simply no
funding in this field,

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.297 align:middle line:84%
and it's always on our
own time and our own dime

00:35:45.297 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
where we go out and collect the
evidence that we've collected.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're proud
of what we've been

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:84%
able to collect on
very limited funding

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.105 align:middle line:90%
and therefore very limited time.

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.240 align:middle line:84%
We called each other "underpaid
public servants" all the time,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.940 align:middle line:84%
because we very much see
this as a public service,

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to not only show
that some of this phenomenon

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:84%
is real, but are trying
to ascertain as to

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.870 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it presents
a real threat to humanity.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of these
411 missing victims,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.547 align:middle line:84%
you might have
exactly that scenario.

00:36:19.547 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a great,
great puzzling story.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the same time
too, Jack, it's frightening.

00:36:24.325 --> 00:36:25.125 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because little
kids have disappeared.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine as a parent
how horrible that must be,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.316 align:middle line:90%
because you get no answer.

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
part of the frustration.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no closure
here, is there?

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No closure.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And every day we wake up and the
Sasquatch enigma's still there,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
after a while, it
creates a sore spot.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You want to
see this resolved.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
quite understand

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that what we're dealing
with is a creature that

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:84%
has a human-like intelligence
but superhuman-like physical

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:84%
A creature that can
run 55 miles an hour

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
over uneven mountainous terrain,
can scale a 90 degree rock face

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:90%
in seconds.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But doesn't
seem to attack people.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Doesn't necessarily.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We do have some evidence
where they may have

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:90%
attacked and killed humans.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.909 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are instances.

00:37:11.909 --> 00:37:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: May be provoked.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: A few cases, yeah.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times,
they simply flee.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But these creatures are more
than what people give them

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.720 align:middle line:90%
credit for.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:84%
This isn't some dumb great
ape wandering around the wilds

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:90%
of North America.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
it's not an animal.

00:37:26.928 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And there's hundreds of
millions of uninhabited forest

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:84%
acreage all around
North America.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And a creature with
those abilities,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
a creature that can smell
you from two miles away,

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.025 align:middle line:90%
can see you a mile away.

00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've heard recordings
of these creatures in the past.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
kind of frightening.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:90%
They're just-- rawr.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.145 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, there's nothing
more unnerving than hearing

00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:84%
a Sasquatch roar, which I
had the pleasure of hearing

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:84%
a number of times
going out with JC.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
the bat-like creature

00:37:53.283 --> 00:37:54.139 align:middle line:90%
again in Chicago.

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: We're trying to
determine exactly what this is.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be an actual
biological creature.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't appear to be
someone in one of those flying

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:90%
squirrel suits.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:90%
This thing has been seen.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is actually
up in the air, right?

00:38:07.268 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, it is
actually flying.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is that?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: We don't really
know because it's

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:84%
hard to tell a
scale of an object

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
in the sky when there's
nothing else there,

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:84%
but this was taken
from quite a distance

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
by an eyewitness who
happened to come out

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.180 align:middle line:84%
of a strip mall around
Chicago and see this way off

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in the distance and was able
to zoom in that far to actually

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:90%
get a picture of it.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Many eyewitnesses have seen
them perched on street lights,

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and, with one or two flaps,
just disappear into a night sky.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, you
could see the back feet.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could see
the hands or the paws

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:84%
on the end of the
wings, like a bat.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can see the head.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
thing that comes to mind

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.670 align:middle line:84%
are the pteratorn and
pteradactyl sightings

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that were reported to
me and JC that occur all

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.955 align:middle line:90%
through the American Southwest.

00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and that's a
skin-looking wing, isn't it?

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
of course you were

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:84%
talking about the tombstone of
the lady that was apparently

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:90%
eaten by human wolves.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
she is, Katherine.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yup, Katherine
Cross was her name.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, this case was
actually given to me

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:84%
by an actual
private investigator

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:90%
operating in Oklahoma.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: She had come across this
case through an acquaintance

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and became so obsessed with
it that she literally moved

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
to the small town of Konawa.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Only 18-years-old.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah, 18-years-old.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And right at the
bottom, when you look closely,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
it says "murdered
by human wolves."

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that right
underneath her death date?

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: The actual date, yeah.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's an inscription
found on other tombstones

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:90%
throughout the area.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were the
Little People in Minnesota?

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.985 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, the Little
People were something

00:40:00.985 --> 00:40:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that JC had come across, and
he found a gentleman that's

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
a member of the Crypto
Four Quarters now

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.540 align:middle line:84%
who had a 300 acre
property up there that had

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:90%
this activity going on it.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And up there, the
Native American people

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
called them the Bagwajiwinini,
the little people

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:90%
of the forest.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small were they?

00:40:18.788 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They're only 16
inches tall, basically.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They were small.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in
Northern Ireland,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:90%
they'd be called leprechauns.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Leprechauns.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And what blew me
away when we actually

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
obtained a photograph of one
of these creatures in Minnesota

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is that they had literally
just discovered Homo

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.329 align:middle line:90%
Floresiensis off the coast of--

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here, Jack?

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.828 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: This is one
of the Bagwajiwinini.

00:40:41.828 --> 00:40:45.205 align:middle line:84%
He's peering out
from the underbrush.

00:40:45.205 --> 00:40:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He looks like one
of those gizmos in the movie.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the actual
photograph which they've got,

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:84%
this is the extreme
close up, this little guy

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:84%
was peering up
out of the bushes,

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and we happened to snap
a photograph of him.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he waving?

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: He's not waving.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Only his head was up, and he
was eyeballing the group there.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks flat.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: He does.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the skull
kind of looks flat.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.226 align:middle line:84%
And like I was saying,
this occurred shortly

00:41:13.226 --> 00:41:14.600 align:middle line:84%
after the discovery
of the Hobbit

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.877 align:middle line:90%
species, Homo Floresiensis.

00:41:16.877 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like a
little teddy bear or something.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And here we've got another
Native American lore

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:90%
about a Hobbit species.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And this just happens
to be in North America.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.550 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly you can see
his little fingers on that hand.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You see that?

00:41:31.616 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, and
both eyes, you see

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
the nasal structure, the bone
structure underneath the skin.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No nose, or
is it covered there?

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Very, very straight,
yeah, and flat-faced.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is that hair
that we're looking at?

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It could very well be.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We asked the Native
Americans about the color

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of the creature, and they
said that they mainly

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
eat a chlorophyll
diet, and that they

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:90%
were largely green in nature.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Ireland,
they of course,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:84%
have the myth of
leprechauns, but they also

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:84%
have the story of these little
green people capturing children

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and taking them
whenever they see them.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about that?

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.760 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Ireland, they
were known as the gentry.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And they lived in little,
tiny holes in the ground,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and they were responsible
for all kinds of fairy

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.059 align:middle line:84%
misadventures and
kidnapping of children.

00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Debauchery, huh?

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, and all
kinds of mischief.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you find
in the North American lore

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.747 align:middle line:90%
with the Bagwajiwinini is--

00:42:33.747 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: An exact description.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And then you have an
actual scientific finding

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.724 align:middle line:10%
of this Hobbit species,
Homo floresiensis.

00:42:41.724 --> 00:42:43.765 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That could look
like little leprechauns.

00:42:43.765 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Which looks exactly like
what they've been describing.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Here's a tiny, little pygmy race
of people that really existed,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.740 align:middle line:10%
and they hunted little pygmy
animals, little pygmy elephants

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.510 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:84%
On the East Coast, you have
what's called the Pukwudgie,

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:84%
the oral history
of the Pukwudgie,

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.160 align:middle line:84%
which is another
little troll-like,

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.963 align:middle line:84%
human-like creature that
the Native Americans would

00:43:05.963 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:90%
speak of.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
myth of leprechauns

00:43:07.508 --> 00:43:09.350 align:middle line:84%
may very well not
be a myth after all.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: May not be a myth.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Even in Norway they have
the ancient oral history

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of the little people.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.006 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Norway, when
they build a highway,

00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:18.567 align:middle line:84%
they'll build a highway
around a rock structure,

00:43:18.567 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:84%
because they believe the
little people live in it.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to disrupt.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They take it
that seriously, yeah.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about the little people,

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is something Mr.
Paulides has come across

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that the Native
Americans have blamed them

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.432 align:middle line:84%
over the years for being
responsible for missing people.

00:43:34.432 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little
tiny creatures?

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: The little guys, yeah.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
missing person case

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.530 align:middle line:84%
shortly before Crypto
Four Corners obtained

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that photograph, that a
gentleman went missing

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.850 align:middle line:90%
in Minnesota in that area.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the whole activity
was in fact blamed on

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.280 align:middle line:90%
by the Native Americans there.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of everything
you've investigated

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.330 align:middle line:84%
crypto-wise, what fascinates
you the most right now?

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: The Dogmen
fascinate me the most,

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the things
I really wanna touch on.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:06.940 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the DNA, you have

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.480 align:middle line:84%
a viable scientific
explanation for Sasquatch.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a viable
scientific explanation

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:84%
for an upright walking
canine species.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's haunting.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the picture that was
obtained in the Lost Creek

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.650 align:middle line:84%
wilderness that
we will show here,

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:90%
that creature's still out there.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many do
you think are out there?

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: With Sasquatch, we
predict 5,000 to 10,000,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because that's how many you have
to have for a viable breeding

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
Dogman in Lost Creek.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You can see him holding
his arm in front of him.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.820 align:middle line:84%
He's got huge pectoral
muscles, upright canine ears.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very hairy.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.638 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: This photograph,
you can actually

00:44:51.638 --> 00:44:52.750 align:middle line:90%
see the iris of the eye.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:53.686 align:middle line:90%
It stood upright.

00:44:53.686 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say, "Oh,
that had to be a bear."

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, this thing stood upright
at least nine feet tall.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that hair on the--

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes, dark black hair.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But it stood upright for
over a 15 minute period.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's a slightly
different photo

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of him, the mouth,
the nose, the eyes,

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
ear off to the right.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see the iris right
here in that left eye.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
few frames of film

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
where he was actually
sniffing the air

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.189 align:middle line:84%
and picking up the
scent of something.

00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, looking at
these photos helps of Dogman,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.980 align:middle line:84%
we get a pretty
good glimpse of what

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.720 align:middle line:84%
it looks like, but specifically
describe it for us.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were at a
forensic event, trying

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to tell an artist what to
sketch, what would you say?

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: A typical
Dogman sighting,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.500 align:middle line:84%
the creature is always
described as being

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from seven to nine
feet tall, sometimes taller.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:84%
They're massive, described
as being massive animals.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:84%
They have a canine-like
head on them

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.022 align:middle line:84%
with a protruding snout,
upright ears, same thing

00:45:53.022 --> 00:45:53.980 align:middle line:90%
you would see on a dog.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A dog face.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, but
they're not described

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.690 align:middle line:84%
as having paws but
more human-like

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:02.312 align:middle line:90%
hands, with an opposable thumb.

00:46:02.312 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the feet?

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And the feet,
in the knee area,

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
these animals are
described almost

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.750 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of the
witnesses describe

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:10.281 align:middle line:90%
the legs as being on backwards.

00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:90%
That's how they describe them.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:14.849 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very weird
sort of evolutionary process

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:90%
that seems to have taken place.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The knees stick
out in a different way, huh?

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They do.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way for
dog-like legs to be

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%
able to support
upright running weight.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at some
of these descriptions,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.420 align:middle line:84%
you think to yourself,
how could somebody

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:84%
with no scientific
background end up

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
drawing of a picture of a
creature that's anatomically

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary correct
if it were going to be

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.955 align:middle line:90%
an upright walking creature?

00:46:36.955 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And yet sometimes
they run off and on all fours?

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, they do
go down to all fours.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And Sasquatch too has
been reported many times

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.170 align:middle line:90%
being on all fours.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked
about Bigfoot

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:90%
running about 55 miles an hour.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:51.970 align:middle line:90%
What about Dogman?

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Dogman seems strangely
similar in that speed.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.747 align:middle line:84%
We don't know an exact mile
per hour, nor with Sasquatch.

00:46:58.747 --> 00:46:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they're fast.

>>CARY: But they
are very, very fast.

00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:84%

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.440 align:middle line:84%
come to us with
descriptions of them

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.450 align:middle line:84%
say that this thing,
when it moved,

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.572 align:middle line:84%
it moved so fast it was
a blur in the woods.

00:47:09.572 --> 00:47:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Upright or on fours?

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Upright even.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.695 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, they
can move that fast.

00:47:13.695 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put them in
the Olympics, huh?

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.739 align:middle line:84%
Here's apparently a creature
that is still living,

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
it's breathing, it's walking
around out in those woods.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
convinced it exists?

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:22.921 align:middle line:90%

00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:24.461 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are
seeing something.

00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the other
remarkable thing, Jack,

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:27.243 align:middle line:90%
about these stories.

00:47:27.243 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they may
be, whether they're

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.050 align:middle line:84%
UFO cases, Bigfoot
cases, the Dogman,

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:90%
people are seeing something.

>>CARY: Yes.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not
making this stuff up.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Not making it up.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.423 align:middle line:84%
And they have no
reason to make it up.

00:47:38.423 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of them only have something
to lose by making it up.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Friends and family
calling them crazy.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no money,
no payoff for it.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them, like in
the Liquid Lichen Case,

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
the eyewitness didn't
even want his name known.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And this man's credibility
was beyond reproach.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago
in St. Louis, we

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:84%
had lived where there
was a small creek

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:90%
in some woods behind us.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.305 align:middle line:84%
And my son must have been
eight or nine years old,

00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:07.180 align:middle line:84%
would like to walk around
there a little bit.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't let him walk
into the woods for fear

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't get back.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But he went in there one day,
and he comes running out, just

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:90%
running out in a panic.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:90%
"Dad, Dad, Dad, help, help!"

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm grabbing the
little guy, right?

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I could see and hear
about 100 feet behind him

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.930 align:middle line:84%
the crackling in the woods
of obviously some creature

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.590 align:middle line:90%
or something running after him.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw, Jack,
was a dark figure.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought, is
there some sick guy

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.130 align:middle line:90%
out in the woods or something?

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It was more of an animal,
much like a Bigfoot.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And it just stopped in its
tracks and then took off again.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
clearly I could hear

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.660 align:middle line:90%
it running through the woods.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
know what it was.

00:48:58.695 --> 00:48:59.500 align:middle line:90%
In the midwest.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And it probably
sounded bipedal.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it did.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.824 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, and that's what
people are often coming across.

00:49:06.824 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They only hear the noises
and sounds, but then

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.902 align:middle line:84%
when something starts
throwing rocks at them.

00:49:10.902 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it gonna
grab my little boy?

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It's very possible.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
plenty of accounts

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:90%
of them stealing children.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
David was very

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.630 align:middle line:84%
interested in that
Sasquatch possibility

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.120 align:middle line:84%
early on in the 411
Missing Person Cases.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.640 align:middle line:84%
He did entertain the
possibility of Sasquatch

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.520 align:middle line:84%
being the reason why these
people are going missing,

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.340 align:middle line:84%
but I think over time he's
realized that it's something

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.750 align:middle line:90%
much larger than that.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, what about
government experiments?

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.610 align:middle line:84%
We've always heard about
the Island of Dr. Moreau,

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.460 align:middle line:84%
but what if there's
a lab somewhere,

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.950 align:middle line:84%
where government
is testing, maybe

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to make a superhuman being,
a soldier, or something,

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but something has gone
awry, and they've let it out

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.310 align:middle line:84%
into the community or
something has happened.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.809 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, it's
something that JC

00:49:58.809 --> 00:50:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and I often discussed was the
fact that these creatures were

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.620 align:middle line:84%
apparently genetically
manipulated before.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Our government and
military has the ability

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.381 align:middle line:84%
to do that same sort
of manipulation now.

00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we did it.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.838 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, what
would keep them

00:50:11.838 --> 00:50:15.515 align:middle line:84%
from continuing to meddle in
some of this DNA manipulation?

00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:17.919 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did we let
them go, or did they escape?

00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It's interesting.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I think the creatures
were already there.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They ended up
capturing them, and I

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:25.140 align:middle line:84%
think, in the case
of Sasquatch, they've

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:28.800 align:middle line:84%
attempted to militarize
it, to weaponize it.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do know
that most hunters,

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:35.260 align:middle line:84%
if they were in the woods,
would try to kill Dogman.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.779 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You, I would think,
would try to capture Dogman.

00:50:38.779 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Love to have him.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
big difference there.

00:50:41.486 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Love to have a
living specimen, yeah.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we don't know what
role these creatures are really

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:48.450 align:middle line:90%
playing.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Do they really pose
a threat to humans

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.160 align:middle line:84%
or are they just wanting
to be left alone?

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the great enigma.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people would
argue that with Sasquatch you

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
have to 5, 10,000 animals
for a viable breeding pool.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Why not take one,
one specimen as a sample?

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you see anything
mystical about the Dogman?

00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:07.200 align:middle line:90%
.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a creature
that was deified by

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.230 align:middle line:84%
not only the Inca but quite
a few other indigenous

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:84%
peoples, and even by
the Egyptians in Anubis.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
in a tent in the woods

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and either Sasquatch or Dogman
open up the tent to look in

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:84%
or come in, which one would
you want in that tent with you?

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Sasquatch by far.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't scare me.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, much
safer, you think?

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They don't
scare me nearly as bad.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
Sasquatch, although they

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.800 align:middle line:84%
can be aggressive, it's
usually the breeding age

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.320 align:middle line:84%
males that are aggressive,
not the younger

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.420 align:middle line:90%
ones and not the females.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually only
during their breeding season

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.320 align:middle line:90%
that they're aggressive.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And other than that, they
seem very benign species.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:55.950 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be a type of
human, a type of people that

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.390 align:middle line:90%
simply want to be left alone.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.069 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they travel
in human family-like units.

00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
believe that they're

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.150 align:middle line:90%
indigenous to this planet?

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:05.782 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes, I absolutely do.

00:52:05.782 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.730 align:middle line:90%
How do they track what you do?

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You can always
find me on Facebook, just

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.710 align:middle line:90%
under Jack Cary.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.480 align:middle line:84%
The Paranormal
Intelligence Agency

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:90%
also has a Facebook page.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.280 align:middle line:84%
There are many
ways to contact me.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're always looking
for new cases to look into.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they keep
coming, don't they?

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They do.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more people contact us
with actual evidence and cases

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:42.570 align:middle line:84%
for us to investigate,
the sooner

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to prove
that a lot of this phenomenon

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is taking place and present
that to the public at large.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of the community

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
has lost a great crypto
with JC Johnson gone?

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Oh, the
cryptozoology world

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.407 align:middle line:90%
will never be the same again.

00:52:59.407 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Devastated.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: His contributions
to that field cannot even be

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:90%
measured.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The amount of credibility
that the man operated with

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and brought to that
field is something

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.620 align:middle line:90%
that can never be replaced.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The simple integrity
that he brought

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:20.120 align:middle line:84%
to it and the unwillingness
to ever give up.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.230 align:middle line:84%
He was probably the
toughest man I ever knew.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:26.700 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much ridicule,
no matter how many people would

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.690 align:middle line:84%
shout "Hoax, fakes, you're
a liar," he knew the truth.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that
really mattered to JC,

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:36.154 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the reasons I
loved working with him so much.

00:53:36.154 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good for you.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great experience,
something you'll never forget?

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Oh, yeah.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.459 align:middle line:84%
JC taught me more in a few
years than most cryptozoologists

00:53:44.459 --> 00:53:45.500 align:middle line:90%
will learn in a lifetime.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he loved
what he did, didn't he?

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.308 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Oh, absolutely.

00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:49.202 align:middle line:84%
He was truly in love
with what he did.

00:53:49.202 --> 00:53:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
tell just in the video

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that he was excited about
everything he touched.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Oh, right, right.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't about
monetary gain to JC.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:00.030 align:middle line:84%
JC lived a very Spartan,
sparse lifestyle.

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was because he
dedicated so much of his time

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to being out in
the field unpaid.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And most people, they think
that, oh, these guys are just

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.060 align:middle line:90%
in it to make money.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.210 align:middle line:84%
No, they're in it because
they love what they do.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's not
a lot of money to make.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
one of these creatures,

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe you can become PT Barnum.

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, that's
what I was gonna say.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the absence
of that, in void of that,

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:24.630 align:middle line:84%
you're not gonna
make a lot of money.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.505 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You're not gonna
make a lot of money,

00:54:26.505 --> 00:54:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have a
lot of people coming down

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.610 align:middle line:84%
on you, saying
that this is fake,

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and that you're a liar,
and so on and so forth.

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:36.485 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And we
continue to do it.

00:54:36.485 --> 00:54:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I continue to do it, because
we know that it's real.

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We focus on evidence
that has real viability

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and scientific backing to it.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We try to weed out anything that
could possibly have been a hoax

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and not even
concentrate on that.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And on the PIA website,
we concentrate on quality

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.491 align:middle line:90%
rather than quantity.

00:54:58.491 --> 00:54:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's important.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.590 align:middle line:10%
When I founded the
PIA, I founded a group

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:10%
that I couldn't find, and made
a website I couldn't find,

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.190 align:middle line:10%
which was a paranormal
investigation body

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and website that actually
was collecting the real deal

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:16.060 align:middle line:10%
evidence and filtering
through all of the stuff

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.764 align:middle line:10%
that you could readily dismiss.

00:55:17.764 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, thanks for
sharing your time with us.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Thank you very much.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, this
is a fascinating field.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The search for Bigfoot,
Dogman, David Paulides' work

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.950 align:middle line:84%
of why people are simply
disappearing and missing.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And as Jack has been mentioning,
the loss of JC Johnson

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:42.200 align:middle line:10%
is huge in the cryptozoology
field, not to be replaced.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.480 align:middle line:10%
So we'll never forget.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
