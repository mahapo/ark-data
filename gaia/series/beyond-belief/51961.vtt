00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.576 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.442 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Think of your darkest
hour in your life.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Did you seriously contemplate
maybe killing yourself?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:10%
Well that's what happened to
our special guest Jim Paris,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:10%
author of "Pray for
a Financial Miracle."

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.775 align:middle line:10%
You really thought
about doing yourself in?

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES PARIS: George, I
planned my own suicide out

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:10%
in detail on three occasions.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:10%
And I came very, very close.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were
that despondent?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.535 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: I was.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.689 align:middle line:10%
I reached the point
where I didn't

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:10%
want to wake up in the morning.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I had nightmares about
what was happening to me

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:10%
and every-- where I was
at in life, all the money

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.624 align:middle line:10%
I had lost, how
bleak my future was.

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to live.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.153 align:middle line:90%
It was just so painful.

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, to wake
up in the morning,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
within five seconds it would
come back to me that, OK.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
This is my reality again.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't want
to live another day.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You lost a
couple million dollars

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:10%
because your brother
had embezzled money

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
from the firm that you were both
working at, your advisory firm.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And once you realized that,
why didn't you just say,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:90%
aw heck with it.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.979 align:middle line:84%
Why kill yourself over
something like that, Jim?

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, you know,
what happened with me, I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.728 align:middle line:84%
made the mistake that
a lot of people do,

00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
was I had tied up my
self esteem and my self

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.325 align:middle line:84%
worth into what I
did for a living.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And so here I was traveling
all around the country,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the financial genius,
writing financial books.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They're sending limousines
to the airport to pick me up.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm on all the big TV
shows and so forth.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:84%
How could I go back and
be on another TV program

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
or ever be called on to
give financial advice when

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I myself had not only just lost
all of my operating capital,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
$2 million, but also in the
process of my brother cooking

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
the books, I had
basically, in essence,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.769 align:middle line:84%
sort of drummed myself out
of the regulated securities

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:90%
business because of that.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So my meal ticket,
the goose that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
was laying the golden
egg, if you will,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
my securities licensing,
was all also destroyed

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
as a result of what
my brother did.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So it was not only
just the loss of money,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
but the loss of any way to
recoup that money any way

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:90%
that I knew how.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the age of 21,
I had made my living mostly

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
from the securities industry.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, saw that
coming to an end.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The analogy would be a
lawyer who was disbarred,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and spent his whole life getting
ready to go to college and law

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
school--

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wasn't trained
to do anything else.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.199 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Passing the
bar exam, and then he

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.571 align:middle line:90%
loses his law license.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
where I was at, George.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
At a point where I believed
I had nothing to live for.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it
take you, Jim, to rebound?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, you
know, it was a process.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could tell
people, well you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
know what, I had an epiphany,
and the next morning I

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
was just great.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It really took me
about five years.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you that
during those years

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.497 align:middle line:90%
I found a different person.

00:03:15.497 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you one, just
one strange example.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.746 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you
like that person?

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: I didn't like
that person at first,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:10%
because I always thought
of the people that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:10%
stopped to smell the roses as
the unambitious, lazy people

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.704 align:middle line:10%
that I was trying to
be different from.

00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're
the smart people.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: They are,
and I realized that.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:10%
But here I was, a guy that
never had any time to work out.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, going to the
gym for two hours a day.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Swimming laps, lifting weights,
running on the treadmill.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm a guy that's sitting
down and starting a diary,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and starting to read not
just my Bible every day,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
but also different influential
thinkers like Wayne Dyer,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and other people as well.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And starting to really
think about things

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in a whole different context
than what I thought about.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.895 align:middle line:90%
So it was a journey, George.

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
It took five years.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'll also tell
you that counseling

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:90%
was important as well.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
I went in counseling.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning it was every
week, I went for an hour.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:10%
Then it lessened
to once a month,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:10%
then it lessened to
once every three months.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And I've shared that with
people in my seminars as well.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And one man came up
to me, shared with me

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.056 align:middle line:10%
that his brother had
committed suicide.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And that it was
his older brother

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that he looked up
to his whole life.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, man,
I've got to admire you

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that you humbled yourself and
went to counseling instead

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of committing suicide.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, we tried
everything to get my brother

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to go to counseling so that he
wouldn't end up at this point.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't listen,
ended up killing himself.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
man, I could have been there.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people could be
talking about me today

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.895 align:middle line:90%
in the past tense.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
that every morning

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
when I wake up, that
I was that close.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I was that close.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:10%
And when I see all
of the blessings

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:10%
I have today, seeing my kids
graduating from college,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:10%
being able to buy a house
without a mortgage, all

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:10%
of these blessings, George,
that I would have missed out on.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:10%
This is the greatest
act of my life.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.924 align:middle line:10%
And I would have ended the
story so dark and despondent.

00:05:16.924 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And would have
missed all of this.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And so my message
to people is, man,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the greatest chapter
is yet to be written.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're down
right now, but this

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.465 align:middle line:84%
is like "Rocky I."
"Rocky II" is coming,

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
win the next fight.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.361 align:middle line:90%
And three, and four.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: That's
right, that's right.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
There's so much brighter
days ahead for you.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even during
your darkest moment,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:90%
it's going to get better.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: And George, you
know, it's so hard for people

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:10%
to believe this.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.846 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't know if you've
ever dealt with depression,

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:10%
but depression is a
serious, serious illness.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
completely unrelated

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:90%
from your circumstances.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
In my case, it was directly
related to my circumstance.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:10%
People like Marie
Osmond, she shares

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:10%
the story of her depression.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so many celebrities can
share-- and I can tell you,

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.115 align:middle line:84%
there is a point in depression,
George, where you literally

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
are in so much pain emotionally,
that you don't want to live.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You literally are--
it's like every breath

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.574 align:middle line:84%
is taking everything you have
to breathe that next breath.

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have no energy.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.448 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing.

00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:10%
But you have to pull
yourself out of that.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:10%
When you wrote the book, "How to
Pray for a Financial Miracle,"

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:10%
tell me what you
wanted people who

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.344 align:middle line:10%
read that book to
come away with.

00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well
George, that title's

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
a little bit provocative.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get some weird
emails from people

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that will say, this
can't be a godly book,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
you're writing about
praying to God for money.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.964 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your god is greed.

00:06:43.964 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Right, right.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I talk about
the bag of money prayer, which

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is what I consider to be
sort of the lowest form.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:90%
The laziest prayer.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is, God, I need
$1,000 by Friday.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And you just expect to
maybe wake up one morning,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.482 align:middle line:84%
and there's a bag of money
sitting on your kitchen table,

00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
or on your front porch, with
a note that says, here's

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
the money.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for asking,
and here you go.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Signed, God.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- I start--

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
quite happen that way.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah,
here's how the prayer

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:90%
system works that I developed.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
It's an 11 step process.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to be thankful
and grateful for everything

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why this is, I
could speculate for hours.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you approach God with a
grateful heart, it does really,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it does a
couple of things.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it lets him
know that you get it.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
All of the stuff that
he's done for you already.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
As I say in the
book, I don't care

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
what your financial
situation is.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
A multimillionaire
with six months to live

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that has a terminal
cancer diagnosis

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
would change places
with you in a heartbeat.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling down, go
visit a children's cancer ward

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%
in your local hospital.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Many times we over magnify
what our problems are.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So step one is being
grateful, being thankful.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:90%
This is biblical.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It also just makes
a lot of sense

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and take
an inventory of, hey,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.086 align:middle line:90%
I've still got my health.

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I've still got my marriage.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:10%
I've still got my family.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.672 align:middle line:10%
I've still got my mind.

00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I've lost all my money, but--

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.921 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've got myself.

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Like my counselor told
me, he says, look, he said,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:10%
you're not-- you're obviously
a very intelligent guy.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.235 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got to this--
written all these books, been

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.193 align:middle line:84%
on all these TV shows,
you made all this money.

00:08:23.193 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You think you're not going to
be able to go back and find

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
something else to do, or
some variation of what

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
you're-- and you know, it really
is interesting how you look

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
at yourself in the most
pessimistic perspective.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is to say to God,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
look, what have I done to
contribute to this mess?

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And take some ownership there.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
that's important.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.982 align:middle line:84%
For you to realize maybe,
look, I didn't have a budget.

00:08:45.982 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I was spending more
than I had coming in.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I was living on credit cards.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I quit my job before
I found a new one.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.235 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
things that we do.

00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We reap what
we sow, don't we?

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.715 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: We do.

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And then to ask God, what are
you trying to teach me in this?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a lesson
in so many things.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe there's
a lesson in why

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
you're going through what
you're going through.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And I also get into a lot
about, George, being open,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
going in these
prayer sessions where

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
you spend two hours with a
yellow pad, and you say to God,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to listen.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to talk and be
giving all my requests to you

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:90%
like you're Santa Claus.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to listen.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.893 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what I need to do.

00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:27.996 align:middle line:84%
Give me wisdom, God,
and tell me what to do.

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I come back from these
prayer sessions, George,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
with seven or eight
pages of notes

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:84%
on my yellow pad
of things, ideas.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends, he
never went to college,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and he laughed when
he told me this story.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
He decided in his mid
30s to go to college.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the local
community college,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
signs up for an 18
month course to become

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:90%
a respiratory therapist.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:10%
Now this guy, he's
got tattoos all over,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:10%
and you'd never think of
him as a hospital worker.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:10%
So he goes, and he
graduates, does very well.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
He laughed when he
told me, he says,

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Jim, I make more money than
most of the doctors do.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I walk around the hospital
with a white doctor's coat on,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:90%
lab coat on, and a stethoscope.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.729 align:middle line:90%
And people think I'm a doctor.

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just a
respiratory therapist.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.686 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know what,
he said, in a couple of years,

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be starting
my own oxygen delivery,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.676 align:middle line:84%
where I go to people's
homes and provide

00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:90%
this therapy in their home.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be making
double what I already make now.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:90%
And he did this in 18 months.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I point out in
the book that, look,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
there's parts of the Dakotas
that have 0% unemployment.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you don't want
to get in the oil business.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
You could get retrained
to do something.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%
But look, they need teachers.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.992 align:middle line:90%
They need service workers.

00:10:39.992 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:90%
They need people to cut hair.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.535 align:middle line:90%
They need police officers.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was smart
enough to realize.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah, so
you find a way.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.472 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're a salesman, and
you're selling real estate.

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the real estate
market has collapsed.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might think,
well, I'll go kill myself.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.044 align:middle line:84%
Or, maybe you'll start
selling medical equipment.

00:10:56.044 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
the money is today.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.244 align:middle line:84%
So there is a plan out there
for you, and in this world

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in
where things are changing

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
so quickly, George,
people have to many times

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.402 align:middle line:90%
reinvent themselves.

00:11:06.402 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I read an article the
other day that said

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
the average adult
in their career

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
will probably go in five
different directions.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
You'll have five completely
different careers

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:90%
over your adult working years.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when one of
these chapters closes,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
all this means is
that you've got

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to look for the next
chapter to start.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I got a flyer a couple of
weeks ago in my mailbox.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Our community, our
local adult education,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
is offering for $2,000,
George, you can go at night.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Two or three nights a
week, for 2,000 bucks,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:10%
and you can get certified to
be a network internet security

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:10%
expert.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Get this credential for $2,000.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:10%
I thought to myself, man,
a guy could go and do

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:10%
that a couple of nights a
week, and with all this hacking

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:10%
that's going on, and what
happened with Target,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:10%
and all of this stuff--

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I know, it's
going to be huge.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: You come out with
a credential like that

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.444 align:middle line:84%
for a couple thousand
dollars, and now you're

00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:03.244 align:middle line:90%
a network security guy.

00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A company
would hire you.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: You-- absolutely.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
If not, you could
be a consultant,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
probably flying
all over the world.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
new opportunities.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
As much as we-- you know I was
sad, my bookstore in Palm Coast

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.314 align:middle line:90%
closed this last week.

00:12:17.314 --> 00:12:18.605 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a tough business.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.479 align:middle line:10%
Bookstores are tough.

00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: But you know what,
the bookstores are closing,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:10%
but now we have the
Kindle, and ebooks,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:10%
and now this is like a whole
new opportunity for writers

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:10%
to be able to start writing
books that could be ebooks.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
are still reading.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: So I know it
sounds like a trite saying,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.385 align:middle line:84%
but for every door that
closes, another door

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:90%
is opening somewhere.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
be open to seeing

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that there are opportunities
out there for everybody.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is erasing negativity

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
from what you want to do?

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Case in point, my
mother always used

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to tell me a story
that I'm going

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.227 align:middle line:84%
to remember for the
rest of my life.

00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's very short.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
just, life itself.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And she basically
said, and it was

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
about an individual,
who said, "I

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
cried because I had
no shoes, until I

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:90%
saw a man with no feet."

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And that tells it--
that's everything.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.671 align:middle line:90%
You know it?

00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.128 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, George, you
know, every day when we wake up,

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
conscious choice

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to make whether we want to
look in the rear view mirror

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:90%
or look out the windshield.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.939 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've
always believed this,

00:13:23.939 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's something
that I've learned,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that I can't control what's
going to happen in the future.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I have no control over that.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.494 align:middle line:84%
As much as I can plan,
I don't have a control.

00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a control over
what's already happened to me.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
That's already happened.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless one
of your other guests

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
can figure out
time travel, and we

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:90%
can go back and fix the past.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're working on it.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: I know we are.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But all I can do is
control the present moment.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:10%
As much as in one
way George, there's

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:10%
sort of an uneasiness
about that,

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:10%
it's like, this is all
that I have control over

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:10%
is this moment.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But there is a peace
that you can enter into,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can sit in an
airport and be frustrated

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that your plane is
late, or this has

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
happened with your
car, or this--

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.614 align:middle line:84%
or you can sit there and say,
man, what's going on around me?

00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking around me.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's someone here that
just got a cancer diagnosis.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's somebody
here that just

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
lost their house to foreclosure.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these
people around me.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I start praying for
people that are around me.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.091 align:middle line:84%
And I start thinking about
the blessings that I have.

00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, maybe there's
a good little coffee

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
shop I can find,
or a book that I'm

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
going to find in a
bookstore in here.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
living like that,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:90%
your whole life will change.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at every
moment as just an opportunity

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to just rest in God, and
realize that you can't control

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.582 align:middle line:84%
the future, you can't
control the past.

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
All you have is
the present moment.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
prayer mean to you?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And what is prayer?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well George, I'll tell
you that for a lot of years

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't pray at all.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I was like, sort of--

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
doesn't mean religious.

00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:55.869 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: No, no, no.

00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:56.368 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:56.368 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.521 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've said
this on your show,

00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a big
critic of religion.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I think religion is in
many ways a scam that

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:90%
is used to control people.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:90%
To get their money.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about a
relationship with God,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
which has nothing
to do with religion.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Although religion would
try to own that, it's not.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking about
when I talk about prayer,

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and as a kid, I grew up,
you pray at your meal,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:90%
thank you, God, for my meal.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:90%
You pray at bedtime.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of prayers.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.946 align:middle line:84%
But as I became an
adult, I started to pray.

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
how I prayed, George.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Is I would come up with my own
plans, and I would go to God.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
God, bless my plan.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
That was my prayer.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I realize now, I can
laugh, how foolish that was.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
That here I was, asking
God to enter into my plan

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
instead of entering
into his plan,

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and asking him what is
your plan for my life?

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I prayed.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I also prayed, and prayer
to me was like a broadcast.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:84%
They say the internet
is now social media 2.0,

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:90%
it's a conversation.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, you post
something on the internet,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.265 align:middle line:90%
but people talk back to you.

00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:10%
Well hey, this is prayer
2.0 for Jim Paris.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:10%
This is the idea that, I pray
in a way where I shut my mouth,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:10%
and quiet my mind.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I say to God, what do you
want to tell me right now?

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I bring an empty pad
of paper, which in the book

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I give people--

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.993 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
Neale Donald Walsh,

00:16:22.993 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
when he wrote
"Conversations with God."

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Where all he did,
he slept in his car.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.806 align:middle line:84%
And he sketched things
and wrote things.

00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: And I tell people,
when you go into these prayer

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
sessions, George, don't question
anything that comes to mind.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
There will be times later
to pray about those things

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
again and refine those ideas.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But I would come out of
these prayer sessions

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
where it would just be me
saying, God, this is Jim.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to tell me?

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'd have that pen ready.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would just wait and
listen for the voice of God,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas and
the information

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that I got in those
prayer sessions.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I would come, seven,
eight pages of things

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.889 align:middle line:90%
that I had written down.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I still have many of
those yellow pads today.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:84%
And I just think to myself, what
if I had started listening--

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.951 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: So much younger.

00:17:11.951 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Where would I be today?

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that God,
the God of the universe

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
wants to actually
communicate with us,

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
this is such a foreign
concept to people,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
that it actually scares them.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I've had people send me
emails after they've heard me

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
on your radio program
and other programs,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
where they've gone into a
prayer session like this,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and they said that for the
first time in their life,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
they felt the presence
of God, and they

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
felt this communication
happening,

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and it literally scared them.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they had never had
that experience before.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time
that that happened to me.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It literally brought
me almost to my knees,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
when you feel the
presence of God,

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.609 align:middle line:84%
and that God does want
to communicate with us.

00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
book is all about.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not about praying for a
mystical, magical bag of money

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:90%
to appear.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's about asking for
God's will in your life.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying,
God, this is my plan.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.026 align:middle line:90%
Bless my plan.

00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Going in and saying, God,
what is your plan for me?

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Because really the truth
is that God's will is

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
what we would want to have
happen if we knew everything

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.109 align:middle line:90%
he knows.

00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
everything that's going

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:90%
to happen to us in the future.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that information.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that if we knew
everything that God knows,

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that what is happening
to us right now

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.555 align:middle line:84%
is what we would actually design
to happen to us right now.

00:18:35.555 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
all that information.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's about seeking
God's will, George.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Being open to hearing
what he has to say.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is,
you know, be willing to move.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:90%
What if God says, move.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was in
Pittsburgh a few years ago,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
when all of the oil-- or the
steel industry was collapsing,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.192 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking
to a cab driver.

00:18:58.192 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you're
telling me how bad it was.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.702 align:middle line:84%
I said, why don't people move
from Pittsburgh if it's so bad?

00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around,
and he looked at me

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:90%
with the strangest look.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, people don't
move from Pittsburgh.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:10%
If you're born in Pittsburgh,
you stay in Pittsburgh.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to myself
man, this country

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:10%
was based on rugged
individualism.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we would pack up the
whole family in a covered wagon

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:10%
without there even being roads.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And you'd just go
through the forest

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to get to the other side.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
People being willing
to change careers,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
people being
willing to downsize.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.079 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't make as
much money as I used to.

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you happier?

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: I'm happier,
but you know what?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:10%
I don't need the money
that I used to make.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I live a debt free life.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I have a nice little sailboat.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I go to my martial arts classes
about five over six hours

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I, we go out to
dinner a couple of nights

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I've got two dogs that I
spend a lot of time jogging

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:90%
with in the neighborhood.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't take a lot--

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're at peace.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: It doesn't take a
lot to really be satisfied.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:10%
And many times, we're
like that proverbial mouse

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.812 align:middle line:10%
that's on the treadmill,
chasing that piece of cheese--

00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Going nowhere.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.728 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: But George, I
got the piece of cheese.

00:20:11.728 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:10%
I bit into it.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.435 align:middle line:10%
I didn't like it.

00:20:13.435 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And then someone stole the
piece of cheese from me,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and now I realize I don't really
want that piece of cheese again

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's more
to life than the cheese.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.155 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: It is.

00:20:21.155 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And everybody's going to have
a different take on this,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:10%
but the book is very nuanced.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:10%
You know, when you say, how to
pray for a financial miracle,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:10%
it's going to draw in a lot
of different kinds of people

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:10%
that will grab a book like this.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that I
hear from people overall

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
is they just can't believe the
stories of what happened to me.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
going from a guy that

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
was ready to commit
suicide to a guy that

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
was able to go to
a closing and buy

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.885 align:middle line:84%
a house with no mortgage,
that's a journey.

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a journey.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: And that's my story.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great journey.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Who's the person that we
used to watch on late night

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
television who was selling
these little tiny ads

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:90%
in the newspaper to make money?

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:90%
He ended up being arrested.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:90%
He committed suicide.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Don Lapre.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.296 align:middle line:90%
I liked that guy.

00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: I really did, too.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I bought some of his
stuff too, because--

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I did too, as a
kid, or a younger person.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, I want that.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: I thought
it was interesting.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What goes
through somebody?

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Because his empire
collapsed, much like yours,

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:90%
but he finished it.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well you know,
when people go to prison--

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
in bankruptcy court,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
there was a man that you
have to go up to the judge

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and explain to the trustee why
you're filing for bankruptcy.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Sort of a formality.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But a man went before
me, and he was probably

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
in his early '80s, George.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was steadied
on either side

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
by what appeared to
be his adult children.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And he could hardly walk, and
he was crying so profusely,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
sobbing, and he
says to the trustee,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:84%
he says, I'm so
ashamed to be here.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I've never believed
in bankruptcy.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
save my mobile home,

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
because of my medical bills, I
have no choice but to do this.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was a guy that
went two before me.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, man.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
back to Don Lapre.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
When you're sentenced to
federal prison, and people--

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people commit suicide
before going to prison.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
that go to prison,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and everything they
imagine prison would

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:90%
be, it turns out not to be that.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they go there, they
get another college degree,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:90%
they make new friends.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They've now got some fantastic
story to write a book about.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And many of these people
come out of prison,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're a bigger hit than
before they went to prison.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:10%
Look at Martha Stewart.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:10%
So again, the story really
is that your perception

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:10%
at the moment is,
this is the end.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may even
be the beginning.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.961 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: It very well could be.

00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my counselor, he said
to me, one thing that really

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:84%
changed my life,
in fact, we were

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.465 align:middle line:90%
talking about Bill Clinton.

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
me, he says, think

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.173 align:middle line:90%
about Bill Clinton for a moment.

00:23:06.173 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
He's caught in this
big sexual scandal,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:84%
here he is, the President
of the United States.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Embarrassing.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: You couldn't
be-- the word

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:10%
couldn't have gotten out
any-- worldwide, you're on TV.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:10%
I did not have sex
with that-- he says,

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:10%
look at what he went through.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But he could choose to
interpret that one of two ways.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:90%
He could say, my life is over.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I need to resign
from the presidency,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and to become a
recluse, and to just

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
live in obscurity for
the rest of my life.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Some men may have
made that choice.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.217 align:middle line:90%
He said, well--

00:23:37.217 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like it
didn't even phase him.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.591 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: It's an
event that happened,

00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll do my best
damage control, I'm

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
not going to resign
from the presidency.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And he's now one of the
most popular figures

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:90%
in American culture.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's making
millions on speeches.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: And books.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And people don't even
remember that whole episode

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
to a large degree.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So, the meaning, George, that
we assign to these events

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
is not right in the moment
when you're looking at it,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
saying, the guy's in the
driveway right now repossessing

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.429 align:middle line:90%
my car.

00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be any lower.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm standing here in bankruptcy.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
They're coming to
evict me from my house.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's-- my house is
being foreclosed.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:84%
My wife is leaving me because
our finances have collapsed.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, you're going
to define that moment in a way

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:90%
that my life is over.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no point in living.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that it is not
only far less dark than what

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing right
there, but here's

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the amazing thing about it.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of a weird,
amazing opportunity that

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is a part of that
car being taken away.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.917 align:middle line:84%
You're probably going to
find-- if you pray about this,

00:24:43.917 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and have the right
attitude, you're probably

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:84%
going to end up in a
better car with a lower

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
payment or no
payments, if you allow

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
those circumstances
to unravel, and you

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
deal with that in
a positive way.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've learned,
which is so amazing.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize that no
matter what happens to me,

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I can choose to interpret
that one of two ways.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:10%
I could put a negative spin on
it, or a positive spin on it.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Man, if God is with me
in this, I don't care.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to prison.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to the-- I'll go to
the gates of hell if I have to,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:90%
if God is with me.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And something-- I mean, if I
ended up at the gates of hell,

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I could come back from that and
write one helluva book right?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would probably
be turned into a movie.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
What's the main message you want
people to get from your book,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
"How to Pray for a
Financial Miracle."

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: The main
message is this.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
That no matter how desperate
your financial circumstances

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:90%
are, there is a way out.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And God will give you
wisdom if you ask for it.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
George, he will give
you a specific plan.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're open
to it, he'll give you

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of ideas and
directions to go in.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're simply open to
this, and you seek him.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
God is the last place, he's
the last person we go to.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We call up everybody
to borrow money.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.229 align:middle line:90%
We start buying self help books.

00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We're doing all
these different kinds

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
of things trying to
figure it out on our own,

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and we wait until it gets
to the absolute worst

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:90%
moment, like I did.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Well you know what, I'm
going to kill myself.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll turn to God.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And my advice to
people is, no matter

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:10%
how bad it gets financially,
George, turn to God now.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.045 align:middle line:10%
Don't wait until you get
down to the last dollar

00:26:25.045 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:10%
or the last penny.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:10%
Turn to God now.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:10%
And accept the
fact that no matter

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:10%
how bad it is, that he can
turn it all into a positive.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
start embracing all this stuff,

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:90%
it almost becomes funny.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, I'm foreclosed
out of my house.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
The next day I move
into a bigger house.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I was crying until
I started laughing.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.092 align:middle line:90%
And to see--

00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's almost comical.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: How God is
there taking care of us,

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.054 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even recognize
it when it's happening.

00:26:55.054 --> 00:26:56.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks
for your advice.

00:26:56.595 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Thank you so much, sir.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.788 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Pleasure to be here.

00:26:59.788 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
we all as human beings

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:10%
will go through this
dark side of our life.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:10%
The secret is to pull
yourself from that abyss

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:10%
and wait for a brighter day.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank
you for watching us here

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.720 align:middle line:90%
