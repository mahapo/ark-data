>>GEORGE NOORY: I am
really looking forward

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:10%
to this edition of
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
Antonio Arilo is with us, a
spiritual mentor and guide.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, his mission is to integrate
spiritual principles and tools

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
into society to access
higher dimensional energies

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and optimize the way we live.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Antonio, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTONIO ARILO: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
a little bit more

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
about yourself and
your background.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: All right.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
So I was born in New York.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
My mother is from
Dominican Republic.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
My father is from Puerto
Rico, so mixed with that.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:10%
So I was raised in Saint Croix.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:10%
That's the Virgin Islands--

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:10%
Saint Croix, Saint Thomas,
and Saint John in Saint Croix.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Then I came to Miami in 1996,
went through my school years,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:90%
was raised in the church--

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.465 align:middle line:84%
Christian Pentecostal
to be more exact.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: And so that
was my first entry

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
into any kind of spirituality,
religion, things like that.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And then after spending
about maybe 10 years

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:10%
within the church
structure, I entered

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:10%
into the spiritual community,
the online spiritual community,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:10%
through Facebook.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And there I met a
lot of people that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:90%
were very spiritually gifted.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And they helped initiate
me into perceiving

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
reality outside of the
religious structure or just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
out of the box, just out of
the matrix, reality period.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a really
big initiation for me.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it just evolved
into me developing

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
my own spiritual abilities,
my own psychic abilities,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
being able to access
spiritual information even

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
about myself,
about other people,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
about how reality works,
and things like that.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it branched off into
me developing and creating

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
services and courses
and things like that.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got into it in
a big way once you started.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yes, I did.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
sun consciousness?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Sun
consciousness represents--

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
it's just like when people
say Christ consciousness.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of
Christ consciousness,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's more of a
universal consciousness,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
bringing many different
consciousness that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
are here on Earth to
help humanity evolve.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of an over
encompassing consciousness

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that bridges the gap between
many different layers

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.985 align:middle line:90%
of understandings.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made
you decide you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be a spiritual coach?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: I've
always had a desire

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to help people and
serve the collective.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And so once I started
practicing doing energy work--

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
very simple Reiki sending
energy kind of thing--

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I
had a gift for it.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It just came very natural to me.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.028 align:middle line:84%
And when I began helping people
and assisting them and just

00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
hearing the feedback that
people were giving me-- very,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:90%
very positive--

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
it struck something within me.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And I told myself, I
really, really would

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:90%
like to get more into this.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And it just evolved over
time into me creating

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:90%
many different services.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it just brings
a lot of joy to me

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.425 align:middle line:84%
to really serve people
in a spiritual way.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you've
helped a lot of people.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And your clients think
the world of you.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yes.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.562 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's important
for you to know that.

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Accessing these
higher dimensions.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Was it easy for
you, or is it hard?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Well, my first official
breakthrough was in 2015

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
when I was meditating.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It was very intense meditation.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like my consciousness
hit some kind of ceiling.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And as I focused harder, I felt
like I broke through something,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I just felt this
huge expansion in my head.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I just felt this energy.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
This flow of energy just started
rushing all throughout me.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I started
to connect more,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I started to receive the
messages that I broke through

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:90%
into higher dimensions.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, whoa, because,
at the time, all I understood

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:90%
was 5D stuff.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I was receiving
from my spiritual guidance

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is that I broke through, and I
was in the seventh dimension.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.598 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: And then
I started to go

00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
even higher because I was
like, wait, if I can go here,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I can go higher.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to always test
myself to see how far I can go,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
what I can handle,
and things like that.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So I broke through higher.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And I started to understand the
ways the dimensions operated

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and the precautions that
I had to take in order

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
to navigate them safely
because there is always

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
good and bad within
these dimensional planes.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And it just--

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Depends
on how it's used.

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yes, it depends
on your intentions

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're accessing those
dimensions, of course.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is Draco tech?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Draco technology is
fourth dimensional cybernetic

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
implants that the
Dracos themselves

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
have used to plug people into
certain cybernetic structures.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So these structures have
been in place for, I mean,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years, ever
since the Dracos have

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
taken over this solar system,
even though that's not

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:90%
the case anymore.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But in the past, when
the planetary energy

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
was in a much lower,
heavier state,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of these
huge infrastructures,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
these cybernetic infrastructures
that plugged people

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
into a false reality.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not good, is it?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: No.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So what I have come to
understand is that Draco tech--

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:84%
it is implanted on
people to hinder them

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
from awakening to who they are,
hinders them from perceiving

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
reality for what it
really is, and makes

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
them perceive themselves
small, other people small.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It can hinder you in just
about every way possible.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Antonio, who puts this
Draco tech within somebody?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So there used to be
some kind of funnel installed

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
within the fourth
dimension as well.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
When many souls
would incarnate, they

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:90%
had to go through this funnel.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And they got Draco tech
implanted on them depending

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
on who they are because
everyone's soul signature is

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's mission is different.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So there were
specific Draco tech

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that were installed
within certain souls that

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
carried certain codes to
run a particular mission.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was to hinder them
in a very particular way.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you detect
it on your clients?

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Well, I basically
just tune into their energy.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's first
with my intentions.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I just project the intention
that I want to tune

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
into that specific
layer of energy,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I can just
see it on people.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it can be in any
part of the body.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say a picture's
worth a thousand words.

00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: [LAUGHS]

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at how you

00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
do some of what you just said.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
- So what I am seeing right
now is this piece of-- it looks

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
like a disk, a metal disk
that's almost like it's trying

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:90%
to reach your heart area.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.185 align:middle line:90%
But it's outside of your heart.

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It's outside of your field.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
there, but it's outside.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is trying
to cause self-doubt.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to cause questioning
yourself, questioning reality,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
not trusting yourself.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
There is this
element of where it's

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to make you feel small or
trying to make you stay small.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's also affecting
the perception,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
trying to make you feel small.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But your energy is
nothing like that.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
You have a very
expansive energy.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But I can see that
you're also stepping

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper, more powerful
version of who you are.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an
initiation process that's

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:90%
going on with you right now.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel
that this thing is

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to put you back in
this limited self perception.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of
the things that I see.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm going
to move it on to you.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.512 align:middle line:84%
And just let me know what you
can perceive with yourself

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
- So as soon as we
started talking about it,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:84%
I actually perceived
something in my eye.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:90%
- The third eye?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a technology
that comes through as--

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that limits my
perception of reality.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:90%
- Reality?

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm looking
at that right now.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
I find a lot of times

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
with people where it either
blocks, hinders, or distorts

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:84%
spiritual perception-- not
just spiritual perception,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
but just your
perception on yourself.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It could be on a human level,
emotional, mental, et cetera.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.532 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely
affects the spiritual.

00:09:20.532 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now I'm going to
begin removing these things.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Just tune in and
focus on my energy

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention
to how I'm removing

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
everything and the steps
that I take, et cetera.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.892 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
- I just felt a load
lifted off my chest.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you pushed away whatever
was in front of my heart space.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It's been pushed
away, and it's gone.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel lighter,
like I can breathe.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like my
third eye is pouring out.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:84%
There's light pouring
out of my third eye.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I just feel so much lighter.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:90%

to push that away from her?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So I use
various spiritual tools.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be a blowtorch.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.775 align:middle line:90%
It could be some pliers.

00:10:12.775 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A blowtorch?

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Sometimes.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] These energetic
little blowtorches

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that I use to cut or
to burn something off

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of people because some tech
is thicker than others.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And they require different tools
to either cut, burn, or just

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:90%
remove in different ways.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I also have an energetic
sack that I use

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:90%
or a bag, a trash bag basically.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.773 align:middle line:84%
And it uses black
hole technology

00:10:38.773 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
where it just opens
a little black hole,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and I just put it in.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:90%

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
consciousness traps?

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: A consciousness
trap is a perception

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
like if somebody is giving
spiritual perspectives, right?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is a perspective
that traps people's

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
thinking or traps people's
mind into a way of thinking

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that is not conducive to
their spiritual growth.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.517 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that happen a lot?

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: It happens a lot.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I see it very, very frequently.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that I
try to address in the best way

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that I can to help
people understand how

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to spot these things and
how to prevent themselves

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
from falling into these
consciousness traps

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
because these consciousness
traps are intended

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
to limit people's ability
to connect with themselves

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and to limit their own
perception of reality.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people get
themselves trapped on

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:90%
their own or outside forces?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It could be
from outside forces,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
like outside
spiritual influences,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
but also with many
people that they follow--

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
reading perspectives,
reading all kinds of content,

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
ingesting video content,
written content, reading books.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
These consciousness
traps are everywhere.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always intentional.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people who are I guess
sharing perspectives that

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
may have a little bit of
distorted perspectives to them

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.622 align:middle line:90%
can trap people.

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people have
very good intentions,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
but they may not always
understand everything

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that they are sharing
or how harmful some

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:90%
of those perspectives can be.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the people
ingesting that content--

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
because when you ingest
someone's information,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
it's not just information.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting you on
some level subconsciously.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you safely
navigate these people, Antonio,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
through this mess?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: So what I do is--

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
a big thing that I try to
teach is spiritual discernment,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:84%
how to discern
information especially

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
age of information.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
This is the age of disclosure.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge hunger for
the truth, for knowledge.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And so with that
comes a lot of traps.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what I try to
instill in my audience

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and my clients is
to really learn

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
how to discern and
take the time to really

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
integrate on a personal level
the information that they're

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:90%
ingesting.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, creating their
own spiritual practices,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
their own meditations,
and things like that.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
or the practices

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that will create
the space for people

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to really digest the information
that they're ingesting properly

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
so they can separate what
is good and what is bad.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's a
big separation, isn't it?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.222 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yeah, because
what I find a lot of times

00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is there's a lot of
information overload.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And people are ingesting so much
information, so much content.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
developing the practices

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
within their own personal lives
in order to really process

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just stuck up here.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's just full
of good and bad.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's just-- yeah.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear a
lot about the matrix.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
What are matrix grids?

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So the matrix
grids are layers.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like mechanisms
that manage our reality.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, our
reality is comprised

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of many different layers.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But a matrix itself is basically
a geometric crystalline--

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
so if you can imagine
a platonic solid,

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:90%
and it could be any shape.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.227 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a
crystalline matrix.

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of
crystalline energies.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And within it, it can
either contain a planet,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.303 align:middle line:90%
a solar system, a galaxy--

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:30.136 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.637 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: --and so
forth and so on.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different sizes and layers

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to these matrix structures,
and each of them

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:90%
have their own grid system.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And so these grid systems
are different colors.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
They affect different
aspects of reality.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They basically manage the
ecosystem of our reality.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
in other dimensions?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.352 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: They are in
other dimensions, yes.

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
They are multidimensional
grid systems as well.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
crystalline matrix.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
What creates that?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So the
crystalline matrix

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most advanced
spiritual technologies that

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:90%
have been created.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
They are created from
many of the higher

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
creation beings.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
This could either be
the creator dragons

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
or other beings that
are very, very high

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.787 align:middle line:84%
level that create the
structures of these things.

00:15:27.787 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
what has been one of the most
gratifying things you've done?

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Well, I
really just enjoy--

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
tell you enjoy this.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yeah, this is
one of my biggest passions

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is to help people in
whatever way is needed,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
whether they need a clearing
or enlightening people

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
on certain perspectives
or helping them

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:90%
connect with themselves deeper.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
biggest passions

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is to helping people connect
with their own multidimensional

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
selves and just seeing the
illumination in their face

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and in their voice when they're
actually making that connection

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and putting certain puzzle
pieces of themselves together.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:90%
That's very gratifying for me.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you put them back,
Antonio, on the right path?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So what I do
is I try to align people

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%
with their own path.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And I do that
through mentorship,

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
through these
clearings that I do

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of these things
that are on their energies,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
it redirects
people's trajectories

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and gets them into
things, whether it's

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
consciousness traps or
distractions or other things

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that will distract them and take
them away off the path of where

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:90%
they need to align themselves.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do, I just come
along either with mentorship

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is needed to
redirect their focus where

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:90%
they need to go.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these matrices
good things or bad things?

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So these matrices,
originally they are good.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They are created
to basically manage

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the many different
layers of reality.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, many of
them have been hijacked.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.384 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By?

00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: By malevolent
artificial intelligence.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
When we get into
more intelligence,

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence,
there's been a concern

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
take over the planet.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Are you concerned about that?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Not at all, because
that is not what the higher

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:90%
timeline is indicating.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
This is more of
a lower timeline.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a projection from the
artificial intelligence itself

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
where it wants as much of
the collective as possible

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to align their consciousness
with that reality

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:90%
so that we can manifest it.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.305 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the timeline
that we're on at all.

00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the complete opposite.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that doesn't
concern you at this time.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Not at all.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not concerned.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many other
planets in our solar system

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
are affected by this?

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So each planet has
its own matrix structure

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
with its own grid systems that
affect the multiple realities

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
of that specific planet.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
all connected?

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: They are all connected.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So if one matrix system
of a certain planet

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
is negatively
impacted, it's going

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
to impact the grid systems and
the matrix of another planet

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:90%
to some capacity.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know when
you school a client that you're

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:90%
schooling them the right way?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Well, what
I do is I align them.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I call forward
their higher self.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I call forward the
galactic elements

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that they are
connected to so we have

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
a whole group of spiritual
and intergalactic beings

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:90%
that are there present.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
lot of confirmation

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and just a lot of
alignment that's there.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever gotten to
a situation where you thought,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a little deep?

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I'm going
to get out of this thing.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ARILO: So the way I navigate
this reality is I am always

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:10%
connected with my
higher self at all times

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and my spiritual team
and my galactic team.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:10%
So every time I am stepping
into a particular territory

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:10%
frequency-wise,
there is precautions

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:10%
that I take all the time.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm stepping
into something new,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I stop and discern
what this thing is

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and how I can navigate it
the safest way possible.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How spiritual
are we as human beings?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Spiritual?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I can say that there is
a big awakening happening

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
right now within the
collective consciousness.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.092 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like there--

00:19:29.092 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.758 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: That is
a very good thing.

00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:36.208 align:middle line:84%
More people are becoming
more aware of our reality

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
in many different layers.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is on
their own journey,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:84%
but there is a huge awakening
happening on so many levels.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
People are awakening to
their own past lives,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
their own multidimensional
avatars that

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:90%
are existing parallel to them.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
layers of reality

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
that people are awakening to.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
is fueling this awakening?

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: What's fueling this
awakening is the restoration

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of the matrix of this planet.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So there has been a lot
of work done throughout--

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the past five
years, there's been

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work being
done on the matrix

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:90%
to restore the grid systems.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And since the grid
systems affect reality,

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
these grids have been--

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
the mechanisms of them
have been initiating people

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:90%
into this awakening.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's been bringing in these new
energies that's been awakening

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:90%
people on different levels.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia, Mother
Earth, is what we live on.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Does this affect the planet in
the right way or the wrong way

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:90%
if it's done not correctly?

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So Gaia is one of
the biggest tools of ascension

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
right now that I guess you
could say the universe is

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:90%
using to awaken the collective.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's an incredible
force for good right now.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there
are elements of it

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that I feel that over time will
readjust and shift according

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to the many different energies
that are coming through

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
for humanity because with these
different layers of energies,

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a need for
new content and new information

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and new things to
be brought forward.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And so Gaia is at
the forefront of that

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
bringing these things forward.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anything
go wrong here, Antonio?

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Anything is
possible for sure, yeah.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like humanity is
in a particular frequency

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
right now where the
likelihood of that to happen

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:90%
is very, very low.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take me on a simple
course with what you do.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I come
to you as a client.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And I say, Mr. Arilo, I just
don't think I have it together.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm doing
things the right way.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm making a lot of
mistakes with my life.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing wrong?

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So the first
thing I do is identify

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual attachments that
they have on their energies

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
stuff that affects

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
their perception, their
self perception, how

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
they feel, how they operate, how
they take care of themselves.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing I address.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Then this could be negative
entities demonic entities

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
or Draco technology, or it could
be curses or just other things.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first thing
that I address in them.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we do a
clearing, and then we

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:90%
follow up with other sessions.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
higher self reading

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is what I do where I
channel information

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:84%
from their own higher self
about the multidimensional

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
connections they have, the
galactic connections they have,

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
so that they can begin to
receive more perspective of who

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
they are, so they
can start stepping

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
into a more broader
understanding of what

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.683 align:middle line:90%
they're here to do.

00:22:59.683 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:90%
And that helps them overall.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there many
spiritual abilities

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:90%
available to all of us?

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yeah, so
on a base level,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.230 align:middle line:84%
we have our psychic abilities,
our clairvoyant abilities,

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:84%
our empathic abilities, and our
ability to connect with each

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:84%
other on a telepathic
level-- and that includes

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials as well--

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to channel
energy and do various forms

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:90%
of energetic work.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Antonio,
as we have talked

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
in the past about the DNA
activation, the ability

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to change the life spiritually,
you performed the DNA

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:90%
activation on a client.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at that, and then
you can tell us what you did.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
- First, we're going
to begin by pulling up

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the DNA strands that would like
to show themselves right now.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to go
ahead and do that.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Just pull them up and have
them lined up horizontally

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:90%
right in front of you.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:90%
They're in front of me.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This particular DNA
strand has to do

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
with the Pleiadian
connections that you have,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:90%
your Pleiadian family.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
your involvement

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
with many of the
things that you've

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
done, whether it's in the
SSP or just your Pleiadian

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional aspects
and your family coming

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
through with this
particular DNA strand.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And so activating it
further will help you

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
connect even deeper than
you've already been connecting

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:90%
with your Pleiadian roots.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.376 align:middle line:90%
So this is really interesting.

00:24:42.376 --> 00:24:43.176 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I'm just
going to ask you

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
for some feedback to
just let me know what

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:90%
it is that you are perceiving.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You can let me know
the other DNA strands

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:90%
if you feel so inclined.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
- So it makes a lot
of sense because I

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
feel like I've had a little bit
of trouble connecting deeper

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in with the
Pleiadian connection.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it just came
through, I don't know,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of weeks--

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
understanding more of that.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.428 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, it makes
perfect sense to me

00:25:15.428 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that this would come up
to activate now so that I

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:90%
can continue that connection.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's really cool that
was what you got from that.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:90%
- All right.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA, the way it looks
to me is the vibrancy of it

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
looks like it could be activated
further where it can vibrate

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
even louder, just
more pronounced,

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
the energy and the way that the
light is reflecting from it.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to allow
for better clarity when

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:84%
you do continue to connect
with your Pleiadian roots.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:10%
More of your Pleiadian
family is going

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:10%
to come through, especially if
you want to dive into the SSP

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:10%
connection.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That might want to come
through there as well.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And your involvement with doing
different things, especially

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
terraforming and
things like that--

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I can feel that that's a big
part of your Pleiadian roots

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.698 align:middle line:84%
amongst many other
things as well.

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that
information is going

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to come through a
lot more fluently.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:90%
- Wow.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
- So I'm going to do an
activation right now.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to send it through.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
give me some feedback

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
as to how that
looks energetically

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.857 align:middle line:90%
for you on your end.

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
- OK, so as I was
seeing it before,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like the bottom of
it was spinning in front of me,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
rotating.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom of it was
darker and almost like

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:84%
if you have a plant, and the
plant leaf is shriveled up

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and wilted.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:90%
It almost looked like that.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when you did the
activation, this burst of light

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%
hit the whole strand.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just started
vibrating differently,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of that darker
energy went away,

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and it just turned
almost iridescent.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And my head's tingling
as I'm talking.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%
My hands are tingling too.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So definitely feeling it
on the physical level too.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you know she
had a Pleiadian background?

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So when I am tuning
into people's DNA strands,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:84%
they are connected
to different things.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
their galactic roots

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
or any of their other
multidimensional roots.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
comes through.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I see-- sometimes
I see it in words.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I see "Pleiadian" in my head.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did her DNA need
a lot of patching up?

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So with that
one in particular,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
it was the light of
it was a little bit

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
dim because it was,
as she explained,

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:90%
some darker energies in there.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I needed to
do was do an activation

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:90%
where it illuminated it.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was just vibrating
in this crystalline energy.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And what that allowed was
for her to connect deeper

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:84%
with her own
Pleiadian roots to get

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
more of the information
and the clarity.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it does
normally for when I am

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:90%
addressing other DNAs as well.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say
that her case is pretty

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:90%
indicative of many cases?

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yeah.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So with her in particular,
she has certain connections,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:84%
especially with the SSP and
with other galactic groups.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that with
many other people as well.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it's never
really the same.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Every DNA session that I
do, it's always unique.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:90%
It's always unique.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
different element to it.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
doing the DNA activation,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:90%
exactly what does that mean?

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So the DNA is all
of our spiritual abilities,

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:84%
the connection to anything
that we could possibly

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
imagine-- spiritual,
multidimensional, galactic--

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:90%
is contained within the DNA.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there is the
more organic bodily functions

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of it too like the
blood and the bones

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and the cells and
stuff like that.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do
these DNA scans,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I basically just call
forward or have the client

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.585 align:middle line:84%
call forward their
multiple DNA strands,

00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
but only the ones
that would like

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:84%
to show up because everything
is always an intuitive element.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And they just line
themselves up.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And one DNA could be responsible
for a Pleiadian connection.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.148 align:middle line:84%
Another one could be responsible
for their psychic abilities

00:29:30.148 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:90%
or their clairvoyant abilities.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And each of them could be
affected in some kind of way

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:90%
negatively.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I just go and just
do whatever activation

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
is necessary, whether it's
channeling light or clearing

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
some distortion away from
it, or if I'm rearranging it

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
with energy because
sometimes I also use tools

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:90%
with the DNA as well.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it depends on what is
needed for each DNA strand.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When she came
to you for assistance,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
what did she ask for?

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: She asked
for a DNA activation

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:84%
because she felt that there
were certain blockages that she

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was having with regards to
connecting more with just

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:90%
her own spiritual connection.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like,
yeah, let's do it.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what came up was
her Pleiadian connection

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
because she is
someone that's been

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect the dots
better with regards to herself.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that is where she started
with the Pleiadian connection.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that expanded
into many other layers as well.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could put
together the perfect DNA

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:90%
combination, what would that be?

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.647 align:middle line:84%
What would make somebody
the most optimal?

00:30:39.647 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: The most optimal.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's the DNA
for the third eye.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
one for the body

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.945 align:middle line:84%
and then the DNA for their
galactic connections.

00:30:53.945 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can
work on all those?

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.237 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: And I can
work on all of those.

00:30:57.237 --> 00:30:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the one with the
body is really important

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
because people have different
blockages in the body,

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.175 align:middle line:84%
of course, because of what
they eat and lifestyle

00:31:05.175 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I would do
a certain DNA activation

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that would, for example, help
the energies of their heart

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or help them move through
certain emotional blockages

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.990 align:middle line:84%
because we also hold
emotions and heavy things

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:90%
within the body as well.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And so these DNA
activations, what they do

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is that they help the
body release energy.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So these releases can
manifest in them burping,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
vomiting, extra trips
to the bathroom,

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:90%
yawning, or things like that.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you solve more
emotional issues or physical?

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It's more
emotional, but many of them

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:90%
trickle down into physical.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
multidimensionality?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Multidimensionality
is basically us having other

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
versions of ourselves or other
avatars that are existing

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
in multiple
dimensional realities--

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Within us.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: --within us.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But they are also
parallel to us.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So within us, we
have the ability

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
to connect with those parallel
versions of ourselves.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
exactly within us.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But the ability to connect
with them is within us, yes.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:90%
But they exist in multiple--

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it us?

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Are we the
multidimensionalities?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So every person has
their own multidimensional

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
aspects or
multidimensional avatars.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It depends
on the person

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
because, with some
people, it's 10.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it's
even more than that.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yeah.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So these multidimensional
avatars can be angelic.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
They can be in the
fairy or dragon,

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and they can even extend into
the extraterrestrial realm.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
avatars in the SSP

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that are existing parallel
to their human self.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Like myself, for example,
I have other avatars

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that are in the SSP or existing
as other extraterrestrials

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.523 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as this
version of myself here.

00:32:59.523 --> 00:33:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
get rid of an avatar

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.388 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want around?

00:33:02.388 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: I don't get rid of it.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
They're just there.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.508 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You keep them?

00:33:05.508 --> 00:33:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It's not
that I keep them.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It's that they're just existing
doing other important missions

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that I'm honestly not fully
aware of all the time.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're just doing other
things in other realities.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
sometimes, Antonio,

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
are not cognizant of their
lives, their many lives.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:90%
How do you unlock that?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So I take
people through a process

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:84%
of asking certain questions
if they want to know more

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.240 align:middle line:90%
about their past lives.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I help to guide
people so that they

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:90%
can connect with the memories.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is that I
open the energetic channel

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
because people usually
have certain blockages that

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
prevent them from
accessing certain memories.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So I just clear the
channel, and then that

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
allows for the memories
and all the information

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:90%
to start flowing through.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens next
with the human spirit?

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go after this?

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Well, it's a process.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like now
what the universe

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
is doing with the collective,
one of the biggest focus

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is the body and
purging the body.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:84%
That would be changing
certain habits and lifestyle,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
exercising, doing
ceremonies, really

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
clearing the body so that
the body can become a clearer

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:84%
vessel to hold these
higher energies that

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:90%
are coming through.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And the integration
of all of that

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:84%
will be in the
spiritual practices

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
that people create and cultivate
in their personal lives.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the big
focus for everyone

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is to cultivate their own
practices so that they

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:49.590 align:middle line:84%
can become a clear vessel to
embody the new energies that

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.500 align:middle line:90%
are coming through.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you teach
people to do this?

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Or can they do it on their own?

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yeah, people
can do this on their own.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But if they need
additional assistance,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I do provide that in my courses.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
deal with children?

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Children?

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: They're
just not my focus.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.132 align:middle line:90%
I deal mostly with--

00:35:09.132 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just not your
specialty I guess.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.166 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: It's really-- no.

00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's not my specialty.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say in your career

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
of helping people this way
was the strangest person who

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:90%
ever approached you?

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened after that?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, many, many.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yeah, I've had
many strange experiences.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any dangerous to you?

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.713 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: No, no, no.

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:33.513 align:middle line:90%
I've never--

00:35:33.513 --> 00:35:34.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't go crazy?

00:35:34.783 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't lunge at you
or anything like that?

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.533 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: No, no, no.

00:35:37.533 --> 00:35:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I have a very strong layer
of protection in my energy.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really attract
any crazies like that.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But I've had some
bizarre type of clients.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
was this client

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that I was helping her
unlock some past life

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
memories because
she has some trauma,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't fully understand
where it was coming from.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I helped unlock
some of it for her.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And it traced back to
her being experimented on

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
by certain machines and
artificial intelligence

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
in past lives where they
were hacking into her brain

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and putting all kinds of
physical cybernetic things

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.655 align:middle line:90%
on her energy.

00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And when that information
was coming through,

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
she had a very traumatic,
visceral response to that.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And she started
crying and wailing.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is all on
the phone online.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not in person.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I helped walk
her through that.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that was
really intense.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what are
they like afterwards?

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It's a big
release of energy.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And they feel so much lighter.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
There's always a joy
at the end of it.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:90%
But in their own processes--

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of them, they
do give me feedback weeks

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:84%
later and just let me
know how they were doing.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, in
their integration process,

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:90%
there's more releasing.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:84%
There's more of an
emotional thing that

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.570 align:middle line:90%
happens throughout the weeks.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
back and be like, hey,

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:90%
this is what happened.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But they're always
very grateful for.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
had a magic wand,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and you could wave
it over humanity,

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:90%
what would you ask for?

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So that humanity
is more understanding

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
elements that are trying

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to integrate because a
lot of what's happening

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
is even though we're moving
forward with a timeline,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:84%
it could be going a
little bit faster.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it's a little bit slow

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
is because of their ability
to grasp and understand

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:90%
what is happening.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I would wave a
magic wand to speed up

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
that aha moment for people.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we make this shift?

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Can we make this move?

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yes, we can.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
We are actually very well on
our way to making this shift.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What things do you
have coming up to get us there?

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ARILO: Well, I
have some courses

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.930 align:middle line:10%
that I am in the process of
creating that will initiate

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:10%
people into certain
energies and equip them

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:10%
with certain spiritual
tools so that then they

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:10%
can help other people.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So I am focused on
creating leaders

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and so that people can step
into their spiritual leadership

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
roles and so then
they can create

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
their own stuff
and their own tools

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
and help other people that way.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Antonio, how
do people find you?

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ARILO: So they can find
me through my website,

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:10%
thesunconsciousness.com.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:10%
It also has all the links to
my social media, Facebook,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:10%
Instagram, and YouTube.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:
thesunconsciousness.com.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Yes,
thesunconsciousness.com.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have any regrets
in the path you've taken?

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Regrets?

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't say that I do.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.010 align:middle line:90%
What happens next for you?

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Well, we have
an event that we're

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:84%
going to call the Sun
Fire Festival in August.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
going to be joining

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different Indigenous
energies and also new wave

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:84%
energies that are
going to help usher

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:84%
just these new
energies in for people.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
very interesting.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm also looking forward
to other potential events

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.540 align:middle line:84%
this year that hopefully
I can be a part of.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
turn down a client?

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: I have turned
down a couple of them,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
especially with the courses.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:84%
People are free to book the
regular one on one sessions.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't really turn them down.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But if they want
to do the courses,

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
there is a screening
process, an interview

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that I do with them just to
make sure they're a fit for it.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: So there were some
people that were just not ready

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So this could be with either
their intentions were not

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:84%
in the right place, or they
were just genuinely not

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:90%
ready for that level yet.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the clientele
more men or women?

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.807 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It's been the vast
majority of them were women.

00:39:54.807 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
interesting and intriguing?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: It is very interesting,
but I understand why.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
there are aspects of me,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
especially in past life, that
I made some kind of contract

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:84%
with the female polarity
to basically be there

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.378 align:middle line:90%
for the feminine collective.

00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know you're
healing the planet doing

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing, don't you?

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARILO: Yes.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
feel about that?

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: I feel very
much in alignment

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.740 align:middle line:90%
with myself and my mission.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Antonio, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.365 align:middle line:84%
>>ARILO: Thank
you for having me.

00:40:26.365 --> 00:40:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Very glad to be here.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What an incredible
person to have on this planet,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.730 align:middle line:10%
healing this planet
when not a lot of people

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.850 align:middle line:10%
have been doing it.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
