00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:11.165 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.715 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
to another fascinating episode

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:10%
You know, so many
people are going

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
through so many different
kinds of hardships,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
economic, emotional.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:10%
We're going to give you hope on
this "Beyond Belief" episode.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest
is James Paris,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:10%
author of a course, "Pray
for a Financial Miracle."

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.146 align:middle line:10%
He also heads up the
website christianmoney.com.

00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:52.697 align:middle line:10%
He is a noted
radio host himself.

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Jim, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES PARIS:
Thank you so much.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:10%
Good to be with you, George.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.325 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Always a pleasure.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:10%
You have had probably one of
the most fascinating up and down

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:10%
roller coaster stories I
have ever heard in my life.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into a lot of that

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
with "Pray for a
Financial Miracle."

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But tell us a little
bit about Jim Paris.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Well, by the age of
30, I was a multimillionaire.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.044 align:middle line:10%
By the age of 40,
I was bankrupt.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Gosh, I was going
to ask for a little loan.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.395 align:middle line:10%
I guess we can't.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: So I've
been through a lot.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And it's been quite a journey.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:10%
In fact, after I
lost all my money,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:10%
I planned out my own suicide
on three separate occasions.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.253 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Because I made the
mistake like a lot of people

00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
do, which is I had
tied my self-esteem,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
my self-worth up into what
I did for my career, which

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
was I was a financial
guy going on radio,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:90%
TV shows, writing books.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So my thought was, what do
I do after I'm bankrupt?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
How does a financial
guy, a financial expert,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.377 align:middle line:84%
go from bankruptcy court
to his next TV appearance?

00:01:56.377 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to want to
listen to what I have to say.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:90%
But I was wrong.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And God had a different
plan for my life.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And this journey I've been
on has been quite a ride.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
But, personally, I live
near Daytona Beach, Florida.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I sort of reinvented
my life now.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a big bricks
and mortar business

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
guy with lots of employees
and multiple locations.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Now I work from home.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a nationally
syndicated radio show.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a small sailboat that
I spend a lot of time on.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I just finished my
second degree black belt.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And so life goes on.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.395 align:middle line:84%
And I'm stronger than before
because of what I went through.

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.545 align:middle line:84%
I've been married now
for almost 27 years.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have three adult children
and two dogs, I should mention,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that I love as well.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
it sounds like you're

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
at peace with yourself.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: I am.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it
gave me an opportunity

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
when I lost everything to
kind of reevaluate my life.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And as odd as this
might sound to people,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
I really am happier today
than I've ever been.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I was really on a
treadmill before.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And the truth was, George,
I was making so much

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
money traveling around
that I didn't have time

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to manage my own finances.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's how I got
in trouble that I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:10%
did where my accountant
embezzled $2 million from me.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.627 align:middle line:10%
It was also my brother,
which made it even worse.

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And there
is a double-whammy.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Yeah, it really
messed with my psychology

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:10%
when you start
thinking about maybe

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:10%
I can never trust another person
again if my own brother, who's

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:10%
my accountant, would
embezzle from me.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:10%
But I've really
reinvented myself.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.074 align:middle line:10%
And my book is
really about hope.

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:10%
It's about that, when you go
through something like this--

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a job
loss, or something

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.864 align:middle line:10%
more dramatic like a
bankruptcy, or a foreclosure--

00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:10%
that you can bounce back
from those kinds of things.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And not only just
get back to where

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:84%
you were before but
really even get back

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to a better place in your
life, a place of more peace

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and happiness if
you let God provide

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
that opportunity to you.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a little more
knowledge, too, I hope.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yes, a few more
gray hairs but more knowledge

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's talk about
how Jim Paris made the money

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and then talk about
the embezzlement

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and how that happened,
probably right under your nose.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But you thought,
hey, all is well.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm making money.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Things are good.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
So you're a financial analyst.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:90%
You're talking on the radio.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:90%
You're talking on TV.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:90%
You had books.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.325 align:middle line:84%
So the dollars are
flowing in to you.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Right, and I actually
started at the age of 21

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:90%
as a stockbroker.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And within two years, I became
a regional vice president

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
of the firm that
I was working for.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I had men working
for me in their 60s.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And there I was
21, 22 years old.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I was flying to Europe.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I was making--

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.163 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A whiz kid.

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah, I was
one of those guys.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And everything I
touched turned to gold.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was 30,
I had made so much money

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that I decided to
start my own companies.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.932 align:middle line:84%
So I had my own
nationwide brokerage firm.

00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you the
wolf on Wall Street?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: I'm not quite
as exotic as the wolf

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:10%
on Wall Street but maybe a more
conservative version of that.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I started
my own brokerage firm

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:90%
which went nationwide.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having multiple
offices, and lots of employees,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and all the money that
went with all of that.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the truth
is I wasn't happy.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I was writing books.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I was doing lots of
TV, lots of radio.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a nationally syndicated
TV show, a nationally syndicated

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
radio show.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.711 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you weren't happy.

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: I really-- now that
I look back at the time,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
I may have thought that I was.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But really, something
was missing, George.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what it
really was now that I look back.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:10%
It was that the pursuit,
for me, the end game

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:10%
was about getting money.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:10%
That was what the focus was,
how much money can I accumulate.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But over time, after I began
to accumulate a lot of money,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't exciting anymore.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't interesting anymore.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
going on a caged hunt,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
because it became
so easy for me.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
When I lost
everything, it gave me

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.724 align:middle line:84%
a chance to deepen my
relationship with my wife.

00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And yourself.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: And myself, and
my kids, and with God.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was the kind
of guy that I would

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:90%
laugh at people that had boats.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I would say, what do
you have a boat for?

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:90%
You should be out making money.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm a guy who's out on--
I'm out on my sailboat at least

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:10%
two days a week out
sailing with the dolphins

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:10%
and all the sea creatures
around me in the ocean.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm also somebody that
doesn't miss any events

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:10%
with my kids who are now adult.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
They're all college-age
and so forth.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always there to be
at their different events,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and performances,
and special days.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I was the dad, every
dad was in the room

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't there for the
ballet recital or the Little

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
League baseball game.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I was absent from a
lot of those things.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But when I lost everything
back in 2001, something in me

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that real
wealth was not money.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know that we
need money to live.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And so my book gets into
what do we do to get money

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and what can God
do to direct us.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But true wealth is
being totally at peace

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.006 align:middle line:90%
even if you have no money.

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And I never had that,
George, no matter

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
how much money that
I had accumulated.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
secret, I think,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
as we get along in
this program, Jim,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is how to utilize
whatever money you

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:90%
do make to keep yourself happy.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Whether you make enough money to
just simply rent an apartment,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
or live in a mobile
home, or own a mansion,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be that barometer
there that you find, that mix,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
in order to be happy.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about your
brother for a moment.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:10%
So as you accumulate your wealth
and you've got all this money,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:10%
what do you?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
You bring him into
the fold or what?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: My brother started with
me in my shipping department.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So younger than me, six
years younger than me,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
never had the financial
acumen, never went to college.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So I started him in my
shipping department.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And he slowly worked
his way up to being

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:90%
an assistant to my accountant.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple of
years, my accountant came in

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and he said to me,
look, you don't need me.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Your brother has learned a to z.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.947 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'll make
a deal with you.

00:07:57.947 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
You can save yourself
a little bit of money,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:90%
make him the accountant.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.697 align:middle line:84%
I'll just check the books
every quarter for you.

00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:10%
And then of course--

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.071 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Get a a
little fee for that.

00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Sure, since we were
a regulated business, George,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.066 align:middle line:10%
once a year we had to
have a big audit done.

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:14.065 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happened.

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he with
what was called then

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
one of the regional
eight accounting firms?

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: It wasn't
a big eight firm.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was a big firm
regionally, well-known firm

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
in our area, that
was doing our audits.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And George, the
embezzlement by my brother

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
took place for about
five-year period.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those schemes where

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
there are two sets
of books being kept.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And so even the auditors--

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Miss it.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Right, and my
attorney even considered

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
having us sue the auditors.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
But he said it would take years.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And who knows if we won or not.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of those-- I had to
sort of decide to cut my losses

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and not pursue them legally.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:90%
But I probably could have.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, it was
a deceptive thing.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:10%
And during those years, George,
my brother and I were not just

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.295 align:middle line:10%
professionally close, but
we were personally close.

00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:04.878 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of course,
he's your brother.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: He had children around
the same age as my children.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So as you can
imagine, every time we

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
had a kid's birthday,
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
4th of July, all of our
families got together.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was just one of those
kind of big family gatherings.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And then to find out--
which how I found out

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:90%
was a shocking morning.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
When my accountant was doing
the audit, he said to me,

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
he says, Mr. Paris,
we have discovered

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
from the first
quarter of last year

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's
$130,000 discrepancy

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:90%
from the first quarter only.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
assumed that this was

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
a mistake of some sort a
misunderstanding, if you will.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:90%
And one thing led to the next.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
We stopped counting
at $2 million.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
well beyond that.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:10%
But my attorney
said, look, how much

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:10%
more money do you want to
spend on a forensic audit

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:10%
and purchasing backups of
the bank records trying

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:10%
to rebuild your financials.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So we stopped counting
at $2 million.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you lose $2 million
out of your operating account,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.697 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were a fairly
substantial company, but--

00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
thought it was there.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah, losing $2
million out of your operating,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.025 align:middle line:90%
and then--

00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big bite.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: What really brought me
down was that all of my capital

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that I had to be in business
as a brokerage firm was all

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
stolen.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And my brother was producing
to the securities regulators,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
he was producing
forged documents

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
showing them that we had
our operating capital, which

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
is to protect the public
in case you go under.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
this money as security.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they came down on my
company like a ton of bricks.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:10%
And my attorney
explained to me a term

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:10%
called vicarious
liability, which

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:10%
means that even though
you didn't do any of this,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.724 align:middle line:10%
the person that did this
was under your authority.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.015 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was one of you people.

00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: So you have to fall
on your sword with them.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So that sort of
ruined the whole deal.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you notice
that your brother was living

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
differently, maybe a
little higher on the hog?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: He was
living more richly.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But as part of this ingenious
scheme that he had hatched,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
he had a cover story.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And his cover story was that
his wife's grandfather was

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
beginning to distribute his
estate prior to his death

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.155 align:middle line:84%
and that he had received several
million dollars from his wife's

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:90%
grandfather.

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was
the wife in on it?

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: The wife went
along with the story,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:10%
so I believe
possibly was tacitly

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.117 align:middle line:10%
involved in this whole matter.

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:10%
And so that was the cover story.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:10%
So I was loving to
see my little brother

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:10%
building this big
house with a big pool

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:10%
and getting cars and little
ATV motorcycles for his kids.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he made
a salary with you.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Right, and I just loved
seeing my brother doing so well

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
never realizing that I was
paying for all of it, George,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
never realizing it.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
this scheme unravel?

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, it
started with the auditors

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:90%
doing the annual audit.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
We had the same auditing
firm for five years.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
But when we had relocated
our main accounting functions

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to Florida from Dallas,
the new auditor came in,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and within just two or three
days of going through our books

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and records, had
discovered discrepancy.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It was just an immediate thing.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when we started
looking into it, of course,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I had that confrontation
with my brother.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he deny?

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: He
absolutely denied it.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And the confrontation was
really me asking him, look,

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
there's obviously some
misunderstanding here

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:90%
about the accounting.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a discrepancy
of over $100,000.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, it's just
a misunderstanding.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll clear it up.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
That went on for about 10 days.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.087 align:middle line:10%
And I began to press
him a little bit more.

00:12:56.087 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were suspecting
at this point, right?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Yeah, we've got to come
up-- we've got to resolve this.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Our audit will not be signed off
on unless we can resolve this.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I get an email that
says I will no longer speak

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to you, speak to me only
through my attorney.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From your brother?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Right,
this is my brother.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, whoa.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.825 align:middle line:84%
And so he hires one of the
most expensive high profile--

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:21.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had he left the firm?

00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Yes.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I had learned that that
morning he had not only

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
left his office, which was a
different physical location

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
from where I was working,
but he had left also

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of bankers boxes
which we later learned that,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
in an attempt to
cover his tracks,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that he had stolen bank records
going back more than 10 years

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:90%
from our warehouse.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:90%
So he disappeared.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And he hired one of the highest
profile attorneys in Orlando

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
who formerly used to work for
the government as a prosecutor.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And so my book
gets into now what

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
turns into be a drama
almost like the movie,

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost like Tom Cruise
in the movie "The Firm."

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing is
starting to be turned around

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.292 align:middle line:84%
on me like somehow I
have stolen this money.

00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That you
were the guilty--

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.166 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: From my
own company, I've

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:10%
strip mined my own company.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:10%
And I was facing a potential
five years in prison

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:10%
unless I could clear my name.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So here I was, it
wasn't bad enough

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
that I was broke and bankrupt.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But I was facing
possible criminal charges

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:90%
for having this money missing.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.459 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- I literally planned
out my suicide in detail

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:90%
on three occasions.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.791 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How were
you going to do it.

00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:40.492 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, I
wanted, honestly,

00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to kill myself in a
way that it didn't necessarily

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:90%
look like a suicide.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like you were murdered?

00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: That it was
an unexplained death.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And I had planned it out
to take place probably

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:10%
near the beach where the
forensics would be weak

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:10%
if they found me
the next morning.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.485 align:middle line:90%
This all sounds crazy.

00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: But that's
the mindset I was in.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And my wife saw me one morning
at 3:00 AM in my office

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:10%
thumbing through one of
my insurance policies,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:10%
because I had several
million dollars--

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You had to make
sure that was covered.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.195 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: I was making sure
that the two years on suicide

00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:10%
had passed.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, she didn't know
what I was doing.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:84%
She said, why are you looking
at the insurance policy?

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.499 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I'm just reviewing
some of our financial holdings

00:15:22.499 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:90%
And she accepted that.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she knew
that things had unraveled.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And years later, when she
put two and two together

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and realized that that very
night that she had stumbled

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
across what I was doing
that I was actually

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in the final stages of
planning my own suicide

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.864 align:middle line:84%
by making sure that the
suicide provision would not

00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
prevent my family
from getting the death

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
benefit after I killed myself.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a-- if you can
imagine a financial planner

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
planning his own death, that's
the kind of thing that you do.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's where I was at.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What made you stop?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you do it?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: You know,
George, I got to the point

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
where, honestly,
I said to myself,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to kill myself,
it can't get any worse.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If I'm already at this point
that I'm going to kill myself,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:90%
how much worse can it be?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just decided that I was
just going to live every day.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
one day at a time.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I literally had to live it one
minute, one hour at a time.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just woke up
every day and just tried

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to breathe and stay peaceful
and relaxed as much as I could.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And take these
issues one at a time.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: And I had
to-- when you talk

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to an attorney about a collapse
of a business like this,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not like a consumer
that goes to bankruptcy court

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing's
over in 60 days

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they show up
one time for 10 minutes

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge their bankruptcy
in front of the judge.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
My bankruptcy took
almost three years.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.926 align:middle line:84%
And it was considered to be
a highly complex bankruptcy.

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:57.042 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
corporate or personal?

00:16:57.042 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Personal bankruptcy,
the corporations just folded.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.975 align:middle line:84%
But my personal bankruptcy was
considered a highly complex

00:17:03.975 --> 00:17:04.475 align:middle line:90%
bankruptcy.

00:17:04.475 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:10%
And to top it all off, I had
no money for an attorney.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:10%
So there I was having
only finished one

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:10%
year of law school.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:10%
I was representing
myself in federal court

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:10%
as my own attorney for
almost three years.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.384 align:middle line:90%
That was part of my life.

00:17:18.384 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people I'd run
into, they'd say, hey, Jim,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:90%
come on man.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
Just go forward with your life,
stop looking into the past.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.161 align:middle line:84%
This has all happened,
move forward.

00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'd love to.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But I've got a hearing I've
got to be at in Jacksonville

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:90%
on Monday.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've got this, and this, and
this, and this lawsuit that's

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:90%
coming up against me.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because a small percentage
of my company was owned by

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:90%
private investors, only 10%.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:90%
But nonetheless, these folks--

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
were ticked at you.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: They were upset.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.253 align:middle line:90%
Look, they had lost their money.

00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's got
to be to blame.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
So you go to the guy at the top.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I had legal
issues that were

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
unraveling from all of that.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very, very
complicated thing.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was several years
where I really could not

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
go out and even take a
full-time job if I wanted to.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
forgive your brother?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: I did
forgive my brother.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, back
on August 8, in 2008,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never been one of
these numerology guys,

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
although I will tell
you that in the Bible

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.734 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot that has
to do with numerology.

00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure does.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: There's
so much in there.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing for months
coming up to this August 8,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
2008 how people were using that
date for different purposes.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:10%
And the number eight,
many people argue,

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:10%
is God's number
for new beginnings.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of Christians were
looking at this date, August 8,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:10%
2008, to plan the
launch of a business,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:10%
or start a new church,
or whatever the plan was.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, wow,
maybe that could

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
be the day that I write
a letter to my brother

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.202 align:middle line:90%
to forgive him personally.

00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he wasn't in
jail or anything like that?

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: No, he was never
criminally prosecuted.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Although, he did get a $5
million judgment against him

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in court which my
bankruptcy-- became

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:90%
an asset of my bankruptcy.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
much if anything

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:90%
they ever got from that.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They may not
have collected it all.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Sure, absolutely.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%
So I call my wife.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:90%
She's a school teacher.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.169 align:middle line:84%
She's finishing up usually
around two o'clock.

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So I called her up.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Ann, I've
got something special

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I want us to do.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.709 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it was a Friday.

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And she thought maybe I
was going to take her out

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.125 align:middle line:84%
to dinner or
something like that.

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So I said, try to get home
as quickly as you can.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So she gets home, says
what are we doing?

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
What do I have-- how
do I have to dress?

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, nothing, just
the way you are is fine.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You told her
not to wear anything?

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: No, just the way
she was, her school clothes.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:90%
So she jumps in the car.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And she says,
where are we going?

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.309 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't tell
you until we get there.

00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
We go to the post office
in our little town

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
of Palm Coast, Florida.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And I park the car right
next to the mailbox, George.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I reached in the
glove box and I pulled out

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the letter that was
dated August 8, 2008.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, I said, I
cannot mail this letter without

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:90%
your blessing.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And she opened the letter up.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And all the letter said,
George, was Carmen,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
you've never apologized for
what you've done or taken

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:90%
any responsibility.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.442 align:middle line:90%
But I forgive you.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:90%
You owe me nothing, signed Jim.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And my wife is
reading this letter.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And the tears are
streaming down her face.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And the tears are
streaming down my face.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
honey, this is OK.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:90%
You can mail this letter.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So I folded the letter up,
put it back in the envelope,

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
sealed it.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I walked over to
the mailbox, George.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I put that letter in
the mailbox August 8, 2008.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And the financial blessings
that began to happen to me

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
were unreal.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to use a pun,
beyond belief, unbelievable.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I would have-- I remember
telling one of my good friends

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
from college, he comes
down to have lunch with me,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.557 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling him the story
of what's happening to me.

00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:00.931 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting
there eating lunch.

00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I'm going
to pick up the tab.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:03.972 align:middle line:10%
He says, well, wait a minute.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:10%
His little girl was with him.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I think she wants
to get a dessert.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:10%
And they added a couple things.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.461 align:middle line:10%
The waitress comes
back to the table,

00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:10%
she says, I'm sorry to
interrupt you, here's your bill.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.903 align:middle line:84%
She said, by the way, we
made a number of mistakes

00:21:13.903 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:90%
on your bill.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.726 align:middle line:84%
We're only charging you
for one of the meals.

00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're not charging
you for the ice cream.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And she's going through
this, and my friend,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:90%
he's staring at me.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, Russ, this
is what's happening to me.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I touch,
this is happening to me.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was maybe a
little bit skeptical.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But after he saw that, I
mean, it wasn't a big deal.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like we saved maybe
$12 or $15 on our lunch bill.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But this is what began
to happen in my life.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe, George,
that holding a grudge,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.845 align:middle line:90%
carrying bitterness--

00:21:45.845 --> 00:21:47.094 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's negative energy.

00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: It is.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And it can block God from
being able to really release

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:90%
blessings into your life.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, for me, it
really changed my focus, George.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:10%
My energy was all about how
angry I was with my brother

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:10%
and how--

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: At everything.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.199 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Yeah, and I was a
victim, and this is terrible,

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:10%
and I shouldn't be
in this situation.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So all of my energy
is going towards this.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.817 align:middle line:90%
My psychiatrist gives me a test.

00:22:12.817 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, I've got to test
you for something called

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:90%
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.212 align:middle line:90%
So he gives me this test.

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
My next appointment,
he comes back,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.378 align:middle line:84%
he says, I got the
results for your test.

00:22:22.378 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, you could not
have tested any higher.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
He said you have the worst
case of post-traumatic stress

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.619 align:middle line:84%
disorder that I have
ever diagnosed since--

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like worse
than a military person.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Exactly.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.781 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I've
never been to war.

00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:90%
How could this affect me?

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, you wake up multiple
times a night with nightmares?

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And he started going through.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, you have PTSD.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So as I went through these
sessions with my psychiatrist,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:90%
it all began to crystallize.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And I became really
healed emotionally

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:90%
when I forgave my brother.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:10%
And all of that energy
that was focused on I'm

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:10%
going to get even
somehow, he's going

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.411 align:middle line:10%
to get his bad karma from all
of this, all of that was gone,

00:23:06.411 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:10%
George.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like a new person.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying
around this weight.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.561 align:middle line:90%
And this weight was gone.

00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, people have said
to me, "How could you do it?

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
How could you forgive
your brother after all

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%
that he had done?

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
He's stolen all your money,
put you in bankruptcy,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.422 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying to frame
you so you would go to prison.

00:23:24.422 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how could
you forgive him?"

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I
forgave him for me,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and I forgave him because it
was what God wanted me to do."

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I don't focus
at all on him anymore.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has he ever
communicated with you?

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: No, he hasn't other
than when my father passed away

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.335 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 years ago, my
father had prayed and prayed.

00:23:45.335 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And he had told my mother--

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you guys
got back together.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: He told
my mother, he says,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:10%
my one last wish in this world
is that my one son Carmen would

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:10%
apologize to my other son, Jim.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if there will ever
be a reconciliation, he said,

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:10%
but that's my one last
wish in this world.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
George, as they're getting
ready to close the casket,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.834 align:middle line:84%
we're as the family
in an awkward moment--

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:08.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extremely.

00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:09.916 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: He's still my brother.

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing on the
other side of the casket.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:90%
They're getting ready.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
They're making the
final adjustments.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.826 align:middle line:84%
They're closing the
lid of the casket.

00:24:16.826 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And my brother looks
across the casket at me.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:10%
And he whispers, "I'm sorry for
everything I've done, Jimmy."

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, I wish I could tell
you that after the fact

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:10%
there was some real heartfelt
repentant action that

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:10%
would follow that
up, like he tried

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:10%
to repay some of the money or
do something-- None of that.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But I was so grateful that
my father's final wishes--

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.936 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you lose it?

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:43.837 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: I'm sorry?

00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emotionally,
did you lose it?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: I was-- you know,
I'll be honest with you,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhat cynical
at that moment.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But I was emotional that whole
day, really feeling like here's

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:84%
my father passing
and there's still

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
this division in our family.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like that his
final wish was answered.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And he probably knew, as my
mother has now shared with me,

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
he knew it was unrealistic
really for my brother and I

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.697 align:middle line:90%
to ever be reconciled again.

00:25:12.697 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's another thing about--

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You couldn't
be best friends.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.605 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah, people
don't understand.

00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:18.044 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness doesn't mean that--

00:25:18.044 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Socializing, right?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: --we're now
slapping each other's backs

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:90%
out together, spending time.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:24.644 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:25:24.644 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You got me, Carmen.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Right, that's
not going to happen.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:10%
But you know, it was
my father's last wish

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.694 align:middle line:10%
that there would be an apology.

00:25:32.694 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what's
in my brother's heart.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at that moment, he
meant something there.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And I accept that.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
But I had already forgiven him.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was not
necessary for me to be

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.644 align:middle line:84%
able to move forward
with my life.

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is he doing now?

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, he continues to
have a lot of problems, George.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could tell you
that he took this experience

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and turned his life around.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:90%
But he really hasn't.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
You read the stories in the
Bible and other ancient books

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
about reaping and sowing.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.456 align:middle line:84%
And he's now reaping
what he's sown.

00:26:06.456 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The karma
has come back.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.917 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Yes, sir.

00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sad.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PARIS: Yes, it is.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On our next
"Beyond Belief,"

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
into your work,

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
how to pray for a financial
miracle and what people can do.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But what advice, Jim, after
this ordeal you went through,

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
what would you tell people
who may be contemplating

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.815 align:middle line:90%
the same things you did?

00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Well, as I said,
once you get to the point

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're ready
to kill yourself,

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:90%
it can't get any worse.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It can't get any worse.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.782 align:middle line:10%
It can only get better, my gosh.

00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Right, I
mean, it can only

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:10%
get better from that point.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I think
sometimes people

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:10%
that are very creative
people, writers like myself,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:10%
people that have vivid
imaginations, I think what we

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:10%
imagine, George,
is going to happen

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:10%
is such an unrealistic
worst-case scenario.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Like I talk about in
the book, I worried,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I laid awake at night
for months, George,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
when we were losing
our family home.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I laid awake for months
at night wondering, oh,

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
what is that day
going to be like?

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I literally imagined
my family and I standing

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
on the street corner with a sign
like we were homeless people.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just crazy things
that you think about.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will work
for food, you know?

00:27:20.773 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: George, the day
after I lost my home,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.705 align:middle line:84%
I moved into a bigger
home the next day.

00:27:25.705 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd that happen?

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PARIS: Yeah, I found an ad
in Craigslist, met a lady,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:90%
told her my story.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
She became immediately
sympathetic to me

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and my situation.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Moved into a larger home,
not only as a renter

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:84%
but had a lease with
the option to buy,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:90%
eventually bought the house.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:90%
My family was thrilled.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what my advice is,
George, as much as people

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
want to imagine the
worst-case scenario,

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
imagine another scenario
that's the best-case scenario.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And probably the truth
is somewhere in between.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, in my
case, the best-case scenario

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
has what's continued
to happen to me.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, you
lose everything.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:90%
What could happen next?

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You're homeless, or that you
move into an even bigger house.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are the
odds of that happening?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But to allow God
to just provide you

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:90%
with a miracle in that moment.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is, just
like with the seasons, George,

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
there's winter and
then there's spring.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:90%
There's the rain.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:10%
And then there's that
moment after the rain

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:10%
where the sun is coming out.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And man, that moment
is coming for you.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Right now, you're in the
rain and the darkness.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:10%
But man, that moment
is coming very soon

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:10%
when it's all going
to turn around.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's all going
to be a distant memory.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:10%
Don't stop the movie
at this dark moment,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.467 align:middle line:10%
because there is a happy
ending waiting for you.

00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.258 align:middle line:10%
>>PARIS: Thank you,
sir, good to be here.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.019 align:middle line:10%

heard today on "Beyond Belief."
