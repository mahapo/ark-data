00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest
today, Brad Olsen.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:10%
He's an award-winning author,
publisher, television guest

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
on many shows like "Ancient
Aliens," "America Unearthed,"

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.720 align:middle line:10%
and "Mysteries of
the National Parks."

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He has researched and written
about giants to small humanoids

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to the big giants all
across our planet.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.232 align:middle line:90%
Brad, welcome to the program.

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRAD OLSEN: Thanks, George.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in researching giants?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
something somebody

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.312 align:middle line:84%
would wake up and say that's
what I want to do for a living.

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, if you
recall, last time I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:10%
was on "Beyond
Belief" with you, we

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:10%
talked about the
megalithic sites

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:10%
around the world and
some of the mound sites.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.705 align:middle line:10%
I did a book called "Sacred
Places North America."

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And when I was traveling
to many of these sites,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
I remember hearing
all these stories

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:10%
about not only very
unusual artifacts that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
came out of these mound sites,
but these giant skeletons.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there's
a part of history

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:90%
that just is not being told.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And so I set upon myself
to research it and put it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:10%
in my new book "Modern
Esoteric, Beyond Our Senses."

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:
Biblically-speaking, wasn't

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Goliath a giant, a true giant?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It is believed he was.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
No bones to back that theory
up, but it's certainly

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:90%
an interesting proposition.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
a pilot who-- a US pilot

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
during the military era of
Afghanistan, which is still

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
going on, of course,
who claims that he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
was a witness to a dead
giant that he flew out

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%
of Afghanistan.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, wow.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
How tall?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.228 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing story there.

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
This was close to 10
feet, something like that.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: As we know, the
tallest man in the world

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:90%
was the Alton Giant, 8 foot 11.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think anything over 8 foot
11, we have to ask ourselves,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was so
big when he died,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:90%
they had to bury him in a piano.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.024 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He was from Illinois,
and that's where I'm from too.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they grow them
tall in the Midwest.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the giants are
living all over this planet.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
They had been living
all over this planet.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
What was your research
able to find you?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were there
any regions that there

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
were more giants than others?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, when I started
my book "Sacred Places North

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:10%
America," I found that
there was a lot of groupings

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:10%
in the Midwest around the
mound sites of the Hopewell

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.029 align:middle line:10%
and the Adena cultures.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.445 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really,
in North America?

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:10%
And as well as Pennsylvania.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:10%
There's a new
ancient history model

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:10%
called the Maritime archaic,
meaning that they would

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:10%
have come over from Europe.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And there is also
quite a few giants

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:90%
that have been found in Europe.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But of course, since people
had a several hundred-year head

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
start digging those graves in
Europe, most of those relics

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
are gone, whereas the
relics here in North America

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
were preserved up
until the 19th century.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But then we had a lot of
grave robbers go in there

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and take them all out,
and a lot of disappeared.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
withholding of information.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I would
agree with that.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's this narrative that we're
all evolved from the apes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Scientists like to
control the narrative.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you have these
out-of-place artifacts show up,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
when you have these giant
skeletons turn up that are

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:90%
9-feet, 10-feet tall--

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
clearly not human, sometimes
with an extra digit

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
on their fingers and
their toes, as well as

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:90%
double rows of teeth.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
This just throws
everything into a tizzy,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think they'd much rather
just sweep that out of the way

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and keep it safe with
the narrative they're

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:90%
familiar with.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
afraid that if we

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
knew that giants roamed this
planet something would happen?

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what could go wrong?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I guess it's
kind of like the narrative

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:90%
with the ETs.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
How come that's
been so covered up?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Why has this been swept
under the rug too?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the same
vein of the giants,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
because it just doesn't
fit into this cookie cutter

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
framework of all of us evolving
from the same ancestor.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe if they
admit that giants exist,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.902 align:middle line:84%
then they have to admit that
the Bible might be real.

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
that's a good point.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.401 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's kind
of what it comes down to,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
biblical narrative talking

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
points in the Bible
of these giants

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.182 align:middle line:90%
of several different names.

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
evidence, Brad?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Anything like photos and
bones and things like that?

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, you bet.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:10%
Not only here in
North America do

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:10%
we have some photos
from the 19th century

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:10%
and also from Europe, but
hieroglyphics in Egypt showing

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:10%
massive humanlike entities
with little servants washing

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:10%
their feet, but are full
scale humans, not children.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You have the evidence
out of Kigali, Rwanda,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
where some archaeologists
that did not want this to get

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
swept under the rug--

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --released
some of these images.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And these are supposed
to be some of the most

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.811 align:middle line:90%
verified images of giants.

00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And they do have that
double row of teeth.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%
So clearly not human.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when,
you say not human--

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
so you're saying that they were
not indigenous to this planet.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I can't say
that with certainty,

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
because they could
have been ET, or they

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:90%
could have just been here.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were another branch
of humanity that was here.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:10%
If we consider the
age of the Earth

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:10%
being a habitable planet
for millions of years,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:10%
entities could
have come and gone

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.559 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps stayed and
lived in bore children.

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at the dinosaurs.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at how huge they were.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have any animals
as big as the dinosaurs.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
It's entirely possible that the
human beings were that big too

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:90%
when they started to evolve.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And of course, they're gone now.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's correct.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's also some talk
now that perhaps gravity

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
on the planet was not as
strong a few million years ago.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps these giant dinosaurs
or giant humanlike entities

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.144 align:middle line:84%
would have had an
easier time with it.

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a giant footprint

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
in granite in South Africa.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, our good friend
Michael Tellinger takes people

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:90%
out there in his tour groups.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's about as tall as
you are-- six-foot-tall--

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:90%
a footprint.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is embedded
into the granite.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, it shows
six digits on the toe,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
which is very telling.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So once again, not
human, although there

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:84%
are some humans that do have
six fingers and six toes.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not totally uncommon
that humans will have it,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps, again,
this is a throwback

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
to some of these traits that
perhaps we're a descendant of.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mentioned
Michael Tellinger, Brad.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the specifics

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
of what he had to say
about some of this.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: Beautiful.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.176 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
There's the-- you
know when you--

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
there's the big toe and the
four toes down to the small toe,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:90%
down to the heel.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating
about this is anybody

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that does a study of this will
notice this piece sticking out

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you put your foot
in mud, and you pull it out,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
your toes will lift up a little
mud where your toes were,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly what
seems to have happened here.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This rough granite has just
pulled up this overhang here.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It's spectacular.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An obviously
tired Michael Tellinger

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
when he went there to
see that, but that's

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
got to be the foot of a
20- to 40-foot creature.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Clearly not human, or
something that maybe humanlike,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:90%
humanoid.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But with those
kind of heights, I

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
mean, if we just use Robert
Wadlow, the Alton Giant--

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Alton Giant

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --as the
measuring stone, 8 foot 11,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
anything taller than him
would be a complete anomaly.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.777 align:middle line:84%
And many of these mummies
are much taller than that.

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Robert had a
pituitary issue, though,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
didn't he?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He did.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So there-- it's what happens
with some NBA players.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a tumor that
takes in the brain.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Benign?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:90%
A benign tumor?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's benign, although
the giant died in his 20s.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.162 align:middle line:84%
Some of these men
don't live that long.

00:08:38.162 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It killed him.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.411 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it did kill him.

00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
He did not stop growing
his entire life.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's this--

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had he lived,
he would have been--

00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:48.698 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He would
would've kept growing.

00:08:48.698 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps maybe he would
have been a 12-footer,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
but he was having some
major health issues.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
He had to wear braces
all the time on his legs.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Had major shin
splint pains all the time

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:90%
from growing that large.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all his clothes
had to be custom made.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we still have that
genetic makeup to have giants?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There is this area
of Northern Ireland, where

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of
giants came from,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
including this one
that the queen went

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and saw the skeleton of.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
He was in the 8-foot range.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
many of his people

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
in this area that he
lived in were routinely

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:90%
in the 7-foot range.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So it does seem that there
are genetic groupings

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of people, but
nothing in over 10-foot range.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
That, to me--

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's big.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.524 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --is very unhuman.

00:09:41.524 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, there
was a petrified finger

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that was found.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there an
MRI done on that?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There sure was.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And Michael Tellinger also
has some pictures of it,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:90%
holding it.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:56.784 align:middle line:90%
It's about that big.

00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:57.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The finger?

00:09:57.616 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, just the finger.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you would have
attached that to a human

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and done the analysis, it would
have been over 20 foot tall.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And this was found in
the deserts of Egypt.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it biological?

00:10:09.277 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, very much so.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:90%
So they've scanned it.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They can see the
tendons and the bones.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's very much--

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --organic finger bone
with the fingernail as well.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And some scientist was out there
looking, he heard about it,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
had to pay some money
to photograph it.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's all they
would let him do.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you would consider that
this was a 20-foot tall entity,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and some of the hieroglyphics
which also show entities

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
about that big,
maybe we're talking

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Annunaki or the offspring,
the Nephilim, here on Earth.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these Bible
stories have more

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.775 align:middle line:84%
to tell us than we're
giving them credit for.

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, we have talked

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
about how did the Egyptians
build these pyramids.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Did get help from
extraterrestrials?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Did they understand
how to levitate

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
these huge tons of block?

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
What if we had 30 to 40
foot giants on this planet,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
they built the
pyramids, but to them,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.374 align:middle line:84%
they were just like small
little rocks, right?

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
The pyramid stones were massive.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two guys picked
it up and put it there,

00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:20.122 align:middle line:90%
if they're that big.

00:11:20.122 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's the thinking.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And in my talk, "A
Contact in the Desert,"

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I have slides of normal humans
pulling one of the pyramid

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
stones with a cart,
and it takes 20 of them

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to pull one of these
pyramids stones.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But there are also hieroglyphics
of giants just physically

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:90%
lifting these stones up.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have an
archaeologist looking at one

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:90%
of these petrified fingers.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
He's very surprised.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.185 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The picture
of the giant's finger

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
was taken by well-known
researcher Gregor

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Sporri in Egypt in 1988 but
have only just been released.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:10%
The mummified finger
would be considered

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:10%
to be human except
for the fact that it

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:10%
is way, way too large to
have come from a human hand.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:10%
The finger was
reported to have been

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
taken to the museum in Cairo.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, this finger
is not and was never housed

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:90%
in any museum in Egypt.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The researcher now says
that he took the pictures

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
after he reportedly had to pay
an old man from a grave robber

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.222 align:middle line:84%
dynasty $300 to see it
and take pictures of it.

00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh, Brad.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.364 align:middle line:90%
Is that the real thing?

00:12:28.364 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's
the one, yeah.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
the fingernail on it.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.592 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
pictures of it with a--

00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that big.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --Egyptian pound note.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's huge.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And Michael Tellinger holds
it up in one shot, too.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So I guess if you go out to
this remote oasis settlement,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.924 align:middle line:84%
and you pay the right people,
you can have access to it.

00:12:46.924 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
opinion, are we talking

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:90%
about something human or not?

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's humanlike,
and this is where

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
the zone gets a little gray.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
They were very much like us with
limbs, heads, bodies, torsos,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:90%
feet and toes.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are
dissimilarities-- not

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
only the gigantic
size, but sometimes

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
another finger, another toe, and
then the double row of teeth.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
That to me--

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.881 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --is the kicker.

00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
That's really weird.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.344 align:middle line:90%
That has to say--

00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where
would the teeth be?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Behind the other teeth?

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Just backed up right
to the front row.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And in my research
in North America,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I found that many of
them would eat shellfish.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the theory is perhaps to
eat some of these hard shells

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or maybe to crack them, they
needed this extra row of teeth.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So it could have been
an evolutionary thing,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps they came here
and they had this trait.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
These giants died
out, but maybe they

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:84%
mated with humans and
some of those traits,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.344 align:middle line:84%
like the six digits,
still show up today.

00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
going to say, do we

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.569 align:middle line:84%
have reports of people
with two layers of teeth?

00:13:57.569 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That I've
never come across.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've not heard that.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Not in
contemporary times.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But what I found so
interesting, George,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing the research
in North America, that so many

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:84%
of them were buried
as kings and buried

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in very unique fashion,
sometimes sitting,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
or with their heads
touching their mate.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And let's face it,
it wasn't just men.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
It was also women that
were also very tall.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
9-foot tall women skeletons
have also been uncovered.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.597 align:middle line:84%
And they were buried in
these very grand styles.

00:14:28.597 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I would say the same
would be true in Egypt.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But as we know,
there's this Egyptgate.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
In this country, we
call it Smithsoniangate,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.225 align:middle line:90%
because in the 19th century--

00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the same thing.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, there is
headline after headline.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking hundreds
of headlines--

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:90%
giants unearthed from a mound.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Smithsonian comes out.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like
the FBI on the scene.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:90%
We'll take over here.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They take all the
giants back, never

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
heard or seen from them again.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times even a college
and university scientists

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists
were part of that dig.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would inquire
to the Smithsonian,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
what happened to these finds?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
How come there is
no interpretive area

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.320 align:middle line:90%
in the Smithsonian?

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
How come you don't place
any of these skeletons up?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll just say, we
don't have any record.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%
They're lost.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.994 align:middle line:84%
We don't know anything
about that, sir.

00:15:19.994 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know
that whatever happened

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt wasn't the work of
extraterrestrial giants as

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:90%
opposed to pure Egyptians?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, as you know,
the antiquity director

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:10%
for many decades, Zahi
Hawass, had control

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:10%
over all the findings in Egypt.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So if any of these
giants were to turn up,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you can be sure that
he, as the one who

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
controlled this whole story of
pharaohs building everything,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
would have found them as
unsavory as the people

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
at the Smithsonian who
swooped in and took

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:90%
care of those bones.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whenever we
would mention the Zahi--

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and he had been on
"Coast to Coast"

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times
with me over the years

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
before he got ousted during
the Mubarak ousting--

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
he would get so upset at any
reference of extraterrestrials

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:90%
helping to build those pyramids.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
As far as he was concerned, done
by Egyptians, done by humans,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of it.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
hear anything else.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.482 align:middle line:90%
Boy, he really would get upset.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He would
get really upset.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these scientists
here in North America

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:90%
got really upset.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I inquired at a site in
Oklahoma called Spiro Mounds--

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
what happened to the giants?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I even got an interview
with the lead archaeologist,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and he practically threw
me out of the office

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
when I pushed the
issue a little bit.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So they don't want to hear it.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they think
it's just a wild story,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they
get so upset about?

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:90%
What causes that?

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I guess everybody
is a little bit different as

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to why they're offended
by this subject,

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
but if they're part
of the cover-up,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they're
part of the problem

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
rather than part
of the solution.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to understand
in academics that they're also

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
dependent on the funding from,
say, a giant university who

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:90%
would pay for these digs.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And if the findings
don't correspond

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to what the university
wants to hear,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they have
to toe the line.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Genesis makes
a direct correlation

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:84%
between giants and
mankind, talking

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
about how these
giants came down, bred

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
with women of this
planet, and populated

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:90%
the planet with giants.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's there.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
make up that story?

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.383 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Who would
make up that story?

00:17:43.383 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
references not only in our Bible

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:90%
that we know.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But in the Gnostic
text, in the Enoch tax,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
references to these
giants, the Nephilim who

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
are the product of mating
the Annunaki with the humans,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:90%
the men of renown.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So many references
to these giants,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
you would think that it would
become common knowledge.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps when these
findings started coming out,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and the theory of
evolution was taking hold

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century, this would
go against those theories.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
This would go against
that narrative

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
that there was another kind
of human on this planet, which

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't go along with
Darwinian evolution, which

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
would suggest perhaps
they came from elsewhere.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
cover up with aliens.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, they
say the flood of Noah

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
was a direct result of
God wanting to eradicate

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.682 align:middle line:90%
this planet of the Nephilim.

00:18:41.682 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's a good point.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And so many of these
giant artifacts

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:90%
are actually found in Africa.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we're talking about
this Out of Africa theory,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
not only where Homo
sapiens is known

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to have come from,
and by the way,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
has just been redated
another 100,000 years.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
They found some
Homo sapien bones

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
in Morocco 300,000 years old.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That goes against
the old dating of 200,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:90%
240 was the max that was given.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So everything is getting
dated older and older.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, Michael
Cremo is right.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Michael Cremo, who has written
books on human evolution

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and devolution, as he calls it.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
He said that mankind is hundreds
of millions of years old.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And he could be right.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.255 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: If we account
for these humanoid giants,

00:19:30.255 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:90%
he probably is right.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And he coined the phrase
forbidden archeology.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:90%
I met him at a conference.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, Brad,
you can use that term.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
mounds in North America.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with
the Cahokia Mounds,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's in Illinois
right outside of St. Louis.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that--
the mounds of North America.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, the
mounds in North America

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
are pervasive, all across the
Midwest where I come from.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm born and bred in Illinois.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember as a little kid
going up to Devil's Lake

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:90%
in Wisconsin.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And there were the
Effigy Mounds there

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're in the shape of
animals or geometric shapes,

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the
Nazca line sometimes,

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
but built up as mounds rather
than etched into the grounds.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes those effigies
would contain burial items

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes even giants.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:90%
That's just one kind of mounds.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The Cahokia Mound
was this giant mound,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
which is the same base
size as the Great Pyramid.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It is massive.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And then all around it
are these ancillary mounds

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that also have burial
items found in them.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:90%
This is just one site.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, there
are things in the mounds.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.913 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning
to find that out now

00:20:42.913 --> 00:20:44.797 align:middle line:90%
with special instruments.

00:20:44.797 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Then if you go
back to some of the oldest

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
cultures in the Midwest,
such as the Adena

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
or the Hopewell cultures
along the Ohio River Valley,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that's where you start
finding a lot of these giants,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:90%
or they did in the 19th century.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Much have been excavated
and lost unfortunately.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.439 align:middle line:84%
There were just no
laws to preserve that.

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, to give
people a perspective

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.871 align:middle line:84%
about the size of
these mounds, give us

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
an idea how big are--
they're not quite as

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:90%
big as the pyramids in Egypt.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.129 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, only
the Cahokia Mound

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
is as big as the Great Pyramid.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
largest mound site.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Some are very small,
only like a little hill.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
You'd barely even
recognize it, sometimes

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:84%
with giant trees growing
right up the middle of it,

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
so they know that these
had been very, very

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
old to support a multi-hundred
year old oak tree

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:84%
growing up over the middle
of it, with some of the roots

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
even coming down into
the grave artifacts.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a kid, I
would go to the Smithsonian

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:90%
in Washington DC.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a great museum.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just amazing.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But I always wondered
what's down in the basement?

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they have
hidden away down there?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there are
bones of giants hidden away

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.094 align:middle line:90%
at the Smithsonian?

00:22:00.094 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, remember at the
end of "Raiders of the Lost

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Ark"--

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The very last scene,
they showed the giant warehouse

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
with crates upon crates--

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a lot of
great things in there.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They have
some kind of warehouses

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
there with some of these
artifacts stashed away.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:10%
But there are also stories
in the 19th century,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:10%
they would come back with some
of these crates of giant bones

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and other out of place
artifacts and just dump them

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.127 align:middle line:10%
in the Atlantic,
just get rid of them.

00:22:25.127 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's tragic.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.558 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's terrible.

00:22:27.558 --> 00:22:30.645 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
law against archeology.

00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You never destroy the evidence.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is good evidence
that the Smithsonian

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
did that in Smithsoniangate.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you've ever
been to the Smithsonian,

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:90%
let's take you a quick tour.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The problem
in America is,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to research
this particular subject,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:90%
is the lack of bones.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Where are the bones?

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Everyone keeps asking us that.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.202 align:middle line:84%
So me and Jim and Ross
are actually on a mission

00:22:54.202 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to try to find some of these
bones and skeletons and teeth.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're hoping some
are going to come forth.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.825 align:middle line:84%
But in the hundreds of reports,
literally hundreds of reports,

00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
it ends by saying the
bones have been taken away

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
by the Smithsonian for
further investigation.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they never get
heard of again.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that was from
a conference, of course.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't show us the
underground basement

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.442 align:middle line:90%
of the Smithsonian.

00:23:18.442 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there
are pictures of that.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Are there?

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.671 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Except for
the end of "Raiders

00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Lost Ark," and of
course, that's fictionalized.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Hollywood.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:90%
They made that up.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:90%
No, there are no pictures of it.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a shame.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It is.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a great moment of history
that we could be examining.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, Smithsonian
should have a huge display case

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
in their museum with
one of these giants

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
with an interpretive
gallery showing

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
some of these incredible
artifacts that

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
have been found with the giants,
which are almost equally as

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:90%
impressive.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a staff of
scientists at the Smithsonian

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.974 align:middle line:84%
working away at
projects like this?

00:23:57.974 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
they were certainly

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th and 20th century
coming into some of these dig

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
sites and basically having
the rank to take over the digs

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and say we're going to bring
these back to Washington DC

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and do further examination.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And even PhD professors
of archeology

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:84%
who were working on these digs
would inquire and never find

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:90%
them ever again.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
A hobby store here
in the United States

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
has been fined $3 million by
the United States government,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
because they purchased artifacts
from the Iraqi war of Sumerian

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:90%
tablets and things like that--

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.860 align:middle line:84%
tablets that I'm
convinced were what

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin, the
late Zecharia Sitchin,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:84%
looked at when he made up
his theory about the Annunaki

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
visiting this planet.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And we saw how
Zecharia got knocked

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
by so many other researchers.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But isn't he
being vindicated now?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So much of his
research has come true.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an ancient
map called Piri Reis that

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
was given around to people
hundreds of years ago,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
which shows the south pole
before the ice covered

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
it, which is an amazing
story all by itself.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.944 align:middle line:84%
Researcher Graham Hancock has
done some work in that arena.

00:25:23.944 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK:
And as Piri Reis

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:10%
himself told us, that knowledge
was not his knowledge.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:10%
It was knowledge that
he borrowed and copied

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.090 align:middle line:10%
from earlier maps.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:10%
And he stated on
the map that it was

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:10%
based on more than
20 source maps,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:10%
and that some of
these maps went back

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:10%
to the time of Alexander
the Great or even earlier.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:10%
In other words, to before
the time of Christ.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:10%
So the mystery is, where did
the source maps come from?

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:10%
Who charted the globe long
ages ago with an accuracy

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:10%
that we ourselves can
hardly match today?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This map, of
course, is a great mystery,

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
because you could only make it
from looking at it from above.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it was
created around 1513?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And as Graham mentioned,
from other source maps,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and showing islands in
Antarctica that are now

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.104 align:middle line:90%
completely covered in ice.

00:26:20.104 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
How did they have
this knowledge--

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.519 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --in 1513?

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
earliest discoverers

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
in this modern age,
which were whalers going

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
down there in the
early 19th century,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
seeing the landmass of
Antarctica for the first time.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking obviously
about some lost information

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:84%
here in the form of
maps and what Antarctica

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.514 align:middle line:90%
looked like before the ice.

00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So much has
been lost on this planet.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And today, though, we
have a number of countries

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
down there in the South Pole
researching and doing work,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
not collectively,
but individually.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Russians are down there.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Japanese are there.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.266 align:middle line:90%
We're down there.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
What are we all
doing down there?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The Nazis were
down there pre-World War II.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.969 align:middle line:84%
It's the great mystery
of our time, George.

00:27:06.969 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
What is going down there?

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.777 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we ought to
do a field trip

00:27:09.777 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and figure it out for ourselves.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if indeed
there is a massive UFO,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like the size of what
we saw in the movie

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
"Close Encounters
of the Third Kind"

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
down there, whether
it stayed or got stuck

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:26.669 align:middle line:84%
or who knows what happened, but
that's what they're looking at?

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: These images
have been leaks

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of years now.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to make it
to the above ground media,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:90%
but I saw them around 2012.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I had a source in Europe
who worked for the Secret

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Service, the version
of that in the EU,

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
who has given me source photos
for my book "Future Esoteric."

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
seeing these images

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
in the ice that are now
coming out as quite common--

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
what all of these elite are
going down there to see,

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:90%
what Patriarch Kirill--

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry was there
on election day--

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.558 align:middle line:84%
you'd think he'd
have better things

00:28:01.558 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to do when the election
was happening-- going down

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
to see what they're calling
the Illuminati Disneyland.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.854 align:middle line:84%
Some major artifacts that are
down there that you could see.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Even Prince Harry with
a couple of his buddies

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
went cross-country
skiing out to see it.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cleft in the
ice, and you can see

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.391 align:middle line:90%
this giant craft underneath it.

00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.384 align:middle line:84%
Or a meteor strike or something,
an asteroid hit down there.

00:28:22.384 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Something
hit down there,

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:84%
but according to
Wilcock and Goode,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:84%
it's buried on top of
tropical trees and pineapples

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and different kinds of plants
that could only have grown

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:90%
in a tropical environment.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So now the thinking
is perhaps this

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
has something to
do with Atlantis.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe during a pole
shift, it shot down

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the mid-Atlantic ridge and ended
up in the south pole region.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this planet was
so different a long time ago.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of
major Earth changes

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:84%
could have affected it
and things like that.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We have done a lot of research
in the area of hobbits.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about
giants, but what

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:90%
about really little people?

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And this is what
I find equally fascinating.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:10%
Just finally, in April of
2017, the magazine "Nature"

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:10%
came out with an expose
of the Flores hobbit.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.314 align:middle line:10%
Flores is an island in Indonesia
and not too far away from Java.

00:29:23.314 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how tall
are these hobbits?

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Just over 3 foot tall.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're half the
size of us, George.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a full grown male
half the size of us.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
What was so interesting
about that article, though,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
they said they're not related
to human, that they branched off

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
of Homo habilis
millions of years

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:90%
ago into their own species.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if humans
have done the same thing?

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:84%
What if we've taken little
bits of some of these extinct

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
species, kept them, and
just in the same way

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that the African giraffe
has now been reclassified

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.615 align:middle line:90%
as four different species--

00:29:58.615 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.161 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You could barely tell
the difference looking at them

00:30:02.161 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:90%
at the zoo or down in Africa.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:90%
What if humans are the same way?

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:84%
What if we are all these
different species in one?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're going to look
at a major reclassification

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of who we really are
in the human race.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you, Brad, about our planet?

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
If all this is
correct, if we've had

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
giants, if we've had little
people, what does this mean?

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Clearly that
habitable life on this planet

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is much, much older than
we've given it credit for.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there are other
species beyond Homo sapiens

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that have lived here, sometimes
intermating with Homo sapiens,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and some of those traits
are now in our DNA.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
at an amalgamation

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:84%
of many different
species in one when

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you look at the whole of
the human race right now.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you weigh Earth-bound

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.522 align:middle line:90%
to extraterrestrial?

00:31:00.522 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's
the great question.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
evidence is lacking.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps this Antarctica
find could draw it all together,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that we can completely flip the
script on this and say, look,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:90%
we've got the craft.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:90%
We've got the entities.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
They're coming
from below the ice.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:90%
They're obviously ancient.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's get some DNA
testing going on,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and then find out that
they really are different.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What I don't get is why
governments are holding back.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a great
discovery to be

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
able to announce to
the world, this planet

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.760 align:middle line:90%
had giants a long time ago.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%
They were 10 feet tall.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:90%
They were 20 feet tall.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
they originated from,

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:90%
but they were on this planet.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where they are,
but why the shroud of secrecy?

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I guess it would
still be the shroud of secrecy

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
over the ET enigma,
that we've been visited

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:90%
in the past and the present.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's all being covered up.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same
line of, let's just

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
give the people little tidbits
of what's really going on,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
not the big picture.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the big picture
would include all of this,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and it would also
include ET visitation.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the elite think
we're not quite ready for that

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think, with the research

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that you've done
in this arena, will

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:84%
be one of the most startling
things that are uncovered

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and presented as fact?

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, if we can get
one of these giants fully intact

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.535 align:middle line:84%
with skin, with organs, with
the brain size, that we can--

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, in ice
or something like that?

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the
mammoth that they found?

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.638 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even find
out what they'd

00:32:40.638 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:90%
been eating in their stomach.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this scared 19th
century scientists.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
People were very
superstitious 100 years ago.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And to find one of these giants
with the double row of teeth

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that made no sense at
the time, maybe only

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.547 align:middle line:84%
some references in
the Bible to go by,

00:32:57.547 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it would have been a
lot easier just if you were

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
an upper management person
at Smithsonian to say, well,

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.600 align:middle line:90%
we're not talking about that.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.984 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to bring this up.

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's get rid of that.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Then, of
course, in 1990, you

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have a new law of the
federal government, which

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:90%
protects the grave rights.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So now Native
Americans can come in

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and claim any of the
skeletons, any of the artifacts

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:90%
as being their own.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's hands off.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.609 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's hands off.

00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Even if they show
Caucasian features--

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
red hair is common in some of
these giants, the tall stature,

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
the fair skin--

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans can
say they're ours.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.539 align:middle line:90%
You can't study them.

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to rebury them,
just like the Kennewick Man

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:90%
in Washington state.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an
organization devoted

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to investigating the
possibility of giants?

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Anything organized out there?

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A few of our friends
from Contact in the Desert--

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins
does some research.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.540 align:middle line:10%
We saw Hugh Newman.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Brien Foerster is doing research
on the elongated Paracas

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:90%
skulls--

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:90%
obviously non-human.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
cranial capacity, which

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:84%
is 30% larger
cranium than humans,

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
you can't just press on
the cranium as a child

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and create more capacity.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
You can deform the
skull, but it's

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.315 align:middle line:84%
going to have the
same brain size.

00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:22.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:22.115 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: These skulls
clearly not human.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a small
museum in Paracas, Peru

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
that displays them, sometimes
with patches of red hair

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:90%
still on them.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.491 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a
different species altogether.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
know Gaia has been

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.260 align:middle line:84%
doing an ongoing investigation
about the creatures

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and bones and skeletons
found at Nazca

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, which was the basis of
it Erich von Daniken's "Chariot

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods."

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:84%
And again, how interesting
it is for Erich

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to write things about
the Nazca Lines,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
right, that you could
really only see from above.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And then have the possibility
of these species popping up

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:90%
in tombs in areas--

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
it's an amazing
story all by itself.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Something happened on this
planet, Brad, a long time ago.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.390 align:middle line:84%
We just need to put
those pieces together.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:84%
What will be the breakthrough in
terms of the search for giants?

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:90%
What could happen?

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, what
we need is a specimen

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:10%
to fully vet and verify
and collect DNA samples

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:10%
and x-rays from.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.915 align:middle line:10%
That would be the smoking gun
if we could come up with one.

00:35:31.915 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Not just the bones,
but I think the flesh

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:10%
and the organs would
be fantastic to have

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:10%
that in our disposal.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about how many
hundreds, perhaps thousands

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of these giants that have been
uncovered around the world,

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:90%
there's got to be a few left.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would hope so.

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Maybe we can all
find a fresh mound that

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been disturbed and go
in there with all the science

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that we have today,
completely scan the mound

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:84%
before we go in there,
get down to the skeleton

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and the artifact
level, and just verify

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.245 align:middle line:90%
everything along the way.

00:36:06.245 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, how do
people track your work?

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.931 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You could find
me at bradolsen.com

00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
or cccpublishing.com, if you
want to see the books I write.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I also have a YouTube channel
called Esoteric Series.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And my book "Future Esoteric"
and "Modern Esoteric,"

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.652 align:middle line:84%
which has a lot of information
about the giants in it,

00:36:24.652 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:84%
available at
bookstores everywhere.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Always a
pleasure, George.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
fascinating subject,

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the search for
giants who may have

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:84%
roamed this planet a
long, long time ago,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
but do they continue
to roam this planet?

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe time will tell.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
