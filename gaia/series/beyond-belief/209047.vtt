>>GEORGE NOORY: What did you do?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Was there some
individual that was sick,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and you touch them, and
all of a sudden they're OK?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CANDACE SILVERS: Yes.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They had cut out the
piece in his heart

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and replaced it
with a pacemaker.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And after four or five sessions
with him, all of his bloodwork

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.347 align:middle line:90%
came back normal.

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:90%
All the lesions were gone.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.642 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they in shock?

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: When I
touch you, if you

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
have any kind of a block or a
disease, you'll feel a shock.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I can either teach this
all to you intellectually,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand
every bit of it.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of six weeks,
you will not be able to heal.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you can allow
me a few moments

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
of confusion and nonsense while
I take you beyond your senses.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the first
call or the last call?

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: For some
people, I'm the first call.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:90%
For most, I'm the last call.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Candace Silvers is
with us, a healer

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
who has studied with
teachers and healers

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:10%
from all over the planet.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
She's the founder of the
Silvers Healing Academy.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Candace is based in
Austin, Texas, right?

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I am now, yes.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen the
bats under the bridge yet?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I haven't, but I've
heard great really fun things

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I had an event in Austin
several years ago.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we toured that
bats under the bridge.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a vampire movie.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's good to
have you with us.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It's fun to be here.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.083 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of
mystical healing?

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I can't say
I got involved with it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.905 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to more say it
got involved with me.

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It found you.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I was born with
the ability to heal people.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.087 align:middle line:10%
And it scared me until I
got a sense of what it was.

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Because I would touch
people, and they

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:10%
would tell me that they felt
better or certain ailments

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:10%
went away.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And only until the coincidences
became familiar enough

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.534 align:middle line:10%
to understand, I did have
something to do with it,

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:10%
was I willing to look.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to travel
all over the world studying

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
with different masters and
healers in Marrakesh and Kenya

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and Thailand and Indonesia and
India and Tulum, everywhere.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And meeting with
Maasai warriors,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and starting to see the
similarities in this kind

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of tap beyond the veil
multi-dimensional capacity

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
what I started to notice is
our cultural world, first world

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:90%
kind of theories and themes.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Pushed it out.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Wouldn't look at it.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Weren't interested
in the opportunity.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So I began to become
really interested

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:90%
in sharing it with people.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how did it
first happen for you, though?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
When this ability came
to you, what did you do?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Was there some
individual that was sick,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and you touch them, and
all of a sudden they're OK?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yes.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, it was
frightening for me.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought they were
playing with me or kidding or--

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%
well, I didn't do that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what possessed you
to even try something on them?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I was born
with this deep desire

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to see what else there was.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And I've spent my life--

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been a human behavioral
specialist for the last 31

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I do retreats all
over the world.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I now have my academy,
where we train--

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.603 align:middle line:90%
I'm in 19 countries now and 34--

00:03:30.603 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --states in
America, and I think

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
five providences in Canada.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
We've trained doctors
all over the world.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And the interest, the intrigue
is how people won't look.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're not interested until
they have a direct experience.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And the minute that they
physiologically feel it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and are inspired by,
wait, what was that?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:10%
Now, I have their attention.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I meet a lot of people
because they have cancer,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
or because they have arthritis,
or because their back is out,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or they're having
their knee replaced.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But they then bring their
family members and friends.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
to find out more.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
My interest in the
academy is more--

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
the first level of
my academy is just

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to get people to become
multidimensional.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.447 align:middle line:84%
Because our world is very right,
wrong, here, there, up, down.

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It really
doesn't have an adjustment

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:90%
for beyond what I know.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
That kind of statement inspires
people but then scares them

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:90%
as they move toward it.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
My job is to get
them to see what's

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
possible beyond what they know.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I say, if you touch a wall
and it starts to move,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:90%
keep pushing.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep pushing till
you see where it goes.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the person
who is being healed

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
is having this
application done to them,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
must they be a believer?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Must they understand it?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: No.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I also do remote healings.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm hired to do remote
healings all over the world.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Someone can push it out.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, what if
you were going to heal me,

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and I said, ah Candace,
it's not going to work.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, that's
the fun is you can feel it.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it going to work?

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I have developed
many different technologies

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the greatest facets
for me is the ability to--

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
when I work on you, you feel
heat or tingling or pressure,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:90%
you can feel cold air.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You feel things
moving around in you.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So you and I are having a
direct experience together.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: My hands feel
what your body is feeling.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can say, I'm
working in your belly,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going in your head.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go down into
your heart or your lungs.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm doing that,
you're experiencing it with me.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's not hocus-pocus
or intellectual.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.882 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual direct
experience that's being had.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal
with chakras at all?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I do.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I do chakra balancing.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many chakras
do we have in our bodies?

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Oh, there are
multitudes of different levels

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and layers of chakras if you're
going into the causal body.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But the seven main chakras
that hold us together,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
I can balance all of them.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you sleep
better and eat better

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and feel better and think less.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, speaking
of balancing chakras,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
in Gaia's television
series "Microdose,"

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
they talk about balance,
very good perspective.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It is said by experts that
out of balance chakras can

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
manifest as physical illnesses
or emotional imbalances when we

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
are not in alignment with
our life experiences.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: The
chakras are not able to roll.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:10%
And that stuck the chakras,
and it becomes an illness.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Sick.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:10%
So every process that we
think is something bad that

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:10%
is happening to us is not
because someone is sending that

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:10%
to us.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are stuck in
the process of not understanding

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:90%
why we choose this experience.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you balance a
chakra once its energy has

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
gotten blocked,
stagnant, or too open?

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are many ways
to correct these imbalances,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
including meditating on
the out-of-balance chakra,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
eating foods that are of
the same color or vibration,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
using tuning forks or
other instruments that hold

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the same frequency
of the chakra.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Working on stuck emotions
in the area of the chakra.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Doing certain yoga,
Tai Chi, or qigong

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
practices that stimulate
the energy of the chakra.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Using herbs or essential oils.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Getting a reflexology,
acupuncture,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:90%
or Reiki session, and more.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:10%
There are also
numerous studies that

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:10%
show the efficacy of
energy-healing practices

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:10%
related to the chakras.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
In one early 1980s
study, therapeutic touch

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
an energy healing technique,
where the practitioner places

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
their hands on or near the
patient to balance the chakras

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%
was put to the test.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:10%
Dr. John Zimmerman used
a superconducting quantum

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:10%
interference device at the
University of Colorado School

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:10%
of Medicine in
Denver and discovered

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:10%
that a huge pulsating
biomagnetic field emanated

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:10%
from the hands of a
therapeutic touch practitioner.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:10%
The biomagnetic
pulsations from the hands

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:10%
swept back and forth
through the full range

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:10%
of therapeutic
frequencies, thus,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:10%
being able to stimulate healing
in any part of the body.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
tap into, Candace,

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to develop this kind
of energy healing?

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I'm going beyond our
intellectual conceptual mind,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
where think of a
two-year-old baby.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They're completely involved in
everything we're involved in,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
know anything yet.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So they actually have
more access than we do.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
The more we understand,
the less access we have.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:47.177 align:middle line:84%
Where it's a derivative of the
mind repeating and recognizing,

00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
re-cognizing, not
cognizing, connecting to.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:90%
But seeing what it knows to see.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
When you can go beyond what
you know, you can tap in.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have a six-week
course, for instance.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And in that six-week
course, I teach people

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
how to go beyond their minds,
how to tap into something.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini, create fire
and heat in the body.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Bring it through their hands
and be able to heal people.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So within six weeks, you can
put your hands on a camera

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
or in another human being
and be in another place

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm in me.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm in you.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm extrapolating.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:90%
So what are we tapped into?

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the intellect needs
to know what we're tapped into,

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:90%
it's still in the intellect.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:10%
When you're willing to lay down
the mind and pick up the heart

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:10%
and have an activity occur that
your mind can't capitulate,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:10%
you've gone beyond your mind
because the direct experience

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:10%
of the feeling and the emotion
and the heat and the connection

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and the occurrence
with the person you're

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:10%
working on communicating
that they're feeling it

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:10%
and experiencing it, you know
you've gone beyond yourself.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Where have we gone?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.755 align:middle line:90%
I can't answer that.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you ever feel
exhausted after an event?

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It's
exactly the opposite.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.665 align:middle line:90%
It brings you energy.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:04.465 align:middle line:90%
My healers--

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It energizes.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --experience
so much more energy.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See Edgar
Cayce used to have

00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:90%
the opposite effect on him.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It ended up killing him.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
He did too many trances
and readings for people.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:90%
But for you, you get energized.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Absolutely.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning when my
healers are in training,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
it takes a lot of practice
in your consciousness

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%
to lay your mind down.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So doing a 15-minute
healing requires

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.920 align:middle line:90%
a lot of concentration.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
you get used to it.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:10%
And you're actually, while
you're working on someone else,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:10%
not in yourself.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.723 align:middle line:84%
So you actually get to go
free for that period of time.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not worried
about yourself.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.598 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking
about yourself.

00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Your self isn't there.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You're connected to another,
creating healing, love, joy,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%
light in another.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
growing yourself.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the
movie "Green Mile"?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I did.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John Coffey who
was a healer in prison

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:84%
would touch people
who were sick.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But right at the end of it,
whatever ailment they had,

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
these horrible wretched
flies would come flying out.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And he would suck
them into his body.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
He would literally take
the cancer out of somebody.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And it would go within himself.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen to you?

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: No,
it's not organized

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
through my
consciousness that way.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if
you have a disease,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
it's something neurological
going on pathologically

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
from a historical point of view
in you that got out of order.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
When you ignored it because
you didn't understand it,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and there was no cultural
manifestation of a tool

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.067 align:middle line:84%
to help you reorganize it,
it gets caught in the body.

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't get
caught in the body,

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:90%
because you're a bad person.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It gets caught in the body,
because we live in life school.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're here on this planet
to learn about ourselves

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
through ourselves
with ourselves.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So when someone comes
to me with a disease,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cancer or a bad
back, it's my job to find it,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
dislocated it so then it just
goes back into the ethers

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
from whence it came.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't attach
to something else

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:90%
that's not interested in it.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what you do.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a video of you
with one of your clients,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.475 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, dealing with what she had,
I think chronic breast cancer.

00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%

had breast cancer.

look at that session.

And with her authority,
of course, and yours,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:90%

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.155 align:middle line:90%
Let's just check your movement.

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:30.955 align:middle line:90%

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.458 align:middle line:90%

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:90%

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.399 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.954 align:middle line:90%
Oh don't cry.

00:13:39.954 --> 00:13:40.754 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
How long has that
hole been there?

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, don't talk.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:90%
You almost didn't come.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> My first surgery.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And every year I go and they hit
it, I just shoot off the table.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.645 align:middle line:90%
Sistah, brotha.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.453 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Can you
imagine if this

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:90%
were just normal in our world?

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was an amazing
healing you just did on Lisa.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
How long ago was that?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Last
June of '21, yes.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when she came
to you, how bad was she?

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, I
believe she had been

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
cancer free for seven years.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But from the surgery, she
was left in terrible pain.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And it took me, as you
saw, about 20 seconds

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:90%
to take that pain away.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was your
goal to eradicate the pain

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:90%
that she was suffering.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.525 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Oh no, no.

00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
It takes me about 15 minutes
to do a full-body healing.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So very often, they'll
have pain in their lower

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
back or their neck.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's caused by
another place in the body.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So very often when I'm
doing a full-body healing,

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on about
80 different points.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find
blocks, let's say,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
in the ankle that is causing
the back of the neck to hurt.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:90%
So when I got to her breast--

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that's just one of the points--

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that's where we found it.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know she had had cancer
surgery seven years earlier

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.952 align:middle line:90%
until we found them.

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She looked
scared when you

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.473 align:middle line:84%
were touching, because she's had
bad times with other doctors.

00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, also,
when I touch you,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
if you have any kind of a block
or a disease or a dis-ease,

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
you'll feel a shock--

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to feel that.

00:15:32.456 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: --coming out of me.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And so
it shocks the body.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.607 align:middle line:90%
Then I do the healing.

00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I touch it
again, and it's cleared.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So not only is the pain gone,
there's no shock anymore.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, through
the great technology

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of Gaia and Zoom, we're going
to Iowa to talk to Lisa.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yes.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lisa, how are you?

00:15:50.135 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And congratulations, we're so
glad things are better for you.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.245 align:middle line:90%
It's truly an honor.

00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Proud to be here.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On a 1 to 10, before
you saw Candace, with 10 being

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:90%
the worst, how did you feel?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Before you saw her?

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a pain.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:10%
I did not feel it like just
in the normal day-to-day

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:10%
activities.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It was something that if
you hit it just right,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
or you palpated it, like my cat
would do-- my cat would always

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
jump on me and knead on me,
it would send me into orbit.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So would you say
your pain level was at 8?

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> 9 approaching 10 if
it was hit correctly.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And after the
healing with Candace,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
that level dropped to what?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it was gone.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 0?

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It was gone.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No pain?

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> 0.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And then after the healing,
I just kept feeling it.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
There was both the
scar from the incision

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and then under my
arm, where they

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
took a sentinel node was another
area where it kind of would

00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
go in.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought,
well, maybe they just--

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
it was an adhesion.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
And when Candace
did the healing,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember feeling the most
subtle but beautiful warmth.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And Candace, I don't know
if you remember, I said

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:90%
did you touch me?

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And I opened my eyes.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, no,
I didn't touch you.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Because what I felt was a pop.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
I can describe it

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is if you had like an
air bubble inside you.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was popped.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pop.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what I felt. So
when she went to palpate it

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
again after the healing, and I
was so hesitant, I was in awe.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I just kept pushing.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And like you saw in
the video, it's gone.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I still check
it all the time.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it seems like you
and Candace both got pretty

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%
emotional after the fact.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
What made you go to
her in the first place?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm a student of hers.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I took the Silvers Healing
a couple of years ago.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So I was joining her and
several others on a retreat

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:90%
out in Montana.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And part of that retreat
is she offers a healing

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:90%
to everybody in attendance.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was my turn.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And as the student,
I knew all the places

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:90%
she was going to hit.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, I was
already anticipating

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
when she came to the breast.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought, my scar is exactly
where she's going to push.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now you
feel 100% better?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, when
my cat still jumps up,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I still kind of cover myself.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm conditioned
to having it hurt.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And there's no pain anymore.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
are cancer free?

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been cancer free
for eight years now.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's got
to be a relief, huh?

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great relief.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I understand
your husband is a doctor?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> He is.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
he feel about this?

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> He's from Malaysia.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've had some really
good discussions about it.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And he says in Malaysia,
there's a lot of healers.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
To know which ones
are authentic is hard.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But he says, does
it really matter?

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Does it really matter what it
is if the person feels better?

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What advice
would you give

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.635 align:middle line:84%
to people who might be on the
fence about energy healing,

00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:90%
the healing that Candace does?

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.438 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:46.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, what do
you have to lose?

00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Give it a try.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
What I found fascinating, and
when I do healings on people,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I love the magic of it.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Candace says a lot.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
She said, do you want
to watch some magic?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I think part of the awe
is seeing other people

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
watching them get a healing and
seeing their expressions when

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:90%
the pain goes away.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty incredible.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think her
abilities are God-given?

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us who
are called to healing,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
that ability in us.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The thing is we just
don't believe it.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yet.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Candace--

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yet.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what do you
have to say to Lisa?

00:20:36.578 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I'm just so honored.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Isn't she lovely?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.673 align:middle line:90%
She's so beautiful.

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
talking about earlier.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You get involved
with your clients.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this
thing you do and leave.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
You want to hear
a couple of days

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
later how they're still
doing, and six months later,

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and a year later.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's really beautiful
to watch someone

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
for all those years in that kind
of pain not be in pain anymore.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fantastic.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, you have set
up a not-for-profit.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 2012 I
started a non-profit

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:90%
called My Happy Place.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And My Happy Place does bedroom
makeovers for sick kids.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I think after
my brush with cancer,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and I lost both my
parents to cancer,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that it was a catalyst to start
a sister organization called

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:90%
My Happy Haven.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And My Happy Haven
does bedroom makeovers

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.808 align:middle line:90%
for women with cancer.

00:21:32.808 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find the foundation?

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
How do they find it?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.543 align:middle line:10%
>> www.MyHappyPlaces.org.

00:21:41.543 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And we've modeled what we've
done so we can start affiliates

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:10%
in other areas.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are now nine affiliates
in six different states.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:90%
So we want to keep growing.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stay cancer free,
and stay pain free, huh?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.588 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Lisa.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:03.481 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
You take care of yourself.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
How many success stories
like this do you have?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Thousands.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Candace, what
would happen to this planet

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
if we had a million Candace
Silvers all over the place?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: That's my commitment.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
That is my commitment.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe we should have a
healer in every home or hut

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.387 align:middle line:90%
or bungalow or street corner.

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I believe
that anyone can heal.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I've trained
hundreds and hundreds

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of people, doctors, housewives,
veterinarians, yoga teachers.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:84%
All these Reiki masters
come to me to learn this.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful to
watch that in 6 weeks,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:90%
they're multidimensional.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And they know they are.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And they can do it.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And their minds melt.
And they get so excited.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And they touch
everyone they know.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
Coke song, I want

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:90%
to teach the world to sing.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to teach
the world to heal.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It would be a wonderful thing.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Instead of coming together,
we've begun to come to gather.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And we come to find out that
there's more than we thought.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Why is it just because
we haven't learned yet

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't exist?

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.422 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does it work?

00:23:15.422 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: The healing?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, people
come to take my academy.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.052 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing
I do in week one

00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:10%
is I tell them they're
not going to learn

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:10%
anything intellectually.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:10%
And they all get disgruntled
and upset, because they think--

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:10%
and I say, I can either teach
this all to you intellectually.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand
every bit of it.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of six weeks,
you will not be able to heal.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Or you can
allow me a few moments

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
of confusion and nonsense while
I take you beyond your senses.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to teach
you a particular chant

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and some physiological
movements that are going

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring heat through you.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And once you can do this, then
your mind catches up later.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The intellect will catch
up, but always later.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to be in
the light of the comet, not

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the tail.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
We see the tail of a
comet as a T-A-I-L.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But I see the tail of
a comet as a T-A-L-E.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a story we agreed to.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And we're stuck in that story.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And that story is
having us follow

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
what is instead of being
in the light itself,

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
which is unimaginable
and nonsensical and out

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:90%
of the ordinary.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Because we've never
been there yet.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And they learn how to do it.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they become enamored
with the fact that they can.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And every single time
you heal someone,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
your mind melts a
little bit more.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel the jolt
when you're touching somebody?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't
feel the jolt. They do.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Mm-hmm.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't just feel it
come back to you or anything?

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: My hands are far
more intellectual and brilliant

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:90%
than my mind.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
My hands feel everything
that's going on in your body.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And my hands, I can
do surgeries on you.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I can balance your chakras.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I can rearrange
things inside of you.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
During COVID, I
had to figure out

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%
immediately a new technology.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.915 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd only done healings
either remotely or in person.

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And everyone else
is running into their houses

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to protect themselves.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to figure out how
to get into the hospitals

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
to help the doctors, the
nurses, and the patients.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they accept
you or would they say, eh?

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: No, no, no.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work going
through a hospital.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But people called me
from all over the world--

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
because I have clients all
over the world-- and said,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
a family member's in
the hospital with COVID,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:90%
and they're dying.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, get a nurse to
get the phone into the hospital

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And the COVID nurse
would take the phone in.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would do the healing while
they were in the hospital bed.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were coming
off the machines

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and coming out of the hospitals
and coming home healthy.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to have
people call me from all

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:90%
over the world that had COVID.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were at home very
ill, but not in the hospital.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot of different
difficulties from the virus.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to give
them their smell back

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and their tastes back.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:26:12.162 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And get
their brain fog gone.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing
to watch someone

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
who hasn't walked in five years
stand up and walk, or someone--

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
just anything.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Just help someone.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Figure out what they
need and give it to them.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the first
call or the last call?

00:26:29.643 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: For some
people, I'm the first call

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:90%
because they know me.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:90%
For most, I'm the last call.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.407 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I--

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
exhausted everything.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I think God calls
it growing pains, because--

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
we don't call it growing
joy, because it's

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
painful to go
beyond what we know.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:90%
But it is a knock on the door.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It is a calling to an
investigation that's

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
beyond what you
would have agreed

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
to spend your time on should
everything be going well.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so people learn that
things exist when they find out

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that the culture
that they live in

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the prototype
they're looking for.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't just give up.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They go looking beyond
what they've been taught.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How satisfying
is this for you

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:84%
when you see people like
Lisa that you've worked on?

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I don't have words.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I just have desire to do more.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't have words
to say that I meet

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:90%
someone I've never met before.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on them,
and their pain goes away,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and they feel better.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.288 align:middle line:84%
And the hug that we
give each other--

00:27:29.288 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you must
feel better about it.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Every time.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.257 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I could tell.

00:27:32.257 --> 00:27:36.468 align:middle line:84%
I could tell on the video that
it has changed you, hasn't it?

00:27:36.468 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I don't know
if it's changed me.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's consistently
changing me.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It is not something that you
get used to or you expect.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Some people heal right
away and some people, it

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:90%
takes several healings.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I was doing healings
yesterday in Austin, Texas.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman
who had had Lyme disease

00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:84%
for 21 years and more problems
from it than I could count

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and on so many
different medications.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.825 align:middle line:90%
And I did this healing on her.

00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Her healing was 50
minutes, not 15.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
The more ailments
they have, they'll

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:90%
just come for a longer time.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, she
got off the table.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was unbelievable
watching her experience.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't felt her
feet in 21 years.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't felt the ground.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't felt no pain.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And my watching her
have that experience,

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that there
is a house or a car

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.872 align:middle line:84%
or an experience that
you could have or get

00:28:33.872 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
or ascertain that's
better than that.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have taught,
Candace, about teaching people,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:90%
about training people.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Deborah King has studied several
of these modalities of healing.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
She was talking with our Lisa
Garr on Gaia's "Inspiration"

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:90%
show about the push to teach.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: So you saw her.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.703 align:middle line:84%
And you started a journey
on hands-on healing.

00:28:55.703 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DEBORAH KING: I did.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And that was a lengthy program.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:90%
It was four years long.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up staying
and teaching actually

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in that school for another
half a dozen years or so.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I also followed
ministers and priests

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and rabbis around for a
while and did my thesis

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.600 align:middle line:84%
on what kind of energy,
if any, they were Work

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:90%
with when they did healings.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
In all of these religions,
they do some sort of very quiet

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.150 align:middle line:90%
usually over in the side chapel.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They do some kind
of healing work.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: So these are things that
you study, that you research,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:90%
that you spent time with.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.563 align:middle line:90%
You weren't born with the gift.

00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't come from
the knock on the head.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I know.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: I love that.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I love the practicality.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it shows people
that every single person

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:90%
can do this.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Absolutely.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: --it might
not take 15 years.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:90%
It might.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what your
journey is, what your path is.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: What someone else might
take five minutes, really.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So every single one of us is
actually a natural-born healer.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We have all of this
information deeply

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%
embedded in our cellular memory.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've just
misplaced it slightly.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Culturally, we're under a
lot of pressure these days.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we forget we
have these talents.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take,
Candace, to train somebody,

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:90%
to teach them?

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Six weeks.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I have
seven different levels.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can continue
to study with me.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I just did a level 3 in
Palm Springs last month.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm teaching them
to use their mind as a steering

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:90%
wheel.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer
thought thinkers.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:90%
They're now causers.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are different levels
of intention that you can learn.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But the first
level in six weeks,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
you learn to become
multi-dimensional.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands on
someone and heal them.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's profound.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had
students that you just

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.852 align:middle line:84%
simply say to yourself,
whoa, are they learning?

00:30:50.852 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: All of them.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Lisa was one
that came that she's

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:90%
our poster child for disbelief.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:84%
She could not believe that
she was going to do it.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:84%
By week 3, they can all
feel heat in their hands.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Her mind was in the way.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was--

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.093 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:07.093 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: And she was so
sure that she was going to be

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
the one that couldn't.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I get giddy, because I
know that they will learn.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And I know that it will come.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just their minds
haven't melted yet.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:84%
They're still encapsulated
into a box of understanding,

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:90%
instead of standing under.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
By week 4, she began
to feel the heat.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:84%
By week 6, she was
initiated by me.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The minute you're initiated,
I put my energy into you.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You then can feel
the energy in you

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:90%
and gift it away to another.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
She then could do the healing.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And watching her cry, and
watching her mind melt,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%

medical and fighting people
to understand inclusion

causes them to come together.

And I believe that the
more you offer this,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:90%
the more people come.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:84%

The less people are afraid
of it, the more involved

they become.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not you.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:90%
You're not me.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But when we say
it's not out there,

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:90%
but instead it's in here.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been for you
the most frustrating aspect

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:90%
of what you do?

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It's very frustrating
when people don't believe.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.015 align:middle line:84%
People that believe
are very quiet.

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:38.815 align:middle line:90%
People that--

00:33:38.815 --> 00:33:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
the recipients--

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Don't
believe are very loud.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --or people on
the outside looking in?

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I don't care.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They come from everywhere,
especially on social media.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.508 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: They like
to hide and say things.

00:33:48.508 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't even
worry about social media.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But it's OK with me,
because I know that there is

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:84%
an interim space
when you watch--

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all haters.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Well, that's OK.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.827 align:middle line:90%
Hurt people, hurt people.

00:33:58.827 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:90%
They're letting they're hurting.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:90%
You have room for that.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a bridge in
between what I know

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and what I will know.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the people that I meet are
on the bridge, they've left--

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:90%
this is right, wrong.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:90%
And they're an investigation.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't understand,
or they don't believe,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.050 align:middle line:90%
like I said, I get giddy.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
I'm just crossing them

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.650 align:middle line:90%
across that bridge.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It's no different than
the bridge of your nose.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:84%
You're going from your
mind to your heart.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:84%
I teach all of my clients, you
want to keep your head down,

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:90%
your intellect, your heart up.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So that it's your heart
that's guiding, not

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
your own direct, personal,
historical knowledge.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So that you can
be an experiencer

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:38.703 align:middle line:84%
on this planet instead of a
repeater and an angry person

00:34:38.703 --> 00:34:39.870 align:middle line:90%
who says, I don't know that.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand that.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's
outside of my scope.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it doesn't work.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I truly am only interested
in what I don't know.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It calls me.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to see it.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:90%
I want to experience it.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I want to try it.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I've just started
working with crystals.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got
incredible medicinal powers.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: But I can
blow a crystal on you.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I can put my hands up
to your camera right now

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and heal the audience.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.680 align:middle line:84%
When I put my hands up
to you, you feel it.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be close.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
be in the same room.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So I can blow crystals,
whether we're in person here

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in the studio together,
or we're on Zoom.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have six or eight
different crystals next

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
to me that particular day.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.567 align:middle line:84%
And I'll blow
different crystals.

00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have
different properties.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.385 align:middle line:84%
And I can open different parts
of disease inside of you.

00:35:29.385 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the
name Uri Geller.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I have.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Uri Geller
is a mentalist.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And he's a great Israeli.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
He was on the
"Johnny Carson Show."

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They tried to trick him
and things like that.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But he was on my radio
show several years ago.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And he has these strange
powers about him.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And he told everybody
listening on the radio,

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
bring your dead
watches and clocks.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Hold it to the radio
and listen to me.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
go, work, work, work.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.140 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, Candace, I'm
getting emails from people

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.440 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet going
my watch that hasn't

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:90%
worked in 10 years is working.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: That's right.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My clock is working.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's jump ahead.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while,
we'll rerun a program

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
on the weekends and a special
segment called the "Best Of."

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We ran an Uri Geller show
where he did this experiment.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:90%
This is years later.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I open up my emails, and
I've got all these emails

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
from people saying
my clock's working.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
what was this for?

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it dawned on me
we reran that program.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He had the ability to
fix this even on tape.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yeah.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does this happen?

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.203 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Well, it does happen.

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You can watch one
of my live healings.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Instagram and
Facebook every week

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:90%
when I do live healings.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And you can watch them now.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And they're still healing you.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm healing you, and
there's 20 people in the room--

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Miraculous.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --everyone in the
room is having the healing.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Everyone in the room feels it.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Everyone goes through it.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people, their
mind is in the way.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So they'll say, I don't feel it.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And I don't get it.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.012 align:middle line:84%
And I say, that's OK,
because it's still working.

00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The sun doesn't need you to
believe in it for the sun

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:90%
to shine.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
tried this on children

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.822 align:middle line:84%
who really don't understand
what's going on at all?

00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I work on animals.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:90%
I work on children.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it works?

00:37:20.745 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I work on
babies with cancer.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.427 align:middle line:90%
And they go NED, yes.

00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yeah.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the most
heartening thing you've done?

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We saw one of course
just on video.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: You know, I can't.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Every human being,
every human body

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.957 align:middle line:90%
is its own miraculous state.

00:37:40.957 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you work with
someone, whether it's

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
a baby or in-vitro
or an older person

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
or help someone pass
into the next dimension,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:90%
it's miraculous.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:90%
When I do--

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --out-of-body

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:84%
There just isn't any point

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
or it's, when is my
day going to be over?

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing
with a human being

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.700 align:middle line:84%
who's blocked or clogged
and in pain somehow.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And you're watching them--

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've worked on a woman
who had had a miscarriage.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And while I was healing her,
she started crying blood.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I worked on people--

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I've worked-- I mean,
there's just so many.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's miraculous,
and it's every time.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's miraculous every time.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's never a
time where you say,

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, that
happens all the time.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
astronaut, Edgar Mitchell,

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:84%
put together the Institute
of Noetic Sciences.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to study all of this.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And he did a miraculous
job doing it.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Gaia News reported on
a new scientific study

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of energetic healing.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Energy medicine has always
been relegated to the realm

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of pseudoscience by the
mainstream scientific

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Recently, however, the Institute
of Noetic Sciences, or IONS,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
has sought to change that
by conducting a pilot

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.650 align:middle line:84%
study investigating the effects
of energy medicine treatments

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:90%
on pain reduction.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.800 align:middle line:10%
is focused on applying
scientific methods to studying

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:10%
consciousness and reality.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
He was the lead
author of the study

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.487 align:middle line:84%
and had this to say
about what motivated it.

00:39:21.487 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:10%
>>GARRET YOUNT: The
motivation for the study

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.900 align:middle line:10%
comes from the fact
that a lot of people

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.470 align:middle line:10%
experience benefit from
energy medicine modalities.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
understand why or how exactly.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the range of
different healing modalities,

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the treatment experience
varied with each practitioner.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:84%
For the intent of this
study, researchers

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
chose not to differentiate
between the modalities,

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:50.090 align:middle line:84%
rather assessing
them all as one.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.158 align:middle line:84%
>>YOUNT: So the range of types
of treatment, mostly no touch.

00:39:53.158 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:84%
There were a few of
the practitioners

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.290 align:middle line:90%
that did apply the light touch.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Most of them were silent.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of the practitioners
did vocalize.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Numerous outcome measures
were taken before, during,

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:90%
and after each session.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:90%
The results were promising.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>YOUNT: So the main
outcome of this study

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
was that pain
reduction was achieved.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So these folks did experience
relief from their pain.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing what
science is beginning to do.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.780 align:middle line:84%
What you've learned and
have done all your life,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
science is just
catching up to you.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.272 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, that's where
I decided to start the academy.

00:40:27.272 --> 00:40:30.160 align:middle line:84%
It was time that people stopped
seeing me as an anomaly,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.010 align:middle line:90%
or she's the one that can do it.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to teach--

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a miracle worker.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Well, we're
all miracle workers.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.494 align:middle line:84%
A mother giving birth to a
child is a miracle worker.

00:40:37.494 --> 00:40:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a miracle.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: It's a miracle.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you come
across many skeptics?

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Tons
all the time, yes.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you try
to change your mind?

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.213 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I am not
interested in changing a mind.

00:40:47.213 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
melting a mind.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has a skeptic come
to you and you heal them?

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.248 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Of
course, all the time.

00:40:53.248 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they walk away?

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I was working
on a gentleman, Ed.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.030 align:middle line:90%
He's probably 45 years old.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And I worked on him every
single day for five days.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I worked on him--

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I was so inspired.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: It was one hour,
but I worked for two hours

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.040 align:middle line:90%
some of the days.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
He came to me with
cerebral palsy.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.347 align:middle line:90%
And he was completely--

00:41:12.347 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
born with it, right?

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Born with it.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Or I believe he thought it
happened in the birth canal,

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:90%
but that's his--

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, some
people believe that.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: That he was
absolutely crippled

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and in the state that puts
you in and could not speak.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And his mother and
father came with him.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.484 align:middle line:90%
He was 45, but he--

00:41:35.484 --> 00:41:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and the father was an
unbelievable skeptic.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's all live
on my Facebook site.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:90%
You can go back and watch it.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.906 align:middle line:90%
I think two or three years ago.

00:41:43.906 --> 00:41:45.198 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a rude skeptic?

00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:45.998 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Huh?

00:41:45.998 --> 00:41:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a rude skeptic?

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: A quiet skeptic.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:49.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's quiet.

00:41:49.503 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: And by the
end of the five days,

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:54.190 align:middle line:10%
he saw his son laying out
flat on the table, all

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:10%
of his muscles were
stretched out normally.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.300 align:middle line:90%
His hips were back in place.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I opened up his brain and
put in an electrical socket

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:84%
so that it could feed the back
of the brainstem into the spine

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.120 align:middle line:84%
into the solar plexus down into
the hips and through the feet.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So that his body could talk
to his mind and his mind

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to his body.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And you see all of
that work each day

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that you come back
and see me working

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:84%
on him, and from day one what
he was like and in day 5.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.347 align:middle line:90%
And it's really--

00:42:26.347 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's traumatic.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --astounding
to get to be part of that.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And the father
gave me a huge hug.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ha, you
made him a believer.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: I don't know.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about--
look, I believe

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.410 align:middle line:90%
to believe you be and live.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Be, live-- you be and live.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.725 align:middle line:84%
What you believe,
you be and live.

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not interested
in changing your mind.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I think that's why we have war.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in offering
an opportunity that

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
allows an investigation
that allows someone

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to step across the bridge of
their nose from their two eyes

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:84%
into their third eye
where intuition prevails.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
true healing resides.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Candace?

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: candacesilvers.com.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.053 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple enough.

00:43:06.053 --> 00:43:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Candace
Silvers on Instagram.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Candace Silvers on Facebook.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Through Gaia, you
know, my shows on Gaia

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
have brought us so many
beautiful clients all

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's been really a
wonderful journey

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to meet a group of
people like you, where

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:84%
we have such a connective
experience of what's possible

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and want to feed the world.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you supplement
a lot and things like that?

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering what you
do to create this energy

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.257 align:middle line:90%
field around you.

00:43:39.257 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: I think if
you send kindness out,

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:90%
kindness comes back.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.460 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Karma.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: --when
anger meets kindness,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:84%
anger dissolves, or it goes away
and it looks for its own kind.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:43:53.115 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:57.727 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of people use
that technique on this planet.

00:43:57.727 --> 00:43:58.527 align:middle line:90%
We should.

00:43:58.527 --> 00:44:00.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERS: Well, I believe
if you take the figure 8

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.303 align:middle line:10%
and lay it down on its
side, and you make it

00:44:02.303 --> 00:44:04.460 align:middle line:10%
like those liquid Drano
commercials from the '80s,

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.750 align:middle line:10%
where they're see through.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And people come to me
in my private practice

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.338 align:middle line:90%
as a human behavioral expert.

00:44:09.338 --> 00:44:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, my
husband hates me,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.720 align:middle line:84%
or my daughter left me, or
my best friend thinks I lied.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.873 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them how
to send out love.

00:44:16.873 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come back, and for
their next session and say,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:90%
well, it didn't work.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:90%
They were still angry.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I say, well the
clog is still there.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Just keep sending out love.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And as the clog moves through,
love will eventually come back.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
it's too painful.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:30.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm nice, and they're mean.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, it's their
lips that are moving.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.030 align:middle line:10%
They're the ones that are
letting you know they're hurt.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They may be using your name,
but they're the ones speaking.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, anything they say is
giving you their consciousness.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.330 align:middle line:90%
You just keep sending out yours.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they will feel it.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The clog in between the
two of you will disperse,

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:90%
and love will come back.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And I have had the
great incredible gift

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:10%
of sitting in that chair for 30
some odd years helping people

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.592 align:middle line:10%
where it always works.

00:45:00.592 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, keep doing it.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERS: Yes.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Candace, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.085 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERS: Absolutely
a pleasure.

00:45:06.085 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The power
of energy healing,

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:10%
she's got it because I can
feel it glowing from her.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:10%
And you can too.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.720 align:middle line:10%
