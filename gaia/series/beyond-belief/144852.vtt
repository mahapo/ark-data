00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's hard to
believe that we are now

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
at the 70th anniversary
of the crash of Roswell,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico, an
amazing story where

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:10%
researchers like Don Schmidt
have been investigating

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:10%
for years now.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Don wrote the book, "UFO
Crash at Roswell," which

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
was turned into the movie
"Roswell," nominated

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
for a Golden Globe,
is with us to talk

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:90%
about the 70th anniversary.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.219 align:middle line:90%
70 years, Don.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DON SCHMIDT: 70
years, George, yes.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.926 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where does time go?

00:00:47.926 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, at least
we weren't around back then.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.809 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
what, I would have

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
liked to have been around back
then just to have witnessed

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes, I thought
of that myself at times.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But then to witness
as a child what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
so many of those
young people did

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
at that time, the
oppression, the intimidation

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that they witnessed
their fathers,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
their families live
through, over something

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was originally
explained away

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
as just the off-the-shelf
mundane weather balloon.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they
couldn't get through.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
As one of the officers'
sons said to us,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:84%
it was like living with
a father in a bubble

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:90%
that you couldn't break through.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It was always, don't
ask me about that,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I can't talk about
that, right up

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.447 align:middle line:84%
to the time they
finally passed away.

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don, give
us a quick overview

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.446 align:middle line:84%
of what you think may have
happened back in July of 1947.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Of course.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I always qualify my words,
my position, with the fact

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
that I was a skeptic.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would make a
single weekend jaunt down

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to New Mexico.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it was
the beginning of 1989.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And we thought we'd come away
with a balloon explanation

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
or something just as
conventional, just as prosaic.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And then we started to
speak to the people who

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
actually handled the material,
the wreckage, firsthand.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.069 align:middle line:84%
And we realized, my god, what
if they're telling us the truth.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk
about wreckage, we're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
summer of 1947.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And any of your
viewers could go back

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and check all the newspaper
accounts of that summer

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
wave of flying disk activity.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It was as though the
country was being invaded.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:10%
Banner headline after headline,
one day after another,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:10%
of even attempted
aircraft scrambles

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:10%
trying to bring one down,
trying to get something

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:10%
on camera, anything to explain
what was invading our air

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:10%
space at that time.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:10%
And New Mexico, which was the
heart of all military activity

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.985 align:middle line:10%
at that time--

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the country
was paranoid anyway.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.242 align:middle line:10%
So it was after the war.

00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHMIDT: It was just the
beginning of the Cold War.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:10%
It was just after World War II.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:10%
We had just detonated the first
atomic bomb in New Mexico.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And you had that very
squadron, the 509 Bomb Wing,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:10%
which had just dropped
the two bombs on Japan

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:10%
two years before, they happened
to be stationed at Roswell.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.159 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
violent thunderstorm

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
in the central High Desert
portion of New Mexico.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they get them.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: And they get them.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
remember when I was

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
at one of the
anniversaries of Roswell,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to fly me from
the Albuquerque airport

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.077 align:middle line:90%
on a little type of prop plane.

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Mesa Airlines, right.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I said,
no way, we're driving.

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Because you're
flying through the storm

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
in a small plane, as
opposed to over it.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And the ranchers
north of Roswell

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
described that between
the thunder claps

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
was a sound of
something different,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:90%
almost like an explosion.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was the next
morning that a ranch

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.215 align:middle line:10%
foreman by the name of
W.W. Mac Brazel rode out

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:10%
and he discovered it.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The rancher.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.085 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHMIDT: A rancher.

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And he discovers this
huge debris field

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:10%
of this bizarre, this strange
material that he had never

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:10%
seen before.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And he would report it
to the local sheriff

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell, Sheriff George
Wilcox, who in turn contacted

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:90%
the Roswell Army Air Field.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
The head intelligence
officer, Major Jesse Marcel,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
contacted their base commander,
Colonel William Blanchard.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And this material that
the rancher brought in so

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
impressed them, nobody
could identify it,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:90%
that he just didn't dispel--

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it have little,
funny hieroglyphs on it

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
and things?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.834 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: It had
hieroglyphic-like symbology

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that ran the struts, the
lengths of some of the material.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The material itself was
paper thin, practically

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:90%
weightless, larger sheets of it.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't dent it.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't bend it.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And the material that we still
refer to as our holy grail,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that it was the same
paper thin-like material.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:90%
But this you could crumble.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%
You could crease.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:90%
You could fold.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
You could wad it up.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But you'd place it down and
it would flow like water.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: It would
just smooth right out.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you wrote the
book, "UFO Crash at Roswell"--

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: With Kevin
Randall, correct.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which was
a dramatic book.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Kevin's been on Coast to
Coast with me numerous times.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.515 align:middle line:84%
It was turned into a
movie called "Roswell."

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> For more than six
hours in July of 1947,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
the town of Roswell was known
as the flying saucer capital

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Debris recovered from a
crash site in the desert

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
was originally identified by
Army intelligence officer Major

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Jesse Marcel as being
from a flying saucer.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But the party didn't
last too long,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
much to the embarrassment of
the Army and, in particular,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Major Marcel, shown
here holding what

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be a
piece of aluminum foil

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:90%
from a weather balloon.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that movie.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was so poignant
and so right on.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:90%
It tells your book--

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.309 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And it
names the names.

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in the
audio [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.849 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: It recreates.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It dramatizes.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were technical
advisers on the set as well,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
both the exteriors
in Bisbee, Arizona,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
as well as everything we filmed
as far as in northern LA.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And what was wonderful
was also the response

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
from the cast and crew, that
they wanted to be part of this.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They were proud to be part
of essentially breaking

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:84%
through this cloud of
mystery, presenting

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
what we at least knew based on
all the eyewitness testimony.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The guy with the
glasses with the white hair,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
who was he depicting?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: He was depicting
an older Major Jesse Marcel.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah ha.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Then
lieutenant colonel,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
who he was dying of
emphysema at the time.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was the
original fall guy.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
General Roger Ramey,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
at the Fort Worth
press conference,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
going up the chain of
command when they substituted

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the weather balloon with the
radar reflector kite wreckage

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
for the original material, and
he was ordered to pose with it,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
knowing full well
that it wasn't--

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember, he
was like stooped down.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I remember that picture.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.693 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --knowing
full well that it

00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
wasn't what he retrieved,
what he handled,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
what he saw, as far as
that massive debris field.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he was told, you know,
Jess, just be a good soldier.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Five years, 10 years, 15 years,
it's all going to come out.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.129 align:middle line:84%
Well it's 30 years
later, he's dying,

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and he realizes it's
not going to come out.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
going to come out.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
the frustration right

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.101 align:middle line:90%
in the movie on his face.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: As we asked
him to actually portray

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:90%
that level of frustration.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And he breaks his oath of
security and he comes out.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And he states, being
familiar with all materials

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
both foreign and domestic, this
was nothing made on this earth.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much
more profound do we

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
need to hear from somebody
regarding this incident?

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Brazel
found the wreckage,

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
was it totally
obliterated debris?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Or was there structure?

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Was there a craft
there that he saw?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what has always
confused me, Don.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: There were
three different sites all

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:90%
along the same trajectory line.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
The debris field, as Brazel
would describe, and then

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
as Marcel then being ordered
to go out and investigate

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
this first-hand, there
was a secondary body site

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
atop a bluff about 2 and 1/2
miles from the debris field.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And then along that trajectory
line much closer to Roswell

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:84%
was where the remains of
the craft and the crew.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what,
it broke apart,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and pieces would fall
as it moved along?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Correct.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There seemed to be, whether
it was struck by lightning

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
or an internal malfunction
that caused it to explode,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:90%
raining debris.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of
bodies were either ejected

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
or from the decompression.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the remains
of a capsule or a pod

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.412 align:middle line:84%
continued onward for
another 25, 30 miles.

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
we have witnesses

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.969 align:middle line:90%
to all of those locations.

00:08:58.969 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All those sites.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And the thing is
that what gave us away the fact

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
that something happened
much closer to Roswell

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
was that when you had the local
sheriff's department, as well

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
as the local fire department,
going north of town,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Roswell
Army Air Field,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
this was in their jurisdiction,
whereas Lincoln County, where

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
the debris field was
located, would not have

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:90%
been within their jurisdiction.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all the years you've
been investigating this, Don,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
what do you find to be, for
you, the most fascinating aspect

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of this case?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well,
first of all, the hunt

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
for the holy grail,
as we continue,

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
archaeological work.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.177 align:middle line:84%
We've had now five digs at
the debris field site as we--

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
still finding things?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: We are.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Our local geologist by
the name of Frank Kimbler,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:84%
who works in between
our projects,

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
has found a number of
remnants, metal-like material,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that when tested, when analyzed,
certain elements should not

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
be there.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a specific
hardening agent

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
that is used
specifically with steel.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet there it
is with aluminum.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is no such
registered, as far as alloy,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
anywhere on Earth
that we're aware of.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So we need to have these
samples analyzed, and then

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
duplicated effort
in other labs, which

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:90%
will be as far as exciting.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But sadly, but yet
also gratifying,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
are more and more of the
deathbed testimonies,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
admissible in a court
of law, the fact

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
that these people
are stating right

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
til their very last days that
this did happen, that this was

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
not a weather balloon, this
was nothing conventional

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
of any sort, that this was, as
that very first press release,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.924 align:middle line:84%
the recovery of a
crashed flying saucer.

00:10:54.924 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the bodies that they

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
talked about and the mortician
who is no longer with us,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Glenn Dennis?

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: The phone calls
that originated to the Ballard

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Funeral Home, already suggesting
that something significant had

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The base hospital,
in tracking down

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
some of the remaining doctors
and nurses, and the way

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
they were essentially
prevented from being

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%
involved with this incident.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Other doctors came
in, other nurses

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:90%
came in to the base hospital.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the nurses,
Rosemary McManus,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.335 align:middle line:84%
told us that clearly
something big had happened.

00:11:35.335 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they ordered little
children-sized coffins, right?

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.711 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And there
were phone calls

00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
that came to the funeral home
requesting child-sized caskets.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And Glenn Dennis, obviously
the reaction, my god, you

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:84%
had some type of incident
involving children.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, we just wanted to
have them on standby if that

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:90%
should ever be the case.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the meantime,
you have witnesses

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
describing the little
people, the little men.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:90%
What a story.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: As I kind
of got Walter Haut, who

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
was Colonel Blanchard's
public information officer,

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and I kind of tricked him.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.723 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, he's the one
who changed the story, right?

00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Or he fleshed it out.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
He finally revealed much
more of his involvement.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first ways
I kind of tricked Walter

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
into admitting much more is
I was sitting with Walter,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and we were just talking
as far as very socially

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%
about other things.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And all at once I said,
Walter, how tall did Butch--

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
which is what he always called
Blanchard, Butch, the old man--

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
how tall did Butch tell
you the bodies were.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And Waller's arm
shot out like that.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To show you a height.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.343 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: About a height
just above his shoulder.

00:12:51.343 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't
deny bodies, right?

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Right.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But he looked at me
like, you got me.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tricked me.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tricked me.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it opened
up more and more to the point

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that he provided
information that

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
became part of his
sealed statement

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
that he signed for
posthumous release.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And that way he could
feel that he still

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:90%
kept his word to Blanchard.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
He kept his word that
as long as he was alive,

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:90%
he never talked about this.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you were
talking about the debris field.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Back to the movie "Roswell"
for a little clip.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Think it could be Russian?

00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I sure hope not.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you try a cutting torch?

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
that all about, Don?

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.322 align:middle line:84%
It was as if they were talking
about a craft or something.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, I love that
scene because it gives a great

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
visual as far as where they're
trying to actually drill with

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:90%
a hardened drill bit through--

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the structure?

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Into a
piece of the wreckage.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And they can't even scratch it.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
All at once the bit snaps.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It flies across the room.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
going, is it Russian?

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it Russian?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And then they
remark, could it be?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And sure hope not, because
we're in trouble if it is.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very dramatic.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But it demonstrates
precisely what

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
the witnesses, whether
civilian or military,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
have described to us after all
these years, that this material

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:90%
was practically indestructible.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: What made
them change the story?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the original
radio broadcast

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
was that they had captured
a downed flying saucer.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, they actually
put out a press release.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And what one has to keep in mind
is that when the rancher first

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
brought some of the samples
into town, which was Sunday,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:84%
July 6th, as the base commander
going up the chain of command,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and it goes all the
way to Washington.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And General Clements
McMullin at the Pentagon

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
calls up and says, I want some
of that material immediately

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.442 align:middle line:90%
brought, flown out that evening.

00:14:56.442 --> 00:14:57.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:14:57.242 --> 00:14:58.042 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: So by Sunday
evening, July 6th,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Washington already has some
of the samples in hand.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
The press release doesn't
go out for another two days.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Tuesday, July 8th they announce
they captured a flying saucer,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but all with the intent of the
creation of this straw man.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
They build it up, also
then with the plan

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
they're going to tear it down.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So within five hours, they
have the weather balloon press

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:90%
conference with Major Marcel.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's all explained away.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
It was just a misidentification.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, George, it
was the first time

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in history, first and
only time in history

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that a weather balloon
was misidentified

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.425 align:middle line:90%
as a flying saucer.

00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Weren't they also concerned
about the Japanese launching

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%
balloon bombs?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But, my god, that
was two years later.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: It was
two years later.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the suggestion
that these Fugo balloon

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
bombs, these Japanese
balloon bombs, one

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
would then have to believe
that they were orbiting

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the planet for two
years before one

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
happened to come down
on that very ranch.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And this ranch was no
stranger to such recoveries.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They were constantly
retrieving balloons.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there were
typically tags specifically

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
instructing the finder where
to report this and rewards,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:90%
$5 to $10 for such devices.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.245 align:middle line:84%
There were no tags
within this debris.

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to
suggest this was--

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is new today
in terms of information

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
that's being released, Freedom
of Information Act documents?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Anything out there?

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: One of
the things that--

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and some of my colleagues, and
for all of their failed efforts

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
in finding documents,
I always point out

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that one of the major obstacles
we had with the Nuremberg

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
trials regarding as far as all
the captured Nazis was there

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%
was very little paper trail.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing that
they could put their finger

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
on as to, this is what you were
instructed to do at those--

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.151 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They burned documents
and burned them fast.

00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Right That's right.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And the same should be
expected with anything

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
still very top secret
within our own government,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that we should not expect there
to be a trail of documents

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
pointing into the direction
that we need to go

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
to find answers regarding this.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they got
to the documents?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They ripped them
up, didn't they?

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, as the
General County of Office

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
determined for the late
congressman Steven Schiff

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
in 1997, that the documents had
supposedly all been destroyed.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe that.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I disbelieve that they have
been also encryptically encoded

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't recognize
them to see them,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and that wherever they
didn't need paper,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:90%
they didn't use paper.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It was all word of mouth.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It was dealing with the
military, with orders,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:90%
with instructions.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And they just went
through the motions.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:90%
They knew what to do.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
reaction at the time

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:90%
worldwide to this story?

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was there any
reaction from some

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
of the other countries, the
Soviet Union at the time?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.416 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Absolutely.

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the late
president, Joseph Stalin,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
according to Pravda, they
came out with a report in 1988

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
that Stalin, especially after
they were caught completely

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
flat-footed with the
first atomic bomb,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
they had no idea that we were
even working on the technology.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet after Roswell, he
did not believe the balloon

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
explanation.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:90%
He felt it still--

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Right.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, we do.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Because we accepted that.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We fell for it.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.344 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: We fell for it.

00:18:46.344 --> 00:18:48.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We accepted
everything governments

00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
said to us in that time.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And that's
the amazing thing,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that we accept what
the government tells us

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:90%
about everything.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:90%
But we don't.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:90%
We know we don't.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.495 align:middle line:84%
We've grown to
become very cynical--

00:18:59.495 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now we have.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.336 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --about most
things about the government,

00:19:02.336 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
except when it comes
to UFOs, except when

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.320 align:middle line:90%
it comes to Roswell.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can't
have it both ways.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just like with
deathbed testimony.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We can't say that
deathbeds are admissible

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and we accept them as factual
evidentiary information

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.380 align:middle line:90%
about everything except Roswell.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:90%
We can't have it both ways.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:90%
It's either the same for all.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
major conviction

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that I have regarding
this, that the witnesses,

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
down to their dying breaths,
are saying this did happen.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did anybody
report seeing the object

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
break up as it was coming down?

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
the Brazel testimony

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and him bringing
in the artifacts.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But did anybody
see something happening?

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: There were a
number of reports of people,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it was people at
the base, or even nuns

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:84%
as far as at St. Mary's
Hospital, and a number

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of local civilians given it's
just before a 4th of July

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
weekend.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
summer evening.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.464 align:middle line:90%
The thunderstorms are coming in.

00:20:13.464 --> 00:20:14.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
see it rolling in.

00:20:14.921 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: From the high
desert off the mountains.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
witnesses described

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:84%
either an unknown object
heading in that direction

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
or a light arching
with a contrail arching

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
within that region at that time.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But nothing definitive,
nothing that anybody

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
ever saw the actual crash,
the actual, as far as event,

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:90%
but certainly the aftermath.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When that
day comes and I'm

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
on my deathbed and my
family is around me,

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and if I had any trade
secrets of whatever I

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
may have done in my life,
that's the point where

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:90%
you begin to tell everything.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't lie on your deathbed.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I've never known
anybody who would.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Are there recent
deathbed confessions

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
from people who have
been witnesses to Roswell

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
or are in the know that they,
on their deathbed, have said

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:90%
something?

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Just imagine
this scenario where

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
you are about to go under
the knife for a major heart

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
surgery, quadruple bypass, and
you're lying there on a gurney

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and you're with your daughter.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.557 align:middle line:84%
And you wave her down, and
you realize that I may not

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:90%
walk away from this.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may not
come out of this.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: I might
not even wake up.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell
you this, sweetheart.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I was there in '47.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You know I was
stationed at Roswell.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was part of
the recovery operation.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I was out at the crash site.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:90%
I saw the craft.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I saw the bodies.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:90%
They were not from here.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:90%
One of them was alive.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
What would possess anyone
to doing such a thing?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly what
Sergeant Homer Rowlett

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:10%
did to his daughter.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.905 align:middle line:10%
When did that happen?

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHMIDT: That happened just
a few years ago before he died.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:90%
So again, it's contemporary.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:90%
It isn't back then.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
It isn't back in the '80s.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We're talking within
the last few years.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And both her and her
son are still alive.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:10%
And then she would
learn thereafter

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:10%
that her brother heard
the exact same thing

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.660 align:middle line:10%
before he went into the hospital
because he confided to him as

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:10%
well.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And the account was exact.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't that story
get widespread publicity?

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: No different
than why didn't

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesse Marcel, Major Marcel's
story about I handled

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
pieces that were
not from this Earth

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.730 align:middle line:84%
receive any publicity except
for the National Enquirer.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which nobody
believed at the time.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And then when
General Thomas DuBose, who

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:84%
was General Ramey's chief
of staff at Fort Worth, he's

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
in two of the photographs of
the substituted weather balloon.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And when he signed
an affidavit, which

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
stated, we substituted
the weather

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:18.532 align:middle line:84%
balloon for the actual material,
the balloon was a hoax,

00:23:18.532 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
you didn't read about
that in the press either.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:90%
We tried.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then what about
the dummies they talked about?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.114 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Precisely.

00:23:24.114 --> 00:23:26.619 align:middle line:84%
And that did make front
page New York Times.

00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
because it was silly.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Because
it was, again,

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
part of the smokescreen, part
of what their marching orders

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:90%
happened to be.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:10%
This is what you will again
disclose to the public.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if
it's not the truth.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what we want
them to believe.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's the sad part.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where-- that's

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful thing about your
work, George, and the people

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that you provide a forum
for expressing themselves.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't get that in other
venues, other arenas.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:90%
You're one of the lone voices.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're out there
all by ourselves these days.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: All by ourselves.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're as so many of the
pioneers throughout history.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
We take a lot of the
slings and arrows.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
But if not us, then who?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud to at least
claim that I've taken my share.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
the movie "Roswell,"

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
which was depicted from
your book "The UFO Crash

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:84%
at Roswell," there was
an interrogation scene

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that I want you to
talk about in a moment.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They said the material
was a weather balloon.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how in the hell
does a weather balloon affect

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:90%
our national security?

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm too stupid
or I think I am.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.634 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
get this, I mean,

00:24:38.634 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
unless you all are expecting
some sort of surprise balloon

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Look, there's just two
possibilities here.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Either that damn thing is a
flying saucer or it ain't.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, then
I'm owed $3,000.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.422 align:middle line:84%
And if it ain't, then
it's real simple.

00:24:58.422 --> 00:25:01.809 align:middle line:90%
I ain't owed nothing.

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that Hollywood,
or did that really happen?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.433 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: That really happened.

00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
That was actor, singer
Dwight Yoakam who portrayed

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
the rancher Mac Brazel.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
The weather balloon
explanation stuck.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Press accepted it and things
returned back to normal.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: In the meantime,
they've abducted Brazel

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.169 align:middle line:90%
and they're holding him out.

00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:27.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love the scene
of the guy with the fedora

00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
just kind of
looking down at him.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have many
descriptions of all the suits

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that all of the sudden arrived
in Roswell, the spooks,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, who
were spying around.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a weather
balloon story, right?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: For a
weather balloon story.

00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Secret Service agents-- we can
name the two representatives

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
of the president
at that time who

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
were overseeing the
operation with the Treasury

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Department, that type of thing.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:90%
But getting back to Brazel.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.710 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
they, the military,

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
who has no authority over us
as civilians, would abduct him.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, to keep him
locked up for five days,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
not allow him due process
to even call his own wife,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:90%
to call his boss--

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
charged with anything?

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Nothing.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.125 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, the military
can't charge you with anything.

00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
kidnapped him.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: They
just kidnapped him.

00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And they would interrogate him.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would question
him night after night,

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.132 align:middle line:84%
hour after hour, until
they finally broke him.

00:26:25.132 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they want
him to change his story?

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: And they got him to.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.551 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They got him to.

00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: They got him to.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And they took him to
the local newspaper

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and into the radio
station, KGFL,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.119 align:middle line:84%
where there were all
these MPs standing

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:90%
outside the door escorting him.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
changed his story.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
They basically
forced him to do it.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.622 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: They forced him to.

00:26:48.622 --> 00:26:51.612 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think it's time
we set the record straight.

00:26:51.612 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I reckon I knew all along that
this stuff out there weren't

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:90%
from outer space.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
After all them stories
come out about it--

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Then he just out
and out recants,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
says his conscience has
been bothering him a lot.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So he figured he
better tell everyone

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
what really went on
out there and maybe he

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't feel so bad.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You found this a
half month earlier?

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thereabouts.

00:27:13.721 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just lay
out there for a while.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.732 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think nothing of it.

00:27:16.732 --> 00:27:21.322 align:middle line:84%
Then I started hearing all them
stories about flying discs.

00:27:21.322 --> 00:27:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And some neighbors stopped
by my place one afternoon.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.276 align:middle line:84%
They said something
about somebody

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.887 align:middle line:84%
offering a reward, pieces
of disc or whatever.

00:27:27.887 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, what the
hell, I'll give it a shot.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> But the debris?

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, I mean, that was
just tinfoil and scotch tape,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:90%
balsa wood, I guess.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I never thought it'd cause
this kind of hullabaloo.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Mac.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That destroyed
the entire case, didn't it?

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: But it wasn't
the end of the story.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:10%
The actor, Bob Gutin, who was
portraying the radio announcer,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:10%
was the late Frank Joyce.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And Joyce, who had
an illustrious radio

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:10%
and television career
throughout New Mexico,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:10%
finally went public himself.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And he would disclose
exactly what Brazel told him

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the first time when he spoke
to him when he first came in

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:90%
from the sheriff's office.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.092 align:middle line:90%
And then once they went off--

00:28:20.092 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He saw a different
Mac Brazel, did he?

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --microphone and
they were out in the lobby,

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and Joyce noticed two MPs
standing outside the doorway--

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared him.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --who had
obviously escorted him

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:90%
to the radio station.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce asks him, what
about the little green men.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel, before he walks
out, and looks back at Joyce

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and said, but they
weren't green.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It's his way of telling him--

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: His way [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
a wink of the eye, right?

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: That we both
know what really happened.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must have
scared Brazel to death.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: In fact, when
he returned home, again,

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.316 align:middle line:84%
he talked about how it
had changed the people.

00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Hired
hands said that where

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Joyce was a man of his
word, a salt of the earth,

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:90%
he became a total recluse.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:84%
If this ever came up,
he would walk away.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We would track down
and talk to people

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.756 align:middle line:84%
that just ran into him at a
local pub, a local restaurant.

00:29:22.756 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they
would approach him,

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
he'd leave a full plate
of food and walk out,

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to
discuss the matter.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't out
of embarrassment.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just that he
was threatened.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:84%
He was warned, don't you
ever talk about this again.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And he was a man of his word.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So here we
are 70 years later.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to get
anything new out of this?

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: One of the things
we're focusing on right now,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
especially with the attrition
rate of the World War II

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
generation, we've just
about run out of witnesses.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And even the sons and daughters
are now starting to pass away.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about
Major Jesse Marcel.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, his own son,
Dr./Colonel Jesse Marcel Jr.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
just passed away
a few years ago.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure did.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: So we're losing the--

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A good man too.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Doctor in Iraq.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Doctor.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I refer to him as an
officer and a gentleman.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And we now have to continue our
due diligence with the history.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we're
focusing on, for example,

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
is the process of
testing the wreckage.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Where would it have gone?

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.154 align:middle line:84%
And we have found the
makings of some paper trail--

00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to be somewhere.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --at
Battell Institute,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:84%
as we know for a fact
it can be documented,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
even the press accounts.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:10%
The wreckage from Roswell
went to Wright Field,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Wright Patterson Air
Force Base, at the time

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:10%
for testing and analysis.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, where did
it go from there?

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting
to piece together

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
not only Battell Institute,
but Hughes Aircraft,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:84%
the Bureau of Standards, Rand
Corporation, General Electric.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we find out, were
discover what type of research

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
they were conducting at that
time and see if it links,

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.276 align:middle line:90%
see if it ties in.

00:31:11.276 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, If we could
only find it and get it.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And we're planning
on another archaeological dig

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:90%
for this fall.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So we continue all of our
efforts minus the witnesses.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
who are dying away.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Who are
quickly passing away.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a pig
rancher out there in the area?

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And first hand, in a
sense, he overheard.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.110 align:middle line:90%
His name was Raymond Pollard.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.911 align:middle line:90%
They had a swine--

00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:34.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he dead?

00:31:34.743 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: He's still
alive, 92 years old.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 92.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: We talked
to him just last fall.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was his daily job, he
would drive onto the base.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:90%
He had a pass.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And they would pick up all
the refuse, all that waste,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:90%
the garbage from the mess halls.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: And he pulls up--

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he feed
them to the pigs, right?

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.001 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Feed the pigs.

00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So it served both
purposes very well.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And he overheard a sergeant
on the loading dock

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%
talking about the strange
people north of town

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.605 align:middle line:90%
at this crash site.

00:32:06.605 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Strange people,
being the occupants?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: The occupants.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:16.295 align:middle line:10%
And we now question, because we
had a MP by a name of Melvin E.

00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Brown who was posted
behind an ambulance truck,

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:10%
told to keep his eyes forward.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And the first chance he
got, he lifted up a tarp,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and there were a
couple of the bodies.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was a
member of K Squad,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:90%
which was the Kitchen Squadron.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:90%
So was that Melvin Brown?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Did he happen to
overhear Brown telling

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
somebody else about the strange
people at that crash site?

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's just so
many conflicting stories.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's just amazing.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:90%
What keeps driving you, Don?

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: That there
isn't as much contradiction

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
as one would think,
that it's almost

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
as though whether
military, civilian, press,

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
they're all reading
from the same script.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:90%
There's the Rashomon effect.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a Japanese murder
case that became a movie.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And the whole trial is
centered on the fact

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that there are three
positions on every event.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
There's your opinion,
there's my opinion,

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and there is what
actually happened.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.548 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: I think the
difference is as opposed

00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to the skeptics,
the scoffers who

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
say my opinion is what actually
happened, take it or leave it.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
In our case, the investigation
is still ongoing.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's still fluid.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We're still trying to determine
what actually happened.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
we will continue

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
until we finally either
get full disclosure

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
or we're able to prove
with an actual piece

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of physical evidence
what actually did happen.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
story that would be.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Greatest
story of the Millennium.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so too.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And how could one
walk away from that?

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You can only remain
passionate for the possibility

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that if we're wrong, it
doesn't change anything.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we're right,
it changes everything.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Several
years ago there's

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:90%
a former CIA member who died.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And right before
he died, he said this.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But my boss filled me in on
Project Blue Book and what they

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:84%
had found so far as far
as graves and aliens,

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and the Roswell incident.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.396 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you feel when
this first got dumped on you?

00:34:44.396 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
When you first
learned about this?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:51.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was just kind of
overwhelmed with all of this.

00:34:51.042 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
I don't know if I'm

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to be a judge
of this type of thing, what's

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:84%
real and what's
not, when I don't

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:90%
have much knowledge of it.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> What did he say?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, well, we'll have to
build the information as we go.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how this
thing is working out.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the other
thing is, of course,

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you really weren't able to
tell family or close friends,

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell anybody.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had to take a vow
that I wouldn't tell anybody

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it for 40 years,
and more of it for 50 years.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was a former
CIA man being interviewed

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
by our very own Richard Dolan--

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Richard
Dolan, correct.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --about this case.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, why would a guy
who is close to death lie?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: It's reminiscent of
when we were on a CBS 48 Hours.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
senior newsman, Phil Jones,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:00.585 align:middle line:90%
who worked directly--

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:01.501 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good newsman.

00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: --under Dan Rather.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was the one time that
they ended the segment, Dan

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Rather stating that truly
something extraordinary crashed

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
outside of Roswell,
New Mexico in 1947.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So what a wonderful
advocation, the fact

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that here is CBS saying
something extraordinary

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
crashed.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But Jones, we were walking
outside the very hangar,

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.122 align:middle line:84%
P3, it's called
Building 84, where

00:36:25.122 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
much of the wreckage
and the bodies

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.496 align:middle line:84%
transited through at the
time of the incident.

00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Originally.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And he
says to his boys,

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.020 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that a
number of the officers

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:84%
just sat down over a few
drinks back then at the PX

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.744 align:middle line:84%
and they just concocted
this whole thing thinking

00:36:40.744 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that at some point they
were all going to make

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:90%
a lot of money off of it.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, and
they all waited till they

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:90%
were either dying or gone--

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To make that money.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --before
they finally realized,

00:36:50.116 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I better start today, because
I may not have tomorrow.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
How silly does
that-- and he goes,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that does sound
pretty ridiculous.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
was no money in this?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: No.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: No.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just the stories.

00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
The military PR
guy, Walter Haut--

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Walter Haut, yes.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did he
say later on in life?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, as we discussed
how there were little tidbits,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:84%
there were little
smatterings of the truth

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that he came out
with here and there,

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and then realizing
that as often as we

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
tried to get him to acknowledge
his full involvement.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was that close to
the base commander Colonel

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Blanchard.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when Colonel
Blanchard, who

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.190 align:middle line:84%
far from being reprimanded
over such a blunder

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:84%
misidentifying a weather
balloon for a flying saucer,

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:84%
he went on to become
a four star general.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.287 align:middle line:84%
And when Blanchard died at
his desk at the Pentagon--

00:37:40.287 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Died at his desk?

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: At his
desk at the Pentagon.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just send
a wire or a letter

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
informing Walter in
Roswell about his passing.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:90%
They sent a special courier.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: That's how
close they still were.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the point was that
we just could never

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:84%
accept that Walter only had
a cursory knowledge of what

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:90%
transpired.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We knew we had to know as
much or more than most.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So Walter would
finally acknowledge

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that he was allowed to
go out to the hangar,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
he saw the remains of this ship,
he saw a number of the bodies

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:90%
under a tarp on the floor.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.050 align:middle line:90%
He handled the wreckage.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.710 align:middle line:84%
He brought back from the crash
site, the impact site, some

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:84%
of the remnants and was
able to display them

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:90%
to his own office staff.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:84%
He was at the
staff meeting where

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.780 align:middle line:84%
they contrived putting out
the original press release

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and then retracting it five
hours later with the hope

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.579 align:middle line:84%
that in reeling it back in,
the press and the public

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:45.120 align:middle line:84%
would accept the
balloon explanation.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they did.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.959 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: And they did.

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So they calculated correctly,
and they were right.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the
movie "Roswell,"

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
which was a great depiction
of your book "UFO Crash

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
at Roswell," let's
take a look at how

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.392 align:middle line:90%
they summarized all of this.

00:39:00.392 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because maybe you wouldn't
even know what was true

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.390 align:middle line:84%
if you'd seen it
all for yourself.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.450 align:middle line:90%
How's that for an answer?

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, then what did I
see out there in that field?

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that?

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Why, that was a weather balloon.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it wasn't.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I know what I saw, and it
was not from this world.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't you understand, Jesse?

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Just a lot of old memories
and secondhand recollections.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to take you
seriously, not without proof,

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:90%
not without hard evidence.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is that
hard evidence, Don?

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Wonderful scene
with actor Martin Sheen.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he's a great actor.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: He's kind of
playing a deep throat.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So a bit of a composite
and everything.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And the point, and it's the
same frustration that not only

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that we continue to possess,
but all the witnesses.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.800 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you
experience, you have no proof.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.390 align:middle line:90%
You have no evidence.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And what's wonderful
about Roswell.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Like all other UFO
incidents, which

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
are just fleeting,
just something that

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
just quickly transpires
and there's nothing

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.070 align:middle line:84%
that you can hold onto, that
you can take into a lab,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Roswell was the
recovery of something.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And from all accounts,
something extraordinary.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to point
our finger skyward.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We can point our
fingers to Washington.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.320 align:middle line:84%
We can point our fingers
to specific facilities

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.860 align:middle line:84%
where we still suspect may
be conducting such research.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Or as Steven Spielberg
has demonstrated,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
when you can't figure something
out, like in his movies

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:84%
"Raiders of the Lost Ark,"
Indiana Jones, if you can't

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.740 align:middle line:84%
find the On button,
all you can do

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is crate it up and hide
it, never to be seen again.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I remain very skeptical
that after all these years

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:84%
it's still a cover-up
of ignorance,

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that it's such a quantum leap
between the technologies,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:90%
we can't bridge that as of yet.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And all we can do is go
back to it every so often

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and resume some of the testing.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.474 align:middle line:84%
So I personally am very
skeptical about disclosure.

00:41:10.474 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I do too.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.732 align:middle line:90%
I tell Steve Bassett that--

00:41:12.732 --> 00:41:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: They have
nothing to disclose.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not
going to tell us.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: They have,
I think, Tracy Tormé,

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:84%
the Peabody Award
winning screenwriter,

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:90%
uses the best analogy.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You could take something
as simple as a toaster

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:90%
and teleport it back in time--

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People wouldn't
know what it was.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: But they may
be able to take it apart,

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:90%
put it back together again.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But if they can't plug it in,
they can never get it to work.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, we
still can't plug this in.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:90%
So what do they disclose?

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So all we can do
is continue to try

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to put together the puzzle,
whatever information we have.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have to at
least acknowledge

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have forced the hand
of the government in the sense

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that we are now up to four
official explanations.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I always joke about a husband
trying that with his wife

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.797 align:middle line:84%
some night if he
come home too late.

00:41:57.797 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, try this story, honey.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:90%
They won't work.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: But so
far, it's what we're

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:84%
dealing with with Roswell,
four explanations.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has
always baffled me,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Don, is the technology that
would cause the craft to crash.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They got
here from God knows

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:84%
where, how many millions
of light years away

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.800 align:middle line:84%
through incredible technology
of bending space and time,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:90%
But why would it crash?

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, as
I described early on,

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.780 align:middle line:84%
there was a tremendous
lightning storm.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The original conclusion is that
we were already dealing with

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.150 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
propulsion, anti-gravity,

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:84%
something that essentially
worked off as far as--

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that threw it
off kilter or something.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.601 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And just
imagine the combination

00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:46.500 align:middle line:90%
of that and lightning.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we were dealing
with somewhat of a scout

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
craft launched from a
mother ship or something--

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to speculate.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't like speculation.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we were dealing more
with an atmospheric craft,

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to an
actual spacecraft--

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.105 align:middle line:90%
It came aboard something.

00:43:03.105 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: One of
the flight engineers,

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
he was a flight mechanic
who worked with the 393rd,

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.900 align:middle line:84%
his name was Sergeant
William Ennis.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So they worked on the
Silverplates, the B-29 bombers.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.140 align:middle line:84%
They could take them down, a
part down to the last rivet,

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:90%
put them back together again.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And before he died he said
to me, Don, before I go,

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:84%
you have to find out
how that thing flew.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.330 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a
moving part on it.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:90%
So again, what do you replicate?

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
a chance to talk

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to those secret
keepers of information,

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.094 align:middle line:84%
what would you ask
them to reveal?

00:43:36.094 --> 00:43:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, two things.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask them, what would have
possessed them to essentially

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:48.420 align:middle line:84%
apply such fear and intimidation
to civilians where they have

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.220 align:middle line:84%
no authority, when they knew
that the balloon was going

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to be accepted, that
things were going

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to return to normal post-haste.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And after all these years, why
is such fear and intimidation

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:90%
still being orchestrated?

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:84%
We still have witnesses
that get phone calls.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haut, his late
wife would tell us

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years they were
getting late night phone

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:84%
calls still threatening them,
still warning them about this.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on here?

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that is
even out of your control,

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond your technology?

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself would be
just a tremendous revelation.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly, if we are
dealing with an intelligence

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:84%
off the planet, has
there been any contact?

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you in some way
cooperating with them?

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, are we
dealing with either something

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.190 align:middle line:84%
benevolent, or are we
dealing with something

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that the great
secret in all this

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is that we're dealing
with something

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.977 align:middle line:90%
that is still rather suspect?

00:44:58.977 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they can't stop it.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And
they can't stop it.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
get one question answered

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
about Roswell, what
would that question be?

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, of course,
was it from off the planet.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that's still the biggest
mystery, the biggest obstacle.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we dealing with
something so advanced

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
that it still was of an earthly
origin, which I don't believe.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I just can't see
now after 70 years

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that it hasn't been released,
that it hasn't been disclosed.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all other
such technology

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that has been
advanced since then,

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I would like to believe we've
seen for better or worse.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And what was so important?

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:84%
What's the deep, dark
secret about Roswell?

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:48.174 align:middle line:84%
It's something more sinister
that forced them to--

00:45:48.174 --> 00:45:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not disclose.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: --apply such
suppression not only

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the witnesses, but
also their families.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.650 align:middle line:84%
What were they so
afraid of back then?

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And what are they
still so afraid of?

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there something beyond
even that realization

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:90%
that we're not alone?

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:10%
To me, there's still
something else.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.390 align:middle line:10%
And that may be the most
disconcerting aspect

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.330 align:middle line:10%
of all this, that
there is something much

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.661 align:middle line:10%
more Machiavellian in nature.

00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: George,
always a pleasure.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Good luck with the
show, as always.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably one of the
most incredible stories ever,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:26.970 align:middle line:90%
the crash at Roswell.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.060 align:middle line:10%
But with investigators like
Don Schmidt, maybe one day

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.440 align:middle line:10%
we will really get that answer.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank
you for watching Beyond Belief.
