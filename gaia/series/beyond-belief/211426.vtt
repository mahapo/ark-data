>>GEORGE NOORY: Well
welcome to this edition

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Oren Harris, also known as
O, is a spiritual teacher

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:10%
and a coach who is devoted
to elevating consciousness,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:10%
awakening people
to their divinity,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:10%
and empowering them to live
their highest potential.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.418 align:middle line:84%
What a great service
you provide us.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OREN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.283 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:38.083 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Well, I was
never raised or groomed

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:10%
to be a spiritual teacher or
a coach or any of the things

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:10%
that I'm doing right now.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:10%
Just through life experience,
through revelation,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:10%
through discovery of
myself through exploration,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:10%
I found myself in the field
of transformation, so kind

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:10%
of by accident but on purpose.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:10%
Honestly, in the beginning,
really challenging life

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:10%
experiences led to
what I would now

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:10%
call spiritual awakenings and
the pursuit of deeper knowledge

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:10%
of myself, which then had
me re-evaluate my life

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:10%
and what it is that I'm doing.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a teacher
and coach sports.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I took a leap
of faith and decided

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.488 align:middle line:84%
to really discover
why I am here and what

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm meant to do on this planet.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
was a big step for you.

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:30.952 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, a massive
step, a leap into the unknown.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
your friends say?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They said,
what are you doing?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Especially because my job at the
time, I was doing really well.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I was coaching sports.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.603 align:middle line:90%
We won a couple championships.

00:01:39.603 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching school.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything was actually
going very well.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And, initially,
what sparked me was

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I fast-forwarded to
the end of my life.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined sitting in my
last days reflecting on my life

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and regretting the
chances I didn't take,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the dreams I didn't go after,
and just wondering what if.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And that propelled me
to take a leap of faith

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and to at least try to do
some of the things that

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
were on my mind at the
time, initially acting,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:90%
being an entrepreneur.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
So yes, my friends were
like, what are you doing?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.689 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Like you've got-- things are
going really well for you.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
made that move,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
was it scary for you
in the beginning?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It was really scary.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I was both inspired and
terrified at the same time.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of my first
initiations into deep faith

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and starting to trust my
heart, trust my spirit,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and trust the flow of life.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was
definitely scary.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
learned, as you evolved

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness, four stages,
four modes of consciousness.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Victim mode, hustle
mode, flow mode, God mode,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about those.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Victim mode.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
victim mode is feeling

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
like we are at the
effect of life,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
at the effect of circumstances,
situations, people.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It's when we feel like life
is to blame for how we feel,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
for what's happening,
for what's not happening.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
disempowered state

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that we've all experienced
and probably still experience

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to some degree, where
deep down, what's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
happening when we're
in victim mode is that,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
consciously or
unconsciously, we feel

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
like we're separate
from life, or we believe

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:90%
that we're separate from life.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Life is out-- not working
for us, but against us.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So we have to kind of
stay on the defense.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%
How about hustle mode?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Hustle
mode is where we

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
start to come into
our sovereignty

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and develop a healthy sense of
ego, a healthy sense of esteem.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We realize that we are--
instead of being codependent,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:90%
we are independent.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would liken hustle mode
to discovering motivation.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
This is like discovering
the power of the mind,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
the power of our will, the
energy of determination

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and stick-to-it-iveness and
all these different things.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And so hustle mode is
expanding now deeper

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
into the power that
lies within us.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's still a sufficient
amount of I or a person

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
involved, meaning like
it's I. Independently,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
I am the one that is
at cause of my life.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when we move into what
I call flow mode or life is

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
happening now through us instead
of life is happening by me,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
this is when we start to
awaken to that divine spark

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
of infinite
intelligence, intuition.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we're in the flow,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
in the right place
at the right time.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the groove.

00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In the
groove, in the zone.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Artists call it
divine inspiration.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Athletes call it the zone.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
This is where we really
start to experience

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that there is a power
existing inside of us,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
around us that we have access to
that is greater than ourselves.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it significantly
increases our--

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
well, pretty much
everything-- our health,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
our capacity to create,
our capacity to give.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.368 align:middle line:84%
And life starts
happening through us.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:90%
So I call that flow mode.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll bet you
were a motivational coach,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.588 align:middle line:90%
weren't you?

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: A motivational coach?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
really got people

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:90%
going when you did sports.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, definitely
a motivational coach.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I would say that even more
than motivation, inspiration.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.087 align:middle line:90%
Motivation is something that--

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
the way I experience
motivation is something

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.725 align:middle line:84%
that we generate
through our will.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a force of
energy that we're

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
able to call upon,
whereas inspiration

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
awakens from within.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
inspiration, we're not just

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:90%
moving energy with our will.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We're being moved by energy.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And inspiration is
something that we awaken to.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I have been and
am an inspirational coach

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and speaker.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.587 align:middle line:84%
And one of my inspirations is
to awaken inspiration in others

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and connect to their own--

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I bet you do.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:90%
How about the God mode?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: God mode is
unity consciousness.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And so whereas in flow mode,
life is happening through me.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
In God mode, life
is happening as me.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where the separate
self or sense of self, the I,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
what we refer to as my identity,
when I say the word "I."

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
This is when we've expanded
beyond our separate sense

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of self, and we've
merged more with life.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And so life is happening as me.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would say that
Jesus Christ, Yeshua saying, I

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and the Father are one.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to
perform miracles.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
That's because he was operating
in this state of unity

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you say that
it is happening through you,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.253 align:middle line:84%
explain that for
me a little more.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it's
like the difference

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
between if I was an artist, for
example, which I am an artist.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to sit down and
say, I want to write a story.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:90%
I want to write a poem.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:90%
I want to create a piece of art.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And I use my
resources to do that.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.545 align:middle line:90%
And I might be thinking.

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I might be thinking
what would be good.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:90%
What wouldn't be good.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this mode of
thinking from the I.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:90%
It's the difference between--

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that would be like
life is happening

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:90%
by me or like hustle mode.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas sometimes when we sit
down to do a piece of art,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:90%
we're in a state of receptivity.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's less about
we're thinking

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
about how to do something.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're receiving
divine inspiration.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:90%
We're receiving downloads.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we become the conduit
to translate that into form,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:90%
into expression.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And when art
happens in that way,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we experience it as if
it's happening through us.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:90%
We're being moved by it.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
like the midwife

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
nurturing it into
existence versus trying

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
to think of something to do.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you did a
consciousness experiment

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.625 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how people
can tap into this God mode.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I did, yes.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's watch it.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.152 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I, Oren Harris, do
not know where all the cards are

00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
in this deck when
they're face down

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
unless I just look at them.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But I, my infinite
self, connected

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to source, infinite
intelligence,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
knows where all of the cards
are and pretty much knows

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to choose
a card here in a moment,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
choose a number, and move into
a space of pure receptivity

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and union with
source intelligence

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and allow the card
to be revealed.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm choosing
the nine, the nine.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
nine of hearts,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.874 align:middle line:84%
but let's just go
with nine for now.

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.438 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So, hopefully, you could
feel the state of allowing,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of receptivity, and
of presence that

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
allows that level of attunement
because I could not do that.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Or the odds would be
stacked against me

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
if I was trying to
do this experiment.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, come on now, O.
You really pulled that off?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.602 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, I have many--

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.477 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Just the
same way I'm speaking

00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
about tuning into a
state of receptivity

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
whereby you can channel
art or channel dance.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I just relax into a
space of no thought.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, right now, I can just--

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let it happen?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --not think.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, the subtle
information, which information

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is always traveling--
light frequency

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
is information-- then
I can just sense.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's not I who is
sensing where the card is.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the infinite
intelligence inside me.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And by relaxing, by tuning
into a space of no mind,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
then these subtle impulses,
which would be the knowing

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
of like, oh, the
card's right there,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the broader aspect of me--
call it spirit, intuition,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:90%
infinite intelligence--

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
it just registers as a
knowing in the moment.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've done that
several times with groups,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
with audiences, and when
there's cameras involved--

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you psychic?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.225 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we're all
psychic, because we are all--

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
better than others.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Some
better than others.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on how attuned we

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
are, how well we can
translate information

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%
that is always present.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you have been
doing remote viewing there too?

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, remote viewing
would be an absolutely another

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
way to describe it,
being able to see

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
with senses beyond our physical
eyes, which would make sense,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, how are we able to see
in our dreams without our eyes?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
How are we able to
see in our mind's eye?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
If I said, imagine a cat right
now, most people could do that.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
How are we seeing
it without our eyes?

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's really showing
us that we are

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.640 align:middle line:84%
able to see beyond just
using the physical instrument

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
of our eyes.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
We all have that ability.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would guess that
ability you just demonstrated,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
you have done this time and
time again, haven't you?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, far, far
beyond it being luck.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a magic trick.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced that many,
many, many times in my life

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and frequently in my
life, just knowing.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing that exists beyond
mental knowing or knowledge.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
sometimes come close

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
where maybe it's not
the nine of hearts,

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
but you pulled the
eight of hearts?

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Sometimes
come close where

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:90%
it's like the very next card.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be sensing, and I'll
pull a card, and it's not.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But then I look, and
it's the very next card.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.688 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like maybe
a split second off.

00:11:53.688 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's
happened a few times.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
did it take for you

00:11:56.772 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to get into
this meditation posture?

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's taken
many, many years.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a result of a lot
of work, work in loving myself,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
work in opening up
my consciousness,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
work in surrendering, work
in trust, work in faith,

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and just being able
to, I guess kind of,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
decode these feelings
or frequencies,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and be able to translate them.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like channeling,
somebody who's channeling.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.208 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're channeling
a masterpiece of art,

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
you're channeling another
point of consciousness.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:90%
You're channeling an alien.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:90%
You're channeling somebody.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:90%
You're dancing.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, that state of
receptivity and channeling

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
natural to all of us.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that I have
awakened, cultivated, nurtured,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:90%
practiced constantly.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Even coming into this
show is a good example.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking for
years without preparation,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.035 align:middle line:84%
without thinking about
what I'm going to say.

00:12:57.035 --> 00:12:57.835 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:12:57.835 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
happens, doesn't it?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it just happens.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like building a muscle.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of those four states of
flow that we just talked about,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
which one would you categorize
for what you just showed us?

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I would say
that's stage four,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
life is happening as me or
unity consciousness, God mode.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like merging with the
field of infinite intelligence

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:90%
that knows where the card is.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something that I,
Oren, could do, or I could try.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I was
trying to do it,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
if I was using my brain
power or trying to calculate

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:84%
or trying to use a technique,
all of these things

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
could work to some degree.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But I would put that
in another category.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like the difference
between being a magician

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and being magic.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.325 align:middle line:84%
When we're being
magic itself, that's

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:90%
when we merge with the creator.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Then it just happens.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you use that
in your day-to-day life?

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I use my intuition
and my knowing in my business,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
in my relationship,
in my decision making,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in my creation,
in my leadership,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:90%
pretty much in everything.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
We all have our skills,
our knowledge, our talents,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
our wisdom, our
resources available to us

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to live our lives, to create,
to do whatever we want to do.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we always
have 24/7 access to intuition,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to infinite intelligence.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I essentially have made
that my baseline operating

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
system in a way of
navigating through life.

So I use it in every
aspect of my life.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Tell us again
about the flow state

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and how that relates to that.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, the flow state
is like a peak performance

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness,
which, really,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
what we come to
discover, it's actually

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
our natural unconditioned state.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:90%
But a flow state is--

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
when we're in a flow
state, we have essentially

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
expanded our consciousness
beyond our limited perception

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of self, like the I,
like when I say I, Oren.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And because we expand
our consciousness

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond the construct
of our self,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
all of these other
resources, this intelligence

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%
becomes available to us.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we're the best
version of ourselves.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We're in the right
place at the right time.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicities happen.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicities--

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People are connected.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%

right place, right time.

This is actually
the natural state

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of living when we feel
safe in our hearts,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
when we feel relaxed,
when we're not

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
situated so much in our mind.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:84%
This is when we can tap into
that divine flow and, really,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.133 align:middle line:90%
the pulse of nature.

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've called it
the wireless internet,

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:90%
this connection.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Totally, yeah.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wireless internet, GPS.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I have crazy stories of being
able to navigate to a location

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
without a map just
following that.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just by thinking.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, actually,
by less thinking and tuning

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
into that intelligence that's
always registering in our body.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: O, give us an
example of something

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that just boggled your mind
that you've been able to do.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the nine
of hearts is one of them.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, the
demonstration with the cards.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I've participated
in many healings

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
with individuals who were in
urgent physical circumstances.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And mental.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, and
mental circumstances.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many
experiences where I--

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of manifestation of just
thinking of something,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and then it happens, things
I've been able to do,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.335 align:middle line:84%
move things just with the power
of my mind or my consciousness.

00:16:55.335 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced many
things that would

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:90%
be considered to be miraculous.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a gift?

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's a
gift, but it's not

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
a gift that's unique to
me, like, as a personality.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a gift that's
unique to all of us.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
We are all connected to God
source, infinite intelligence.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we get ourselves out of
the way, however that happens,

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
wisdom or through grace

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
or through meditation, any
time we get ourselves out

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.593 align:middle line:90%
of the way, we expand.

00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we expand our
hearts and our consciousness,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
then these things that might
seem impossible or miraculous

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:90%
are just natural.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you master

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
if you know how

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, for sure.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, I've
talked about it.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.815 align:middle line:84%
And I've also
experienced it firsthand.

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
called telekinesis,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and let's take a look.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.961 align:middle line:90%
[COLDPLAY, "MAGIC"]

00:17:55.961 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.772 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) Call it magic.

00:18:07.772 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Call it true.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.135 align:middle line:84%
I call it magic
when I'm with you.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:33.356 align:middle line:84%
And I just got broken,
broken into two.

00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:36.855 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.855 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't know if I've
ever shared that publicly.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad I--

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the material that
allows it to move like that?

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it's
not the material,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because as you can
see in the video,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.237 align:middle line:84%
if it's just sitting
there, it's not moving.

00:18:51.237 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was aluminum, right?

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.653 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And if you
understand the physics of it,

00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a piece of aluminum
foil folded in half

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and then set on top of a needle.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And so there's not a lot
of physical friction.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's able-- if you hit it,
it's able to move quite easily

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and spin around.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
weren't blowing on it?

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see--

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, no
blowing, no wind.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I was inside my apartment.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
No, I was just kind
of like the cards.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It feels some
vibration coming off you?

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm sure if
you were measuring--

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
had an instrument to
measure vibration,

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
there's probably some vibration
emanating through my hands.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
combination of vibration

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
but, also, just the use of
our minds because our minds

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:90%
can move matter.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, mind and matter
are very closely connected.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you coach
within Infinite Potential?

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I work with
leaders, high performers,

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
people across different
industries as a coach

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
and as a mentor.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, as a
coach, I have, let's say,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:90%
three main objectives.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
One is to love them
unconditionally.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Two is to help them awaken to
exactly what I'm speaking to,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
which is to their soul, to
their own unique genius,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and to the divine
within, and also

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
to help them fulfill
their destiny,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:90%
to actualize their potential.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I
am able to do that

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is very much in the
same way that I'm

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
speaking about the cards or
about moving the tin foil.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is through getting
myself out of the way,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
connecting to that
space inside myself.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So then if I'm connected
to the God in me,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I can see that in them and
help nurture and awaken

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and help them to
fulfill their potential.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.952 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't
operate on a script.

00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Very much like when I'm
sitting here right now,

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I have some knowledge.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I have some skills.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I understand human potential.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going with the flow.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm tuning into
infinite intelligence, which

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
allows me to show
up as whatever,

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
whatever type of energy, whether
it's masculine or feminine,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
whatever piece of
information, whatever

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to be most
helpful to that soul

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in fulfilling their
vision, in awakening

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:90%
more of their potential.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
By being a vessel
and being open,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I can allow anything
to manifest through me.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not limited.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:90%
What I'm saying is by--

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not limited by my
own knowledge or skills

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:90%
as a coach or mentor.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I have access to--

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I connect to their soul.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I have access to infinite
intelligence to fulfill.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So I get myself out of the
way, is another way to say it.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody ever

And you've been able to use
that to help other people?

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, definitely.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:90%
It's myself and other people.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that
we can best help people

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is by being in our
own shine, being

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
connected to our own magic.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's another way
that I kind of indirectly

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
am able to help people,
is just by doing the best

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that I can to be
my authentic self,

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to allow the radiance of
my own being to shine,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:90%
and to shine that upon others.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my favorite
words, O, is manifestation.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Manifestation.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing the word
"manifestation" a few years ago

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in manifest station, very
much like a radio station.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
When you tune to different
stations, if you go to 96.5,

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's playing
classical music.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go to 101.8, it's
playing country music.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:10%
And so as consciousness,
we're able to tune

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:10%
into different stations.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:10%
These could be
different vibrations.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:10%
And if we shift our
vibration and tune

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:10%
into a different station,
then it manifests.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a manifest station.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And so we're always manifesting.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We're either doing that
consciously or unconsciously,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
deliberately or accidentally
through our words,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
through our focus, and, most
of all, through our being.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
manifest what we want?

00:23:09.572 --> 00:23:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean, we can
manifest what we want.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But, essentially,
at the core, we're

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:84%
manifesting who we
are, who we're being.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So we might say we
want a house or a car

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:90%
or a particular relationship.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But that represents
a state of being.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And so life is always
reflecting back to us

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:84%
through manifestation who
it is that we're being.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not
so much manifesting

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we want, but
who it is that we are being.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And so being is primary when
it comes to manifestation.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a higher
power that kind of pushes this

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.538 align:middle line:90%
along and makes it happen?

00:23:46.538 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things that we
experience when we're in flow.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And we had an intention,
a goal, a desire.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.348 align:middle line:84%
And beyond our
own orchestration,

00:23:57.348 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
we're in the right
place at the right time.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And we happen to coincidentally
run into that person

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:90%
or into that thing.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say that's
the higher power,

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
or you could say our
higher self taking us

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
along the trail of life and
lighting up certain things

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
in our pathway that are helping
us towards the manifestation.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you help people who

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
don't believe they can do this?

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Or do you?

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Usually, there is some spark.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.845 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're super
skeptical and doubting--

00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doubting Thomases.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, the
doubting Thomases.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
If they have enough openness
or enough inspiration or enough

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
desperation, then that
creates a kind of openness.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.155 align:middle line:84%
So as long as there's a spark,
even the smallest of sparks--

00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little bit.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --even if
it's just, I'm curious.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the
people that come to me

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:90%
are beyond curiosity.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And they do believe.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're ready to go.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're ready to go.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But I do have souls that
come across my path that

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
are very rigid and appear
to be very not ready.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But something inside of them
is actually ready to pop.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So that does happen
occasionally.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would say also
one of the reasons

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that I can help people, even
if they're not very well versed

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in spiritual language or
understanding of the universe,

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is that connecting to my heart
and speaking to the being,

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to speak in
different languages.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
different languages

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:84%
like Spanish or Japanese,
but just in a way

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to be able
to actually hear and, more

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
importantly, feel what
it is that I'm saying.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I've
also been able to speak

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
to people's hearts
and to people's souls

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
because love, the
language of our heart,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is able to transcend
language, right?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Because people can feel even if
they're not into these things.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:84%
People's souls and
hearts are intelligent.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who's
speaking from their heart

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
has the capacity to reach
beyond someone's mind.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah, it happens.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you met some
people who just get it?

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
They understand it?

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, kids, a lot of
young kids just get it.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And, definitely, the kids that
are coming in nowadays are--

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
they're tuned in.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:90%
They're tapped in.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:90%
They're plugged in.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
They just get it.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Even they get it
beyond the concepts

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the knowledge
and beyond the language.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us the difference
between strong consciousness

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and luck, for example.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Luck is interesting.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:90%
What is--

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is luck?

00:26:37.657 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: What is luck?

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a great question.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:90%
What is luck?

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I know that what I'm calling
synchronicity and meaningful

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
coincidences could
seem like luck

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:90%
from our limited perspective.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are the
odds that I would run

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:90%
into this person at this time?

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:90%
What are the chances?

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:90%
It seems like luck.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great question.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:90%
What's luck to you?

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a guest who
appears on our radio station

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:90%
quite often.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
His name is Joseph Gallenberger.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:90%
He's a professor.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:90%
He does experiments in luck.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And he sets it up
in Vegas because he

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
says you get immediate results,
and you know if it's working

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And what he does, O, is he
brings two groups of people--

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
happy, upbeat people and
people who are not happy.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And he makes sure
they're not happy.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he sends
them out into Vegas.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
He gives them some money and
says, go play the slot machine.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Go do this.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Go do that.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The happy people always
come back winners.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:90%
They're luckier.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The unhappy
people don't.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
He has concluded-- he's
done this 16 times.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
He has concluded that the
inner spirit of happiness

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
develops your luck and
who you're going to be.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I would
agree with that 100%.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I have overwhelming
evidence of being,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:90%
quote unquote, "lucky."

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.825 align:middle line:90%
But being in a state of--

00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm taking
you to Vegas.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You're having me
remember something.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Back when I started
playing with the cards--

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:90%
this was a few years ago.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I actually--this
was many years ago.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I put an ad on Craigslist.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a crazy story
to remember here.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I put an ad on Craigslist.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This is when law of
attraction was really big.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, law of
attraction experiment.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I basically
said that if there

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who loves to
play cards or is a gambler,

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.608 align:middle line:84%
like authentically
loves it, that I

00:28:39.608 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
would go do this
experiment with them

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and go with them to the
casino and check this out.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what I did, not
to prove to this guy

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that I could be
a source of luck,

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
but just as a demonstration
to inspire him.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I actually took--

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe to
prove something to you.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right, right.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I took out my camera, and
I took the deck of cards.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said on camera--

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:84%
this was to the guy
that I was going

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:90%
to meet to go to the casino.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, let's meet up.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.852 align:middle line:84%
I took out a camera
and a deck of cards.

00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I'm going
to meet you in the future.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.352 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
going to the casino to go

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:90%
gambling to do this experiment.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going to
ask you to pick a card.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was shuffling
through the deck.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And the card the nine of
hearts came up, and I said,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
this is the card that you're
going to pick in the future

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:90%
when I meet you.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, turn the camera off.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.723 align:middle line:84%
Several days later or
a couple days later,

00:29:31.723 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:90%
I went to go meet him.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about the experiment.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, but
how is it possible?

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And then I asked him.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, will you pick a card?

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.135 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a magic trick?

00:29:44.135 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, just what's the
first card that comes to you

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.970 align:middle line:90%
out of a deck of 52 cards?

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And he said, the nine of hearts.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I opened the video
and showed him the video.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.498 align:middle line:90%
And he lost his mind.

00:29:57.498 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he
said, you're hired.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how did it work?

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you take him to Vegas?

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We went to a casino.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:90%
This was in Florida.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say he was happy
by the end of the evening.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it works.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it works.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now here's the question
because I've asked Gallenberger

00:30:14.157 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:90%
this too.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion,
why does it work?

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:90%
We know it does, but why?

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's energy and
frequency and information.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And anything that you
are attuned to-- it's

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:84%
like a tuning fork or
like the station analogy.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you are attuned
to that you become one with,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.067 align:middle line:84%
you have access to
the information.

00:30:37.067 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I said
it's no different if you're

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
doing this with
cards or if you're

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:90%
channeling a piece of art.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
If you could tune into
the consciousness,

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
frequency of Einstein

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and you could relax
enough and allow,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
then you could actually
tune into his genius.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the way
that energy, frequency,

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.592 align:middle line:90%
and information works.

00:30:58.592 --> 00:31:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the same
thing with the cards

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
or tuning into another
state of consciousness

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
or tuning into another person.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an openness
and a receptivity.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
there was a skill,

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
it's the ability to be
open, to be receptive,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to tune
into different stations,

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because if you tune into
a different station,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
a different frequency, then
all of the information that's

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:84%
on that station
you have access to.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Is that your radio metaphor?

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's
the radio metaphor.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Hip hop's over here.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.023 align:middle line:90%
Classical music's over here.

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And so when you go over to--

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't forget
the talk stations.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And the talk stations.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:84%
The George Noory
show is over here.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Put them in there.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you tune
over to this station,

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not like this
other one goes away.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:84%
You've taken your
attention off of it.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
quantum physics works.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like you take your
attention off of the particle.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a wave.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.062 align:middle line:84%
It becomes just pure
potential again.

00:31:53.062 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
If you put your attention on
it again, all of a sudden,

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%
then you're on that station.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like it
goes invisible then if you

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
take your attention off of it.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So many people wish they
could run into a genie

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and get some three wishes.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But can't we get those wishes
on our own and make it happen?

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, the whole
three wishes genie thing,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.660 align:middle line:90%
we've seen it in "Aladdin."

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
smart, you ask the genie.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.920 align:middle line:84%
One of your wishes is
for unlimited wishes,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:90%
which is actually really smart.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I like to say that the
idea of having three wishes

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.537 align:middle line:84%
is amazing because
you're like, oh, I

00:32:30.537 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
have this power to get
whatever it is that I want,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that I wish for.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's more powerful
than the wishes?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.796 align:middle line:84%
The genie, because the
genie has unlimited wishes.

00:32:39.796 --> 00:32:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All you want.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: All you want,
so getting to the source

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:90%
or tuning into the creator.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The creator is always more
powerful than the created.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes we get
so enamored by desiring

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to have something, to be
able to manifest something

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:90%
specific, which is great.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
human experience.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:90%
We get to enjoy things.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
personally been fascinated

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:84%
about being the genie or
what is the source by which

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:84%
all creation comes into
being, because that'd

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:90%
be like being the genie.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an old
"Twilight Zone" episode

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of a guy who was
granted three wishes.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And the genie said
to the guy, each wish

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:90%
has its own consequences.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:90%
He didn't think anything of it.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So his first wish was he
wanted omnipotent power.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
The genie turned
him into Hitler.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: [LAUGHS]
Careful what you wish for.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every wish he
had, something horrible

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:90%
would happen.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
He wanted unlimited
amounts of money.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And the genie had him born
with no arms and legs,

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:90%
but he was richer than God.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So everything-- do you find
life that way with consequences?

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I mean, life,
this is a learning environment,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, there's
consequences.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I think in the example
that you're giving here,

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
it's a matter of being clear
about what it is that we want,

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we
desire, and why.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And knowing
how to get it.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, and
knowing how to get it.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is divine union?

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Divine union is
a state of consciousness,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.315 align:middle line:90%
whereby we are in union.

00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like I said, God
mode or unity consciousness

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.630 align:middle line:84%
where we're in union with
source with the God within

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:90%
and union with our own soul.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can experience divine
union on a human level

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:84%
when we're in a state
of pure intimacy,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
pure transparency where we're
connected to someone's heart,

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:84%
connected heart to
heart, soul to soul.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's less or no
distortion between us.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a state of divine union.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that looking at this

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.920 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of
masculine and feminine,

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:84%
even when we're in a flow state
in this like, peak performance

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness,
I would liken that

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to being in a state
of divine union,

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:90%
because even though it's very--

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
like, performance is
very masculine-oriented.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with creation and
accomplishing and doing things.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:84%
When we're in a flow
state and having

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
these miraculous, amazing
performances, for example,

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:84%
we're actually in
a state of unity.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And even though we're focused
in a very masculine way,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
we're also humble and open and
receptive at the same time.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And so another
way to describe it

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is where the masculine and the
feminine are united within us,

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that's the state of union.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
consciousness mean to you, O?

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Consciousness
is everything.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything we're experiencing
is in consciousness.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Like right now as we
sit here in this room,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
this is one experience
in consciousness.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
When we go into a
dream state at night,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that's another experience
in consciousness.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
When we go into our
imagination, that's

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:84%
another experience
in consciousness.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So we can't escape
that everything

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:90%
is happening in consciousness.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so all motion,
all manifestation,

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
all possibilities are existing
in the field of consciousness.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And, essentially, we
are consciousness.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And then we have a soul.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're a unique soul
or a unique, you could say,

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
configuration in consciousness.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then that
comes down to our--

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:84%
then there's our own, sort
of, our personality and then

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:90%
our unique gifts.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness is
the nature of existence.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How powerful is it?

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it's almost like
it's beyond power or powerful.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond the
concept of powerful

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.900 align:middle line:84%
because it essentially is the
essence of everything, right?

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we are able to
tune into consciousness.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Even the phrase "the state
of consciousness," states,

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:84%
this is different
manifestations.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But there are different
states in consciousness.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
That just goes to show
that consciousness is all

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:90%
encompassing.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Then there's different
states of consciousness

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that we can tune into,
different manifestations.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Relationships of
dependence, independence,

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
interdependence, union,
they're considered

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to be stages of consciousness.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, as we evolve in
life, as we're evolving souls

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and we evolve through
life, relationship

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most potent,
incredible, and potentially

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
challenging ways that we
evolve because relationships

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:90%
are like a mirror.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to
victim mode, at some point,

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
we've all probably experienced
codependency, where

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:90%
we have externalized our power.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And we are somewhat
dependent on someone else.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we evolve into
a state of independence.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
We realize that we're
these sovereign beings

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and independent of someone else.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And then if we continue to
awaken and continue to evolve,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
we come into a state
of interdependence

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.723 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
into a state of union.

00:38:13.723 --> 00:38:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm describing
the same thing,

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
but describing it through
human relationship.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And at each stage,
going from independence

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.030 align:middle line:84%
to interdependence,
really, it's like we're

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:30.540 align:middle line:84%
coming into greater union with
the whole of us, essentially.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you
speak before these days?

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Do companies call you and say,
my sales department is not

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.110 align:middle line:90%
manifesting sales, help?

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: More and
more, that's happening.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm usually speaking
with the CEO or the owner

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.217 align:middle line:84%
or the person that's
high up in the company.

00:38:47.217 --> 00:38:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One on one?

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, one on
one or in small groups.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like
behind the scenes,

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:90%
like a Yoda helping them.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But more in the last
two or three years,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been brought in to help
teams to develop leadership,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to help companies come into
flow states, to train leaders.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has surprised
you about this ability?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Just that
anything truly is possible,

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and that our--

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.215 align:middle line:84%
my mind, our human minds
cannot even conceive of being

00:39:20.215 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:90%
limitless and being--

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.873 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever think
of running for politics?

00:39:23.873 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, but I think
there's a politician named

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Orrin--

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:28.420 align:middle line:90%
or a Senator named Orrin Hatch.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hatcher.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, Hatcher.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there you go.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hatcher, I think.

00:39:32.253 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, I mean,
maybe just playfully,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:40.176 align:middle line:84%
what would it be
like to be president?

00:39:40.176 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have your
finger on the pulse.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I do feel that.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could
feel that from you.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I
feel very tapped

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
into human consciousness
and human evolution

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:90%
and what's emerging.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I could be
a good politician.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying no to that.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:90%
But like in this moment--

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say to a couple, O,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.920 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship where they
butt heads all the time?

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.378 align:middle line:84%
How could you get them to come
in to meet on solid ground?

00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I mean,
if they're butting heads,

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I would help them to butt
hearts instead of butting heads.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when couples
are butting heads,

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:84%
one or both people
are feeling unsafe

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:90%
and feeling disempowered.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to come
back into a sense of safety

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:84%
in their own hearts and come
back into a sense of power.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And the process of butting
heads or arguing is like--

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.230 align:middle line:84%
spiritually speaking,
it's an invitation back

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.590 align:middle line:84%
into love, back into truth, back
into a sense of empowerment.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I've worked with many
couples in many different ways.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But, usually, it
involves somehow

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:84%
or in some way going
from the head, which

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.812 align:middle line:84%
is where the fear is
happening, back into the heart.

00:40:58.812 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we take this journey
from the head to the heart

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and we kind of let
down our defenses,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
get back in our heart,
move through a space

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of vulnerability, then
it goes from battling

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:84%
in something that's complex
back to simple things.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Like, I care about you.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
coach sports, what was

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
the kind of sports you coached?

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I coached football,
basketball, and track

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and then got out
of coaching sports.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And now I coach leaders
and high performers.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to guess
you had a successful record

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:90%
as a sports coach.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I did, yes.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did I know that?

00:41:37.242 --> 00:41:38.575 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: How did you know that?

00:41:38.575 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
How could you know that?

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I could tell.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I could tell.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you have an
ability to motivate players

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.050 align:middle line:84%
or to take an average
player and make them

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:90%
a little above average.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I'm remembering
one of the first sports teams

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that I coached, the basketball
team that people didn't think

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:90%
were going to win many games.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:01.267 align:middle line:84%
And we started out the
season doing pretty good,

00:42:01.267 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:90%
getting better and better.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.933 align:middle line:84%
And we had this one
game in particular

00:42:03.933 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:84%
where at halftime, we were--
this was a basketball game.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.985 align:middle line:84%
We were down by 40
points, which is a lot.

00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At halftime?

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: At halftime,
we were down--

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
we were down by--

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Game over.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK,
the game is over.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no, I take that back.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
We were down by 20
points at halftime.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I did one of those halftime
speeches from my soul--

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knute Rockne.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.395 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --like you
see in the movies.

00:42:30.395 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And we went back out
in the second half.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We wound up losing
the game by 2 points.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But it was such a big win
because my team unified,

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and they gave everything
that they had.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we celebrated
that as a win.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, a few weeks
later, we wound up

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:84%
playing the same team again
that beat us by 2 points, that

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:90%
had us down by 20 at half time.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And we beat them by 40 points.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I took a, quote unquote,
"average group of guys."

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
the languaging that I

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:84%
do now about consciousness
and spirit and whatnot,

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.490 align:middle line:84%
but essentially inspired,
awakened something inside

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of them a power beyond
themselves, inside of them,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and the power of togetherness
and the power of team.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have people gotten
emotional in front of you

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:84%
where they just
broke down and cried?

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes,
quite a few times,

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.280 align:middle line:84%
sometimes without me
even saying anything.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you, O?

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.235 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I am all over the
social medias, on Instagram.

00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're asking?

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.390 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I'm on
Instagram at Oren Harris,

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:10%
O-R-E-N H-A-R-R-I-S. My
website is orenharris.com.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.455 align:middle line:10%
I'm on Facebook at Oren Harris.

00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're everywhere.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I'm everywhere.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you do private
sessions with people?

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I do when
I have time, yes.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I have a certain amount
of one-on-one clients

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:90%
that I can work with at a time.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I also host group
programs and masterminds

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm available
for speaking as well.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we born
with this ability?

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Or is it developed?

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Both.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.560 align:middle line:90%
We're born with it.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:90%
It's innate.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:90%
That's why I like children.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look at a
baby learning to walk,

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
there is an intelligence
present there

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:84%
before they have accumulated
a certain amount of judgment.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They just do it.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's like
a baby learning to walk.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the
experiment, trial and error,

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:90%
learning at a quantum rate.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the genius
capacity to learn.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.490 align:middle line:84%
It just usually gets
trained out of us.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
we're all born genius.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:10%
And to use the example of
a baby learning to walk,

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:10%
what I mean by pure genius is
they're not judging themselves

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:10%
for succeeding or failing.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're just purely
in the act of creation

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and experimentation.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.357 align:middle line:84%
And we all have that capacity
because we came in with it.

00:44:55.357 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So I believe-- I don't
remember what the quote is.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
But that we're all--

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:02.235 align:middle line:84%
everyone's born a genius
until life "degeniuses" them.

00:45:02.235 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure who said that.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:03.800 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The power
of consciousness.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, sir.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So how would you like to
do a little experiment

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.290 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness?

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:10.457 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd love to try it.

00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Give me a shot.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: All right, so
I'm going to pick a number.

00:45:13.725 --> 00:45:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a good challenge
because there's so many things

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.160 align:middle line:90%
happening in this space.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This reminds me of
Uri Geller on the Johnny Carson

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:23.950 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.235 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's
go with the nine

00:45:27.235 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the number
I chose in my experiment.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your favorite number.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.333 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: All right.

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.437 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:45:42.437 --> 00:45:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did it.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Nine of
hearts experiment.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can
see it on the camera,

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't thinking.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:10%
But right when the
nine of hearts came,

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:10%
your leg went like that.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's what my eye caught.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:58.707 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:45:58.707 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did it?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.340 align:middle line:90%
You or me?

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Both of us.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Teamwork.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm thinking, oh,
that means the card is there.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm sensing,
it stood out to me.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.797 align:middle line:90%
Your foot went like that.

00:46:13.797 --> 00:46:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And I turned the card over,
and it's the nine of hearts.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The power of
mass consciousness.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:84%
O, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You truly are
an inspirational person.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I appreciate that.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel how
inspirational this guy is?

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:10%
I can.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.280 align:middle line:10%
It just glows.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:10%
But I bet you can too.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.030 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:41.380 align:middle line:90%
