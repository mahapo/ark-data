welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Paul O'Brien's with us, a
visionary entrepreneur who

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:10%
invented a new
category of software

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
back in 1989 that evolved to
become the world's largest

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:10%
online astrology and
divination business.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
How did you do this?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.543 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL O'BRIEN: Pure luck.

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, basically--

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The stars
were with you.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS]
The stars were with me.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It was intuition.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:10%
You know, I was fascinated
by two things in my youth,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:10%
the "I Ching," which is
the ancient Daoist "Book

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:10%
of Changes," and software.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I became fascinated
with software in the 1970s

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
before Apple computer
even existed, and then

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
became the executive
of a software company

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was
in my late 30s.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself using the "I
Ching" more often than usual.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And so these two things
that fascinated me,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
one day a light bulb
went off and I thought,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
jeez, I wish I could
do this on my computer.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:90%
And we were a Macintosh shop.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And so that's
kind of like the precursor

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:90%
of multimedia computers.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I hired a
programmer and an artist,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and I did it out of my pocket
out of sheer fascination.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was the most accidental
entrepreneur ever.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I just did it out of love.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you dabble with
astrology yourself, Paul?

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh I was into
astrology since the '60s,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.217 align:middle line:90%
but not in any serious way.

00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't call
yourself an astrologer?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, no.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.757 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an astrologer.

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:54.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It was the "I
Ching" that guided me.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It was the "I Ching" that caused
me to become an entrepreneur.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I added
Tarot cards to that,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
which is another form
of divination system.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I added
astrology on top of that,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.920 align:middle line:84%
just because it was more
popular and AOL wanted it.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.625 align:middle line:10%
>>O'BRIEN: And then we
became the exclusive provider

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:10%
of all these kinds
of things, including

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:10%
horoscopes and astrology,
for AOL and Yahoo,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and Google in the early
days when they had a gadget.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:10%
So that's what basically
drove everything.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It was quite--

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say accidental,
but kind of a destiny thing.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, you know, I
have astrologers on my radio

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
show "Coast to Coast
AM" quite often.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've always
wondered, how do they

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
so quickly get this
information about a caller who

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
calls in and says, you know, I
was born, da, da, da, da, da.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they've got it.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It's your software
they're using, right?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Somebody's
software for sure.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they-- do you
just plug in the birth date,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:90%
and that's it?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.927 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a great
business, because you'd

00:02:52.927 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
get somebody's birthday, which
is their time and date of birth

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and their place of
birth, and that gives you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
a snapshot of the sky from the
point of view of where they

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
were born at the
moment they were born,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
which is considered to be
a seminal important moment,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
the moment of your first breath.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And so then you read
the sky, and you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:90%
read the energy of the moment.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
what astrology does.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
It's actually astronomy.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a map of the
sky at that moment in time,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and then the astrology's the
way you interpret the angles

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.312 align:middle line:90%
between the planets, et cetera.

00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you also
wrote a book called

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.062 align:middle line:90%
"Intuitive Intelligence."

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:27.862 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about this.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.538 align:middle line:10%
>>O'BRIEN: "Intuitive
Intelligence"

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.215 align:middle line:10%
is a book that I
was asked to write

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:10%
to describe how I did what
I did in terms of starting

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:10%
this business in my
basement with no family

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:10%
money, no investors.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just you.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Just me and a few other
people that I hired.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it grew to become
the largest astrology

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
business in the world,
but it took 13 years.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I basically starved
for 13 years.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:90%
So basically, it was the--

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a book about how I
made the decisions that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to leave a
high-paying executive

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
position to pursue something
that was meaningful for me.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the story of a
man who left money for meaning,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
and then the money came anyway.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: So it's a good story.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
least expect it, right?

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I was never money motivated.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I left a very high-paying
job to do this thing

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
that I thought would be
cool, something that I

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
thought that I would get a lot
of personal fulfillment out of.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have to leave it?

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Could you have done
both in retrospect?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You couldn't.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I had--

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I continued to do
moonlighting for that company

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
as an international
marketing consultant

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep
some cash flowing

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
until I got a product
out, but you know,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of hard to--

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you were that
cash poor in those days.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Totally.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Totally.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have anything in my
checking account for 13 years,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.852 align:middle line:90%
but I managed to pay my people.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I managed to maintain--

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You struggled.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: --my mortgage.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.075 align:middle line:90%
Oh, unbelievable.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many nightmares
of going bankrupt.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But I was driven, and I
was driven by my heart.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the moral of the story.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you expect somebody
to buy the software package

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:90%
from you as a company?

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:90%
I had no exit strategy.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.182 align:middle line:84%
Never assumed it would
be worth that much.

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
You know, "I Ching" software.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell knows
what the "I Ching" is?

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
would use it, right?

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS] I
mean, people in the West

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:90%
don't really know what it is.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards are 10
times more popular.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And the astrology's
10 times more popular

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of all
in the same category.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I call it divination.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I now run the
Divination Foundation,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%
to explain about this stuff.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, no, no.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:90%
I never expected it--

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
my dream, George, I called
it creative freedom.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant
to me was the ability

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to make a living doing
something I cared about.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Nothing more than that.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Not paying off the mortgage.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.262 align:middle line:84%
I never even dreamt
about doing that.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just wanted
to make a living doing

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:90%
something I cared about.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you
liked and enjoyed.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess I threw
caution to the wind.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
My only safety net
was the fact that I

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
had 15 years'
experience in high tech,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and I could always-- felt like I
could probably go back to that.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, intuition is
a powerful tool.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:90%
You obviously had it.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
In our Gaia program
"Missing Links,"

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden talks about
the power of intuition.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN: This
whole idea of intuition,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:10%
it's a very powerful sense.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:10%
It is a knowing,
a direct knowing,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:10%
our heart's knowing of when
something is true for us

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.435 align:middle line:10%
and when it's not.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:10%
And we have to be very, very
clear about when we're actually

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:10%
hearing information
from her heart

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.588 align:middle line:10%
or whether the information
is coming from there,

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:10%
or maybe it's coming
from the subconscious,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:10%
or maybe it's coming
from a fear, or--

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:10%
it's just good to be very clear
about where this information is

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:10%
coming from.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me all the time,
when I speak at live events.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They ask me to make
decisions for them

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and to interpret their
experiences for them

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.713 align:middle line:84%
that I could never decide
and I could never interpret,

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
because the experiences
have happened to them.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give you an example.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:10%
It's very common for people to
ask me, Gregg, I had a dream

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:10%
last night.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.745 align:middle line:10%
And in the dream-- and
they're very detailed.

00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:05.545 align:middle line:90%
I saw this.

00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I saw that.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.105 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, what does
this dream mean?

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I have to say to
them very honestly and very

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
factually is, I couldn't
begin to tell you

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:90%
what that dream means.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have the dream.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:10%
You had the dream.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying this
to you right now.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:10%
If you are powerful enough to
have the kinds of dreams that

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:10%
are so vivid and so lucid
that you remember them

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:10%
even in your waking hours,
then you are powerful enough

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:10%
to ask your own body,
to ask your intuition,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:10%
to ask your heart, what
does this dream mean for me?

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:10%
What am I being
shown in this dream?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:10%
Why am I being shown
what I'm showing?

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean in my life?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Ask those kinds of questions.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them, if you will
ask them from your heart rather

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:90%
than your brain.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So my buddy, Gregg
Braden, he goes a great job,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
doesn't he?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.763 align:middle line:84%
His hair is almost as high
as Giorgio Tsoukalos's

00:07:57.763 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:90%
from "Ancient Aliens."

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS]

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what do you
think of what he said?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I think
it's right on.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
like the intuition

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is a higher form of intelligence
that's coming from the heart.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And he mentions the
heart, and he also

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.112 align:middle line:90%
is talking about self-knowledge.

00:08:12.112 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:84%
These are things I
talk about in my book.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's all these
forms of intelligence,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.908 align:middle line:84%
You have the intellectual
intelligence, the IQ,

00:08:17.908 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the emotional intelligence,
social intelligence,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:90%
erotic intelligence.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And
intuitive intelligence

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence
of the heart.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
of a higher order.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's dealing with
a much bigger picture

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
than the ego normally
is dealing with.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And talk about dream
interpretation.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course,
you need intuition

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what a
dream means for yourself.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
visionary decision making?

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Visionary
decision making

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
is a term that I came up with to
describe the method of decision

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
making that I use
with big decisions,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
including the one to
become an entrepreneur.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
driven by the heart.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It's driven by
intuitive intelligence.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.113 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gut instinct too?

00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:03.913 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:09:03.913 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, gut instinct is how
intuitive intelligence

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:90%
shows up.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Generally shows up as a feeling.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:90%
It could be a physical feeling.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
It could be a vision.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- some people
are auditory that way.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it's an instinct.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it was
called the sixth sense

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So like, we have
the five senses,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:84%
like the five fingers of the
hand, the visual, et cetera.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you have a dinky little
finger over here, a sixth one.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the intuitive antenna.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what I call it.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's very delicate,
and it's calibrated

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
to a very fine signal.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So you can't hear.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like he said.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
got to-- you've got

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to be clear about where the
information is coming from.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.047 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Is it
coming from fear?

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from the senses?

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Or is it coming from your heart?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.417 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very--

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that takes a lot of sensitivity,
and you've got to quiet down.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
have this ability, Paul,

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to tap into this visionary
decision making process?

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well,
visionary decision making

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is a skill set
that involves logic

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:90%
and it involves intuition.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
are better than others.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
better than others,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:90%
but everybody has the capacity.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has the
capacity to be intuitive,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:84%
but not very many people ever
access it to any great extent

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
because we're so
distracted all the time.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:90%
We're so busy.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are
chattering away, and we

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
don't have-- we don't
create the space

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to be receptive to
such sensitive signals.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your work is tied
into a lot of the work

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:90%
of Carl Jung, the psychologist.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.078 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that involvement.

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, he helped
me understand and has helped

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
so many people understand
the nature of the mind

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
the subconscious.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:90%
He called it--

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Freud thought of the
unconscious as being

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
this reservoir of all of
these primitive drives

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
and animalistic instincts.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And Jung said, wait a minute.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
to it than that.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
There's-- where does
creativity come from?

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Where does intuition come from?

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Where do-- where does these
creative, bigger picture

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:90%
things come from?

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And he called it the
collective unconscious.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was his definition of
the unconscious, which was way

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
beyond the personal unconscious
that Freud was talking about

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that we share across
cultures, through mythology

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and symbology.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jung and
Freud knew each other,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.902 align:middle line:84%
and they were
rivals, weren't they?

00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well,
actually, Jung was

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
kind of a protege of Freud's
until they broke apart

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
over Freud's coming up
with the death instinct

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to define why people
are destructive or

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
self-destructive.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:90%
And Jung said he--

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
agree with that.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, he
didn't agree with that,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.195 align:middle line:84%
and so Freud sort of
kicked him out of the--

00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
they were at odds.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
unfortunate, because they

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:90%
were both geniuses.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.605 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:50.405 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the groundbreaking
concept of synchronicity

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:90%
came from Jung too, didn't it?

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, he
coined that term.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And he specifically
coined it to describe

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:84%
how the "I Ching" works, which
he studied for, like, 30 years.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And Tarot cards too.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
"I Ching" mean?

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: "I Ching"
means "Book of Changes."

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the oldest
book in the world.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient Daoist text,
but it's more than a book.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a divination system.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So people toss coins
and get a pattern,

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and then they look up
that-- around a question

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're meditating on
while they're tossing the coins.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they look up
that pattern in a book.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what synchronicity
means is that there

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:84%
are no accidents, that this
is a meaningful coincidence.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The way that the
coins land is related

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to everything else that's
happening in that moment,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's interpreted by
the book specifically

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what you're
thinking about when you do it.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we determine
how the coins land?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Is us that's doing it?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Energetically, yes.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I developed
"I Ching" software, which

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is really what started me
out as an entrepreneur,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I made sure that there was a
way to cast the hexagram that

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
was energetically authentic.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Because when you're casting--

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
nobody could cast
the coins for you.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like Gregg Braden said.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Other people can't necessarily
interpret your dreams for you,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
the body of self-knowledge

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%
that you have about yourself.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But so the energy,
the way the coins land

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:90%
is related to your energy.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't control it.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.372 align:middle line:90%
Seems completely random.

00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's much more
connected to you

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
than if you hit a
button on a computer

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and have it spit out six lines.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
generating those six lines

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
through something you're
doing is having an effect.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:90%
It's having an impact on that.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're an agent of this
meaningful coincidence

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:90%
that you're creating.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is "I Ching" Chinese?

00:13:37.057 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a Daoist classic.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the five
Daoist classics.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It's about 3,000 years
old, and it's from China.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it as kind
of a Chinese form of Tarot

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
cards, except that
it doesn't use cards.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Although I've
created a card deck for it

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
just recently.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But it uses coins and a
book, but it's the same idea.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that
work with the coins?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, you
cast the coins six times,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and the way the coin--
three coins land,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
there's four ways
three coins can land.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.793 align:middle line:84%
You get three heads,
three tails, two heads,

00:14:11.793 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and a tail, two tails and-- so
you mark down what kind of line

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.477 align:middle line:90%
you got.

00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If it's three of a kind, that's
kind of a special thing that's

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.162 align:middle line:90%
called a changing line.

00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:90%
So you mark down the pattern.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.287 align:middle line:90%
You do that six times.

00:14:21.287 --> 00:14:22.503 align:middle line:90%
It's a six-line pattern.

00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just toss them.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.587 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You just toss them.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And you could use a cup
and shake them in a cup.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
as long as you're

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:90%
the one that's tossing them.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And so then you
look it up in the book.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you
have certain patterns,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:90%
does it happen regularly?

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: It can.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's--

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
patterns tell you what?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, they're
going to give you some insight

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and some advice relative to
what you were meditating on

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
just before you cast the coins.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
So you want to be--

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.553 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You want
to be one-pointed.

00:14:55.553 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You want to be focused on
whatever dilemma or decision

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:84%
or relationship you're
wondering about.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the coins
telling you what to do,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
or are you doing it as an
experiment to test yourself?

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I think of
divination as a way

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate your
intuition, to think

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
outside the box around problems
that logic can't handle.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So if logic can
handle it, use logic.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for logic.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole
chapter in my book,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
"Intuitive Intelligence," on
logic and a really easy way

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to use logic as part of the
visionary decision making

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But the kind of
issues that you might

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
want to use the "I Ching"
for are relationship issues,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
negotiating, timing
issues, office politics.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
All the kinds of things that
logic really can't handle.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the biggest
issues in our lives

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
are issues that
logic can't handle.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
archetypes, Paul?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Archetypes are-- that
was also another concept that

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%
was defined by Carl Jung.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are
energy configurations

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
related to the human condition.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in Tarot
cards, you've got 78 cards.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Each card is an archetype.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
In the "I Ching," there's
64 possible hexagrams

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:90%
that you can get.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those
is an archetype.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's an energy
pattern that reflects

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
on a situation or a
personality, the current moment.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about
the present moment,

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and archetypes are a way to--

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:90%
they're like subpersonalities.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
We have all of the
archetypes inside of us.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you bring up an
archetype using the "I

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Ching" like one of the 64
hexagrams or a Tarot card,

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that's pointing to something
that's inside of you.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:90%
You've got a warrior in there.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:90%
You've got a king in there.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
You've got a magician in there.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.192 align:middle line:84%
You've got a-- you know,
there's all the archetypes--

00:16:48.192 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Working away for us.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.358 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, they're
in there all the time,

00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of times, we're
not-- we're not awake to them.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way
of stimulating--

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
it's a way of calling up
archetypes and then tapping

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
into their power.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a show on
Gaia called "Sacred Power,"

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and Caroline Myss, of course,
talked about archetypes

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's check in with her.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: She's
famous for that.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROLINE MYSS: What your
knowledge of your archetypes

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
gives you is this
capacity to be impersonal

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
about the personal events
that unfold in your life.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
How much power is that?

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about
sacred power, this

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
is like the apex
of that position.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
This is like Plato said when he
said the gods are archetypes.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:10%
They live like Zeus at
the top of Mount Olympus,

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:10%
looking upon us, but they
are patterns of power.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
A soul journey is the
journey with your soul.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:10%
It requires that you need
your soul to endure it.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:10%
Emphasis on the word endure.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:10%
It is a make-or-break journey.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You will reach a
point in this journey

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
where you understand
you may not make it.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:90%
You may not make it.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean necessarily
that you may not live,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:10%
but you may not live well.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You may live with this sense
that you are just surviving.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you decide, I've
got to heal this no matter

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:84%
what, and I've got
to find resources

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
in me that I didn't know I had.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.674 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's kind of
difficult to live, isn't it?

00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:44.658 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS] Well--

00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She didn't give
you much uplifting hope.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.198 align:middle line:84%
No, well, these
are difficult times

00:18:50.198 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in right now.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And she's
talking about how

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
you could tap into
these sources of power,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:90%
which are the archetypes.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So the gods and
the various deities

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and the various different
kinds of archetypal patterns,

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
we have them inside
of ourselves,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and we can tap into them, and
we can go beyond just surviving,

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have to.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can find
strength in that.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have to.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.958 align:middle line:84%
Do you use these techniques
a lot for yourself?

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:19.792 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah.

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, especially right now.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are hard
times for everybody.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything's more
difficult right now.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.407 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all being kind
of cast back upon ourselves--

00:19:29.407 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we're being tested.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: We're being
tested, for sure.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a spiritual
retreat in a way,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:90%
or an initiation.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is the opportunity
to get to know ourselves

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and to call upon
these inner powers

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to be more resilient,
to not just survive, but to be

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
resilient and to ultimately
be better for it.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we
as individuals all

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:90%
be practicing "I Ching" often?

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.965 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I think
any time that--

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I know for me, any
time I have a problem

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that logic can't handle,
I consult the "I Ching."

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I've used the "I Ching"
for every major decision

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
in my adult life,
since I was 19.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean it's
telling me what to do.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:10%
It's giving me insight and
it's giving me timeless advice,

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:10%
and it's helping me
think outside the box

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:10%
so that I know that there's
a creative solution that I

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:10%
haven't thought of yet.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't care
what my ego wants to hear.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of these hexagrams
are not that pleasant.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of them,
you know, splitting

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:90%
apart or whatever.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
They give you lessons or they
make you think about things.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, we tend to think
in black and white, George,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
and that's a problem these days.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem all the time.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So this helps us remember
that there's always

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
a third solution.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
It's never just black and white.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you give
us an example, Paul,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of how you tap into the "I
Ching," how you get into it?

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I don't use it that
often, because I don't have--

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, but for--

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.043 align:middle line:84%
I use it a lot
for relationships.

00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to have
the coins with you, or cards?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: No, I actually
created an app that

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
is a really good way to do it.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I've, like-- like I was saying,
I had created software in 1989.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But now we have an
app, the divination--

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it called?

00:21:09.155 --> 00:21:11.992 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's called Visionary
I Ching, and it's an app.

00:21:11.992 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can find
it in your app store.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And you just--

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.362 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: That's a very
convenient way to do it,

00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%
and I that's the way I use it.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
really matter how you

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
do it as long as it's
energetically authentic, as

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
long as it's you
creating that pattern.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
process to get into the "I

00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.092 align:middle line:90%
Ching," the right way?

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You know, the
beautiful thing about the "I

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Ching," George, is you don't
need a lot of training.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards, you have
to study for years.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, yeah.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: If you want to
learn those archetypes--

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still
don't know them.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But the "I Ching's" a book,
so it's got 64 chapters.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And you look it up in the book.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
intuition comes

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
in in a very practical
way, because you

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
read between the
lines and you apply

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
what it's saying to whatever
the issue or question that you

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.128 align:middle line:90%
brought to it.

00:21:55.128 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
I'll just do it--

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll just-- like, let's say
that I'm in a relationship

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and I want some advice on how
to approach the other person.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.815 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's my child
who hasn't come home

00:22:06.815 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and was supposed to
be home by midnight

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's 1:30 in the morning--

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're panicking.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I want to get some--

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to calm down.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like a form of
meditation, but it's

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:84%
like a two-wave
form of meditation,

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's giving me some
wisdom on the way back.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I might say,
what's the best approach

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to take vis-a-vis my son
or vis-a-vis my girlfriend

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And so it helps
me, because you know, like,

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
in the martial arts-- and kind
of related to the martial arts,

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
because martial arts
wisdom came from Daoism.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes there's
a time to assert yourself.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a time to do
nothing and let the dark clouds

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%
pass.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a time to
run like hell and retreat.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the "I Ching" knows
this, but we don't know this.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, we don't know it.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
In Western society, we
just-- we're Type A.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.945 align:middle line:84%
We've got to fix
it now, and that's

00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:90%
our approach to everything.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it just
helps you chill out.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it helps you--

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let
things just happen.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's a matter of timing.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.233 align:middle line:90%
It's all about time management.

00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have some "I
Ching" cards that you developed,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.653 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, we
recently developed

00:23:09.653 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
"I Ching" cards through
Beyond Words Publishing,

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because an artist approached
me, and she had 64 paintings

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:90%
for each of the hexagrams.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.455 align:middle line:84%
And I-- the "I
Ching's" never been

00:23:20.455 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:90%
illustrated in its history.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
a look at one of the cards,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell us
what we're looking at.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: OK.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this, Paul?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: This is the
archetype of the well.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is hexagram number 48.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And this one symbolizes the
deep sources of nourishment

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that are available within
us and maybe around us.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a reminder
to turn towards our sources

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
of nourishment.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do
you do with the card?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, the card is just
an inspirational byproduct.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a booklet that
comes with the card deck.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And you turn to
number 48, and you'd

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
look up the text
for this, and then

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
you'd correlate it in your mind
with whatever you were asking.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you picking
the card out of a deck?

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Just like Tarot cards.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:90%
You just shuffle the cards.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you
get it, then there's

00:24:18.047 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:90%
a significant meaning behind it?

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.662 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, that's
the idea of synchronicity

00:24:21.662 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
meaningful coincidence.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
The card you draw when you're
thinking about something,

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:90%
that's a coincidence.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's meaningful
according to synchronicity,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:90%
as if there are no accidents.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What motivated
you to do this?

00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: The cards?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The cards.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, actually,
it was the publisher's idea.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:90%
They said--

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They always come up
with good ideas sometimes.

00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Sometimes they do.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And they thought a card deck
would be a really cool thing

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to have, and I thought,
well, why not, you know?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I had an illustrated "I Ching."

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
My app's got the
art in it, and so

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
does my ebook of the
Visionary "I Ching,"

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
so it was a natural progression.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is somebody doing
wrong if they try all this

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and it just doesn't
work for them?

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:90%
What's not clicking?

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well,
they're probably

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
asking the wrong kind of
question to begin with.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: You know?

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't want
to ask the "I Ching,"

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
what's the weather going
to be like tomorrow?

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Or where should I go to lunch?

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Or even something like,
what's the meaning of life?

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It's basically
designed to answer

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of question,
which is looking for strategy

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
or insight or
advice, as if you're

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
talking to a mentor or a
sage and you're saying,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
what's the best approach
to take vis-a-vis x?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what type
of question would you ask?

00:25:41.517 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Just like that.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
What's the best approach
to take vis-a-vis my boss?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Then how do you get your answer?

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Then you cash the
coins and you look it up.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Throw them out there.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: And you look it up.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Match it to the book.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And then usually, you'll be
able to make some sense of it

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
question that you asked.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind of
a matter of practice,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
but there's going to be some
wisdom in there for you.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
time, for me, it's

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
uncannily accurate in terms
of what it tells me to do.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it almost like
rolling dice in Vegas?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a little
bit more behind it?

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, it's a little
more intricate than that,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:90%
but it's the same concept.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you say--

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.627 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you can--

00:26:33.627 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
although when you're
rolling dice in Vegas--

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on, seven.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's right.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.625 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to roll
a seven or an 11.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.125 align:middle line:84%
You know, with the
"I Ching," you're

00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
not trying to roll
anything in particular.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You're basically open to
getting some insight or advice

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a different--

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a different
thing to do altogether

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:90%
with a different intentionality.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So your intention in
casting the "I Ching"

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
or doing Tarot cards
or anything like that

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:90%
is to learn something.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So it really hinges
on receptivity.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't cast the
dice in Vegas just

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:90%
to see what you're going to get.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You cast the dice in Vegas with
a lot of attachment to outcome.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.498 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And the only outcome
you want from the "I Ching"

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
is to learn something
that's going to help

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:90%
you operate more skillfully.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why is
synchronicity so important

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:90%
in this?

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.338 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well,
synchronicity's the definition

00:27:22.338 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:90%
of perfect timing.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity basically
says that everything

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:84%
is related in time, not just in
space, not just in the material

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Everything is related in time.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, Western science
doesn't even credit that.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
If you do a controlled
experiment on Tuesday night

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and you do that same controlled
experiment Friday morning,

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
you expect to get
exactly the same results.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That's because time is
factored out of the equation.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But in the most
important issues of life,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.572 align:middle line:90%
timing is really important.

00:27:48.572 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why they say
timing is everything.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
sages were trying

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
to answer a different question.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying to figure
out what things are made of,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:84%
which is what Western science
and logic is really good at,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.655 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to figure
out, what kind of things

00:28:00.655 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:90%
go together in time?

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:90%
When should we do this ritual?

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
When should we
launch this campaign?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.823 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's the best
approach to take right now?

00:28:08.823 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And you've used this to change
your own life, haven't you?

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well,
I use it to make--

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to have a better
relationship with change.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Change is the only
constant in life.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Things are always changing.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And things are changing
faster than ever now.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
The accelerating rate
of change is crazy.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And then you think about these--

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
the level of uncertainty
that we feel.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
That's enough to
drive you crazy,

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and it is driving a
lot of people crazy.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of people crazy.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
anxiety, et cetera.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So to develop a better
relationship with change

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and start to cultivate what
I call the visionary belief

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that change is your
friend and that everything

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
happens for a reason--

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
ideas I cannot prove, but
they're very useful beliefs,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:84%
because they help me make
peace with the here and now,

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
no matter how screwed up things
are or no matter how confusing

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.570 align:middle line:90%
things are.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So to have a good
relationship with change

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.441 align:middle line:84%
and with life which
is always changing

00:29:09.441 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual practice.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you do
this, do you do it

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.787 align:middle line:84%
in the privacy of
your own domain?

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to do this as sort of
a meditation, not where you're

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:84%
going to be interrupted
or distracted.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not in a
public forum or anything.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.097 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No, no, no.

00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:27.480 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- it's
not a performance.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a
form of meditation.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
cross between-- it's kind

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of a combination of
meditation and prayer,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.990 align:middle line:84%
because you're meditating,
which means you're letting go.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You're becoming open.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:90%
You're becoming receptive.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:90%
You're becoming quiet.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
You're quieting the
noisy, chattering mind,

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're becoming
receptive to information.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And then because it's
an interactive system,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:84%
it gives you information, and
so you receive that information.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.677 align:middle line:90%
So you're asking for help--

00:29:56.677 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to try
this, just for the heck of it.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Why not?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know it?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: That's the
beauty of the "I Ching."

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
study anything.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
any special knowledge.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to go to school.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: William
Whitecloud, of course,

00:30:07.595 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is on the Gaia program
"Inspirations,"

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about the
magic of the universe.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's see this.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: OK.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM WHITECLOUD: The kind
of success that I see largely

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.390 align:middle line:84%
being attained in the
world is achievement,

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:84%
the type of success that
I call high achievement,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
which comes from a lot
of effort and hard work--

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Will.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.905 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITECLOUD: --and
willfulness and-- you know.

00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:84%
You could even say
effort and struggle.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Whereas-- you know, and that's
one kind of achievement.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of a--
you know, in a sense,

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.085 align:middle line:90%
a pigheaded type of approach.

00:30:43.085 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, it's
how businesses

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.890 align:middle line:10%
are structured these days,
with graphs and goals

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:10%
and projections and-- yeah.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITECLOUD: Yeah.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:10%
And you know, it's
not only businesses.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.705 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of personal
achievements as well,

00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and our approach to
relationships or just life

00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:00.136 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:31:00.136 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.385 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITECLOUD: But
you see, what I

00:31:02.385 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:84%
call-- what I mean by natural
success is a success that's

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:90%
achieved through creativity.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITECLOUD: Yeah.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know, creativity
by any definition,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
really you could distill
down to the ability

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to make connections that
aren't usually made.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about any
genius who invents or creates

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:84%
anything, whether
it's Andy Warhol who--

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Andy Warhol who
does incredible silkscreens

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that are different to anything
that's ever been done before

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
or takes a can of soup and make
something iconic out of it--

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.537 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITECLOUD: --or whether
it's Einstein who figures out

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
there are black holes in space
before the radio telescopes

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that can identify
them, you see, they're

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.992 align:middle line:84%
making connections that the
average person isn't making.

00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: At the
stratospheric level.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.275 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITECLOUD: Yeah.

00:32:02.275 --> 00:32:07.885 align:middle line:84%
And so when one breaks out
of one's normal patterned way

00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, you start
making connections

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that then start making
life a whole lot

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
more effortless and
effective as well.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, the way
the conditioned mind works,

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:28.330 align:middle line:84%
it gets from A to B by
going to C to D to E

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:33.525 align:middle line:84%
to F to G to H to I to J to K,
and back around Z and back to--

00:32:33.525 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's details.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITECLOUD: And when you go
into your more creative mind,

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:84%
you just-- you start
seeing through all of that,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and you see a lot more directly.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.660 align:middle line:90%
You start seeing just how--

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:84%
how much more
directly you can go.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:10%
And you start
going from A to B--

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:10%
literally from A to B, a
whole lot more directly.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, what does
success mean to you?

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Success means
getting what you want.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.992 align:middle line:84%
The problem is most of us
don't know what we really want.

00:33:07.992 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or how to get there.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want, you know?

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You might say, well, I want a
Ferrari or I want a vacation,

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But what you really want
is the experience of joy

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:90%
or the experience of peace.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
What you really want
is an internal thing.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we're always
looking to try

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to get success by grasping
externals and thinking

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:90%
that that's going--

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that's how we calibrate
success in our society.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Money equates success.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think success is a much
deeper problem than that,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do with
knowing who you are.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like he was
saying in that clip.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:90%
You know, true success--

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
he calls it natural success--

00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
comes from-- from-- it's driven
by curiosity and the creativity

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:90%
that stems from that.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And isn't
success finding happiness?

00:34:06.907 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah,
that's what I think.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever it
is to make you happy?

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's right.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
doesn't necessarily

00:34:12.128 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:90%
have to be possessions.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Nothing
external is going

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:90%
to make you happy for very long.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is divination?

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Divination is the
category of these things.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.288 align:middle line:84%
"I Ching," Tarot
cards, rune stones--

00:34:25.288 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All under this--

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --astrology,
numerology.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:84%
This is the category
word for these things.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And a divination system is
something like the "I Ching"

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:90%
or Tarot cards that lets you--

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
gives you a way to
stimulate your intuition,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:90%
to think outside the box.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And so
that's a way to tap

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:90%
into intuitive intelligence.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote a
chapter on divination

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:10%
in the book "Intuitive
Intelligence,"

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:10%
because it's a way that I
have found so useful to tap

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:10%
into my intuition.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's kind of
hard to access intuition

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.160 align:middle line:84%
when you need it the most,
because when you need it

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the most is when
you're all upset

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:84%
or when you've
got some pressing,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
urgent problem and you
can't think straight.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't have the receptivity.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you do a
divination exercise,

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of like a meditation
practice to help you quiet down

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and open up to
better information.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think successful
people, Paul, utilize this,

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even
know they're doing it?

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, successful
people are driven by intuition.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.380 align:middle line:90%
In my view, you know?

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
times when somebody

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:84%
like Morita who was the
founder of Sony, he said,

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
all the marketing
research on Earth

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:84%
could have never told us that
the Sony Walkman was going

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:90%
to be such a huge success.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Steve Jobs said the same thing.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
He says, I don't worry
about marketing research.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's got his instinct.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Because people
don't know what they

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
want before it's available.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be
driven by intuition.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.287 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Steve Jobs was a product
visionary of the highest order.

00:35:55.287 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, tragic that
he left us way too soon.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh, for sure.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know?

00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Way too soon.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.713 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: For sure.

00:36:02.713 --> 00:36:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People like
Bill Gates and inventors,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:84%
people like yourself who came up
with the astrological software.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Because
you know, I think

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
everybody can invent a path
of success for themselves

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
through self-knowledge and by
becoming in touch with what

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:90%
fascinates them.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I said,
two things fascinated me

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:84%
in my youth, and then
15 years later, I

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:84%
had an aha moment
where I thought,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can put these
things together.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody's had
things that fascinated them.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they discounted
that because their father

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
wanted them to be a
lawyer or their mother

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.680 align:middle line:84%
wanted them to be a
doctor, or whatever.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think people can get
back to what fascinated them

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.670 align:middle line:84%
during stage one of
life, the student stage,

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:90%
no matter what age they are.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
It's never too late
to cultivate curiosity

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and to tune in to what
is meaningful for you.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Happiness is the
bottom line here, isn't it?

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's always
the bottom line.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then with happiness
comes all these other things,

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.585 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, happiness--

00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just falls into place.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Happiness
is an inside job.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:10%
I think happiness is actually
a byproduct of meaning,

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:10%
of finding your meaning in life,
doing what's meaningful for you

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:10%
and that's fulfilling for you.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:90%
That'll make you happy.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is not like some state
that you can achieve and then

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:90%
stay in that state forever.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:10%
There's happiness
and there's sadness,

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:10%
but if you're doing
something that's meaningful

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:10%
or something that helps
people and something that

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:10%
makes you happy to
get up in the morning,

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:10%
that's going to make you
happy more often than not.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Thank you, George.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.228 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know,
it's amazing how

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:10%
you can control your own
success by your inner feelings.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Use the "I Ching,"
as Paul has been

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:10%
talking about on the program.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:10%
It could better your life.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
