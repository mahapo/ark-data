00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GAIL RUBEN: Today
we're going to talk

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.900 align:middle line:84%
about what you need
to know before you go

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.520 align:middle line:84%
so that when-- not if, but when
there's a death in the family,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle line:84%
you can get through the
process with much less conflict

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and stress.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.413 align:middle line:84%
That's all starting today on
"Beyond Belief" right now.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:44.692 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.692 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:10%
You just heard it from
Gail Ruben, a subject

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:10%
that not a lot of people want
to talk about-- death, dying.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're all
going to get there, Gail.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.875 align:middle line:90%
One way or another.

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Humans have
a 100% mortality rate.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope the
trip for many of us

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
is much longer than
shorter, don't you?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Absolutely.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are so many people
afraid of talking about death,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.802 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost?

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBEN: There's this idea
that if I talk about it,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:10%
it's going to happen
sooner rather than later.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And that is not true.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is
our self-esteem,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the idea that within
ourselves, how we perceive

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:90%
the world is being fulfilled.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.469 align:middle line:90%
We avoid the topic.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the plague.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Like the plague.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:10%
So it takes good
self-esteem to be

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:10%
able to face your own
mortality and to have

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:10%
a conversation about it.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
My idea is that we
should make fun of death,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:90%
laugh in the face of death.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us the
emotional distance

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have the
conversations that we

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:90%
need to have.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many decisions that

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:90%
need to be made before we die.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't
make those decisions

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and have those conversations,
then your loved ones--

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
your spouse, your
children-- are going

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to be left in charge
of doing that.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And, face it.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.705 align:middle line:84%
Would you want your kids
planning your vacation for you?

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.522 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I don't
take many vacations.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: You need to
take some vacations.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How the
heck did you get

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:90%
involved with studying death?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
somebody wakes up and says,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm going
to do as a future.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure as a little
girl, you didn't say,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.061 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write a book called
"A Good Goodbye" about death.

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:90%
How'd this happen?

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.434 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Right.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I got married for the
second time in 2000

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and had a very creative
Jewish Western wedding.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had
such a good time.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to write a book about
creative life cycle events

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and call it "Matchings,
Hatchings, and Dispatchings."

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And I got to write a book
about-- I wrote monthly columns

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.967 align:middle line:84%
in my local newspaper about
weddings, births, and deaths.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was the columns
on funerals and death

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that got the most
reader response.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So it told me
there's a real need

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
this conversation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And humor is the way to help
break down the resistance

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:90%
to having the conversation.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And it changed the
course of my career.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I went from being
public relations

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
professional and event planner
to a certified thanatologist,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
which is a deaf educator.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Thanotology is the study of
death, dying, and bereavement.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from the
word Thanatos, which

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
was the twin brother and in
Greek mythology of Hypnos,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
which is the demigod of sleep.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Sleep and good death.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:90%
So Hypnos and Thanatos.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do we die?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Why can't the human body
go on almost indefinitely?

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: It wears out.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
There's accidents.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And anything can
happen to suddenly

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
you're not expecting
anyone to die,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
along living your life.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a death.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And if you haven't had
these kind of conversations

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:10%
about do I want
to be buried, do I

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:10%
want to be cremated, do I
want a religious funeral,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:10%
having these honest
conversations with your family

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:10%
members can leave those family
members in a heap of trouble

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:10%
when suddenly you're
hit by the big bus

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and you go to the great
beyond in the sky.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be
able to honestly have

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:90%
those conversations.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about it for
years and I'm not dead yet.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yet.

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.863 align:middle line:90%
Knock on wood.

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Yeah,
well-- but I know.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And I've preplanned.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Both my husband and I have.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people do preplan?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.709 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot.

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Only about
25% of the population,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
of the adult
population, actually

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
does advance care directives,
funeral planning, even wills.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have
100% mortality rate.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So 75% of the
population out there

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is in for a very rude
surprise when death occurs.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So it really is important
to watch this show

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and then say, hey,
I saw this show

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and we need to have
a conversation.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when somebody
is planning their own death,

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
their own funeral, do
they go to a funeral home

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.505 align:middle line:90%
and pick out a casket?

00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: That's
one way to do it.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
With the rise of the internet,
actually, funeral homes

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to realize,
hey, I need to have

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:90%
a presence on the internet.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The best thing to do is not just
go to one funeral home or two

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
funeral homes, but I
recommend going to three

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
because every funeral home
has a different personality,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
different prices, and
different offerings.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There are your steel
caskets for the people

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
who think they want their
body preserved underground.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
There are wooden caskets--

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pine boxes.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Come on, for me.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Nice and simple.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: A plain pine box.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
That really helps facilitate
being one with the Earth.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There are even more
biodegradable options

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
like wicker basket
caskets, my husband

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
does the laundry in our
family and that's his choice.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Even wool caskets.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But also just any number-- if
you're going to be cremated,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.792 align:middle line:84%
you could even have a
cardboard box, basically,

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:90%
to put into the--

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.499 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:90%
If was at a funeral once.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%
And those caskets are heavy.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And you've got your
six pallbearers.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Three on each side.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And they drop the guy.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.445 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Ohh.

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, thud.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Ohh.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The thing was so heavy.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
It was imbalanced
and stuff like that.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, and that's
an issue with our expanding

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:90%
waistline population.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Obesity.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess
he was heavy too.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That didn't help.

00:07:06.023 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: So that's extra
expensive because you have

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
to get an extra large casket.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You might have to have a
double wide burial plot.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
you might want

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
to choose cremation, that might
not be an option depending

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
on the funeral home because it's
got to be a big enough retort

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accommodate
a person of that size.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it a
little morbid, Gail,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to go to a funeral
and look and there's

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:90%
the body laid out like that.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: There are different
opinions about that.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a need to
see a dead body in a casket

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
to really get the message.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The closure?

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: The not
so much closure,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
but really recognize that
this person is actually dead.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very
visually oriented.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
My brother-in-law,
for example, said

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that he went to the
wedding of a-- wedding.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.145 align:middle line:84%
The funeral of a good
friend of the family--

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there
could have been a wedding.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.496 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Well, this--

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes a bad
wedding is like a funeral.

00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Right.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And, well, he
didn't see her body

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
so he didn't feel like
he-- he was expecting

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:90%
her to walk in at any moment.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Weddings and funerals
are very similar events.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
decisions to make.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
When is it going to happen?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Where is it going to happen?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to wear?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
invite all the people?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of the people in
your life-- think about this.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Used to be we had a dog
eared personal phone book

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen that usually mom
kept that had all the contact

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
information for everybody in
the family and the friends.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Now we have our cellphones.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%
We have our Facebook friends.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
There are all these different
ways of contacting people.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you're left
without a master

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
list of who these people are and
how to get in touch with them,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
you could very easily overlook
a very important person

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
get in touch with

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to let them know
about the funeral.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
In the old days
we had newspapers.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
read the obituary column.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And you would know
where the funeral was

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and how the person died
and who his relatives were

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:90%
and his next of kin.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Are people reading newspapers?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Are they tracking the obits?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, of
course the newspapers

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
are undergoing a massive
change with the internet.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge change.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: So there are still the
obituary columns and our older

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
population are the
people who are reading

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:90%
the newspapers in paper form.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We have our tablets
and the obituaries

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
are also appearing online.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole trend in a major
company taking these obituaries

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and putting them on
their own website

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.836 align:middle line:84%
and then putting
advertising next to them.

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Advertising?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yes.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of products?

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I think it's
based on whatever

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the person who had been
searching on the internet

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.957 align:middle line:90%
was looking at previously.

00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a kind of a scary--

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the Google
ads will follow them.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:16.646 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: That's right.

00:10:16.646 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They track what
you're looking at

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll show
ads next to it.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.533 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at beds, chances

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
are beds will pop up on
the obits section, right?

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Right.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.744 align:middle line:84%
So you'd never know what
the ads might be for.

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
But another thing
about obituaries

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that people need to
be aware of these days

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
is identity theft of the dead.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
put too much detail

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
about your date of
birth, date of death,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.484 align:middle line:84%
place of birth,
mother's maiden name.

00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Because those are--
some of those elements that

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:84%
in-- an identity thief can take
and make a whole new identity

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and find out yours
and then-- see,

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.815 align:middle line:84%
the dead can't fight
back on identity theft.

00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:01.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:11:01.315 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they get their
social security number,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:90%
they keep going.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I just had a story on
Coast to Coast last week

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.415 align:middle line:84%
where an individual
has pled guilty,

00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to go to
jail for a little bit,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of stealing his dead
father's identity

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.617 align:middle line:84%
just to keep the social
security check coming in.

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
wasn't a lot of money.

00:11:21.283 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:90%
It was like $8,000.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
But they nailed him for that.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.455 align:middle line:90%
This must be all over the place.

00:11:26.455 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, and
when someone dies,

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
reporting the death to the
social security administration

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.077 align:middle line:84%
is very important
because that way

00:11:36.077 --> 00:11:37.285 align:middle line:90%
they stop sending the checks.

00:11:37.285 --> 00:11:37.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And when social
security was established

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in 1937, the death
benefit for reporting

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.007 align:middle line:84%
a death was $255 because that's
what a funeral cost in 1937.

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:49.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In those days.

00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And nowadays,
that won't even

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
get you an obituary
in the newspaper.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.567 align:middle line:84%
So the price of the death
benefit has not gone up.

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in
the Navy nine years,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
so maybe I'll do
my military thing.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
They bring in honor guards with
you and a flag and all that.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of nice.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: But you could also get
burial in a national cemetery

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
for free with a grave
space and a marker.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
still the funeral cost.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, I
can't believe how high

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the percentage is now of people
who are getting cremated.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.205 align:middle line:84%
It's growing by
leaps and bounds.

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:28.705 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:29.538 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Absolutely.

00:12:29.538 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, 15% of the
population chose cremation.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And in 2015, we're up to 42%
of the population on average.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
That means in Western
states it's over 60%,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
even 70% of the population
choosing cremation.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's cheaper.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's cheaper.

00:12:51.455 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I think that
economically it's

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
the main driver.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But also that we have a
more mobile population.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't have people wanting
to be buried in the family plot

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
because they don't live near
the family plot anymore.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And cremated remains
are portable.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
like the idea

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of scattering the ashes
in a favorite place.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are those
different reasons.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
also good reasons

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to give those remains a
permanent resting place

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:90%
in a cemetery.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Cemeteries are responding
to the rise in cremation

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
by establishing cremation
walls, niche walls or scattering

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%
gardens.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they are?

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.725 align:middle line:90%
Individuals or a grouping?

00:13:34.725 --> 00:13:36.815 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: You could do either.

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Some are even establishing
cremation gardens that

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
are beautiful walls and
shaded patios and places

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
with sculptures and areas where
you could actually bury the urn

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and then put a
rosebush on top of it.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So literally gardens
with all sorts

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
of different options for putting
the remains either in a bench

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.735 align:middle line:90%
or in a wall or other places.

00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and if
you could believe it,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
people actually use jewelry
with some of the remains.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Oh, I see
it all the time

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
when I go to the funeral
director conventions.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
At the expos they have jewelry
where you have a pendant

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can unscrew and
put the remains inside.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Or a bracelet that's
like a hollow tube that

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
would have a hinge and you
could put cremated remains

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:90%
in the ends.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.525 align:middle line:84%
There are glass artisans who
will work cremated remains

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
into glass jewelry or glass
paperweights or glass vases.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Many, many different options.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you cremate a
body, Gail, how widespread

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:90%
are the ashes?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:90%
How much do you get?

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.374 align:middle line:90%
Is it is it that much?

00:14:52.374 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.117 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Probably about
a coffee can's worth.

00:14:55.117 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coffee can.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:90%
There I am.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Right there in that coffee can.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.303 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:14:57.303 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Five to eight pounds of cremated
remains is what you have left.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now do the
teeth burn down?

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, what happens is
the bones become very brittle.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.432 align:middle line:90%
And all of the flesh--

00:15:09.432 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, this is morbid.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Well, it's true life.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But people need
to know about this

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.437 align:middle line:84%
because if they're going
to choose cremation,

00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
they need to know what
they're getting into.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But does everything
burn down to just ash?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Just to bones.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
sweep out the bones

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and put them in what's
called a cremulator.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
It's basically a big blender.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They screen out any
metal parts or fillings.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
question about how much

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
the mercury in your
dental fillings

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
goes into the atmosphere
in the cremation process.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
That could be really
affecting our environment.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're thinking cremation
is more environmentally

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
friendly than, say, taking
up space in a cemetery

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:90%
with whole body burial, oh, no.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Cremation does have
a carbon footprint.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.905 align:middle line:90%
The average size person--

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My, my.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: --being cremated
in a natural gas retort,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is what the machine is
called, generates 532 pounds

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:90%
of CO2, greenhouse gases.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And to put that
in perspective, I

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
have solar panels on my house.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And a system that tells
me how much CO2 I'm

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:84%
offsetting by generating
electricity from the sun.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
In sunny New Mexico
where I live,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I would have to run my
solar panels for 14 days

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:90%
to offset one cremation.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And in northern climates or
places where it's not as sunny,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it would take a month
to offset one cremation.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So it does have a
carbon footprint.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And more than a million people
a year in the United States

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
alone are getting cremated.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it
take to cremate a body?

00:16:56.722 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Depending on the
unit and the size of the body,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.285 align:middle line:84%
it could be anywhere
from two to five hours.

00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
other-- there's

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:84%
a new trend coming on
the scene that people

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.328 align:middle line:84%
will be hearing more about
called alkaline hydrolysis.

00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: That is also
called flameless cremation.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's basically putting the body
into a tank with lye and water

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it up to
temperature and pressure.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And it speeds up the process
of decomposition naturally.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
breaks down the body?

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Breaks down the body.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
like a "Breaking Bad"

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:90%
episode where they dump--

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yes, although--

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the body of that
poor unfortunate kid in a vat.

00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, they did
it with somebody else too.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But that was actually
acid, not alkaline.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: So different--

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it
does the same thing?

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Same thing.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The body is broken down
into the components

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of life, kind of a coffee
colored sterile liquid, which

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
actually makes great fertilizer.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually just
flushed down the drain.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And the bones remain
and become very sandy.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So that becomes the remains
that are given to the family.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And that process actually
gives you more cremated remains

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are so many
cultures different with death?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Some are happy.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Some are sad.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.279 align:middle line:84%
The Irish love the
drink after at a wake.

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
How come they're all different?

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, we're
all different societies.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:10%
I think some societies
have a better understanding

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:10%
and acceptance of death.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We've become a very
death denying society

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And we think medical care
is going to keep us alive

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and stave off the grim
reaper for forever.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But we do have a
100% mortality rate.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the fact
that we're getting away

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:10%
from actually doing funerals
and just trying to make it

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:10%
a celebration is a good
and a bad development.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when we take the
time to acknowledge it,

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:84%
we can incorporate that
change in our lives.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:10%
If we pretend that, oh, we're
just going to have a party

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:10%
and we're not going to cry about
somebody-- losing somebody we

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:10%
love, that is not
moving the process along

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:10%
to bring the
acknowledgment of that loss

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:10%
within our heart and our mind.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I think when you have people
who-- the Irish wake is

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
actually part of the
Catholic tradition of washing

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and dressing the body
and being with the body.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
We have very little chance
to naturally be with the body

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
unless we're doing
our own home funerals.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is a possibility
within the United States

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:90%
in many states.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
There about seven
states that require

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you to have the involvement of a
funeral home when someone dies.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:90%
But you could do it yourself.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't bury
from your relatives

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:90%
in your backyard?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: If you had enough
property and the zoning

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
laws allowed it, you could.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But we've gotten
used to the idea

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of, well, let's just-- the
doctors couldn't fix grandma.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So now she's off to the funeral
home and we don't see grandma

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
either at all or we see
her laid out the casket.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:10%
And when the spirit
leaves the body.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.657 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been
with somebody who--

00:20:57.657 --> 00:20:59.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you do believe
in life after death?

00:20:59.615 --> 00:21:00.836 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: I personally do.

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:01.335 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was with my father-in-law.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Our whole family was
there in the hospital room

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:08.784 align:middle line:90%
with him when--

00:21:08.784 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When he died.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.491 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: --he died.

00:21:10.491 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see
anything strange?

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: It wasn't
visible, but what

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
did change is that when
he was still breathing

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:90%
he looked like my father-in-law.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
After he stopped breathing
and was just laying there,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.411 align:middle line:84%
the body, without the animating
spirit, it was a shell.

00:21:31.411 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And I could definitely
see the difference.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's not
fun dealing with a dying

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:90%
person in the family.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I've had to go
through it twice now.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:90%
One expected, one really not.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: No.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it's important
to plan before there's

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:10%
that unexpected event
or the illnesses

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:10%
really progressing
along with a loved one.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:10%
My motto is talking about
sex won't make you pregnant.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Talking about funerals
won't make you dead.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you can plan ahead, you
can laugh in the face of death.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it that
much easier when

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
the time does come
that you've already

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:90%
at least put plans in place.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
People know what's
expected because death

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
is the great unknown.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
There is this tarot
card of death.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The tarot card of death
does not mean literal death.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It means change and
transition and transformation.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And the unknown.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.947 align:middle line:84%
We're afraid of death because
we're afraid of the unknown.

00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: We don't know
what comes afterwards.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So being prepared at least
with having conversations

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
about what kind of
arrangements you

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
would like to make with
your deceased body really

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
helps the family, the
loved ones, deal with it.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So taking care of
that before you've

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
got a dying person on
your hands really helps.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
interesting, though,

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Gail, is when you're younger,
when you're 10 years old,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
you don't even
think about death.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
When you're 25--

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: You don't.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think about death.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:90%
When you're 40, not a lot.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
All of sudden when you're
in your late 50s or your 60s

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
you're on the home stretch,

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
you begin to think
about it a lot.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But you kind of tuck
it away somewhere.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I know even in my
own life, I know

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:90%
one day it's going to happen.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.720 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know when.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it tomorrow?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Is a 20 years from now?

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:90%
You do need to plan.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of people don't.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:90%
They put it off.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They put it off and
then it's too late.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Exactly.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Then it's too late
to be prepared.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It falls to the bottom
of the to do list.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
go out there and I

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
talk to people about
funeral planning.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I use humor and funny films.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who do you talk to?

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: I go to churches.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I go to community groups.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.777 align:middle line:84%
I talk to Funeral
Directors Associations.

00:24:23.777 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people receptive
when you're talking?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.234 align:middle line:84%
Do they ask
questions about this?

00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Absolutely.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm was a pioneer of
the Death Cafe movement

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Death Cafe?

00:24:33.933 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: This comes to us
from the United Kingdom.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman named
John Underwood,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
based on the work of a Swiss
sociologist named Bernard

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.505 align:middle line:84%
Crettaz, he held these events
called Cafe Mortel where people

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:84%
would come together and
drink coffee and tea

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:90%
and eat cake and cookies.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So the food and drink is
an important comfort aspect

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of talking about
mortality issues.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another
thing for Starbucks

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:90%
to come up with, right?

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Well, yeah.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:90%
You can have them anywhere.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And I've had them in cafes.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I've had them in my own home.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to actually work with
our local funeral homes that

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
have meeting centers,
social halls basically,

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:84%
to hold them there
because that's

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.757 align:middle line:84%
the next step, is
you're going to deal

00:25:21.757 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
with the funeral director.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do?

00:25:23.881 --> 00:25:26.845 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: We sit around and we
talk about mortality issues.

00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:27.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, how nice.

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Well, it's quite
fun in a number of regards.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fun?

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.189 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Fun, yeah.

00:25:33.189 --> 00:25:33.688 align:middle line:90%
We laugh.

00:25:33.688 --> 00:25:33.945 align:middle line:90%
There's laughter.

00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a strange
of humor, don't you?

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: No.

00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's very enlightening to let
those concerns about mortality

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:84%
out and share them
with other people.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no agenda.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But usually the conversation
falls into four categories.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Talking about material
issues, spiritual issues,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
medical issues,
and control issues.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Really Baby Boomers are big
on wanting to control things.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And so we'll talk
about things like physician aid

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.657 align:middle line:84%
in dying, advanced
medical directives, wills,

00:26:10.657 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:90%
all of these other things.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But with the Death
Cafe movement,

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
these are people who are
willing to come out and talk

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
When I go out and
speak to groups,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll usually have
a presentation that

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.909 align:middle line:84%
involves funny film clips
because humor helps break down

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:27.575 align:middle line:90%
that resistance.

00:26:27.575 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are the clips of?

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: From comedies.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
From films like--

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, movies
and things like that?

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Movies.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And TV shows.
"Undertaking Betty."

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you remember
the Chuckles Bites the Dust

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
episode from "The
Mary Tyler Moore Show"

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
where she laughs at
the clown's funeral.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: "Elizabethtown."

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
There are a whole range
of actually comedy films

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that involve scenes
involving funerals.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And I use clips from those.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I have a license to use
film clips in my talks.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.506 align:middle line:90%
And then we can laugh.

00:27:04.506 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The endorphins get into
your system when you laugh.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does anybody cry?

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Not really.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It opens the door to having
the conversation about all

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of these different
details about funeral

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:90%
planning that you need to know.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the party no
one wants to plan.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And it does have hundreds of
decisions that need to be made.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't talked about
it and made those decisions,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
it makes it that
much harder, not

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.490 align:middle line:90%
if but when, it does happen.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See I think
when somebody dies,

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.967 align:middle line:84%
Gail, in their 80s,
it's a good run.

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No need to get upset.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Really no need to cry.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a great run.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Part of living is dying.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a great run.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.055 align:middle line:84%
Somebody guys in their
40s and 50s, that's sad.

00:27:47.055 --> 00:27:49.026 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Mm-hmm.

00:27:49.026 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But we need to have memorial
services and funerals.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:90%
They could be upbeat.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
A good goodbye
incorporates the four R's

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:90%
in any good memorial service.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we recognize
that somebody has died.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Number two, we
remember the person.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
This is where we tell stories.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get
laughter and tears.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Number three, we
reaffirm our beliefs,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:90%
whatever those beliefs might be.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And then number four, we release
the spirit of the deceased.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:84%
We say, you go your
way, we'll go our way.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And that enables the living
to have some sense of closure,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:90%
some sense of processing.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But bear in mind,
grief does not stop.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.926 align:middle line:84%
The grief journey is just
starting with a funeral.

00:28:41.926 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when we
talk about when funerals,

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
what's the preparation
that's involved?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
On the back of my
driver's license,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
for example, there's
a little check.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I could if, God forbid,
I die tragically

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
or in a car accident, it
says, take my body parts

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and use them the
way you want to.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Give somebody my eyes.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Give somebody my kidney.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.066 align:middle line:90%
Your liver.

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Heart.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that happening a lot?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Donating body parts or your body
to university or other places?

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Those are two
different programs.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
When you check your I want
to donate my organs should

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I die in a car accident, they
will take your organs out.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then your family has
to deal with either burial

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.580 align:middle line:90%
or cremation.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:84%
If you donate your body
to a medical program

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
at a university, they
will take the body

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and hold onto it for
perhaps up to two years.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And then cremate the remains
and return them to the family

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:90%
all at no cost to the family.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
However, if they have
enough cadavers when you die

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or if you have certain
medical conditions

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
like infectious diseases
or grossly overweight

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or underweight or
maybe there was

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
too much trauma
to the body, they

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:90%
don't have to accept the body.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you need
to have a plan B

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:84%
for if you do want a free
cremation from donating

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:90%
your body to science.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are national
services that will do that.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
MedCure, Life
Legacy, Science Care

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
are just a couple of these
services that are credentialed.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:10%
You want to make sure they're
credential because there

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:10%
has been some underhanded
dealings in the body donation

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:10%
industry.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.876 align:middle line:84%
So look for a credential
by the American Tissue Bank

00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:42.375 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeez, they have
associations for everything.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yes.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Generally,
what does funeral cost

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.695 align:middle line:90%
compared to a cremation?

00:30:48.695 --> 00:30:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Depending on where you
live a funeral with a burial

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
could be anywhere from
$7,000 to $20,000.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:90%
That high?

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.025 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yes.

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:02.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a lot for
family to have to pay.

00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Exactly.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't thought about
this and realized just how much

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
what the cost is, this
is why we have cremation

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.210 align:middle line:84%
being so much more
growing in popularity

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:90%
because of economic conditions.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:22.261 align:middle line:84%
A direct cremation could be
anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000,

00:31:22.261 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:90%
$3,000.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.006 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's doable
for a lot of people.

00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Right.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a
reason why it's growing?

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:28.135 align:middle line:90%
The cost?

00:31:28.135 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: I believe so.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And our mobility as a society.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.120 align:middle line:84%
That we don't live where
we grew up anymore.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we don't have
any kind of tie to being

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
buried in a particular place.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
Saint Louis area,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
they've indicted
does some people who

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.080 align:middle line:84%
were running an insurance
funeral scam where they

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:84%
collected money for
insurance policies

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:90%
for people who had died.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.915 align:middle line:84%
And they were supposed
to cover the funeral.

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: I remember that.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about that in the book.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what
state you live in--

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These people
were neighbors to me.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Oh, no.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, and since
that time there are

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
a number of-- what you want
to do when you go to pre-plan

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:23.036 align:middle line:84%
is buy a policy that is an
insurance policy that will

00:32:23.036 --> 00:32:24.285 align:middle line:90%
cover the cost of the funeral.

00:32:24.285 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Now there
are differences.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like a little
life insurance policy, right?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Right.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For like $10,000.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.645 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: There's final
expense insurance that

00:32:34.645 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:90%
would pay the family the money.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I that be anywhere
from $3,000 to $30,000.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the policy?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:90%
$20 a month maybe?

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: It depends
how old you are.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a lot.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.929 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:45.929 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: So the older you
are, the more expensive

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The more
expensive it is.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: But if you do a
policy with a funeral home,

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
either you're going to
pre-plan in a state that

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.540 align:middle line:84%
has trusts, a funeral
trust, so the money

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is held by the trust,
not the funeral home.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.875 align:middle line:10%
Because funeral homes get
bought out by corporations.

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they go under.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Or they
go out of business.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:33:10.993 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: So you don't give your
money just to the funeral home

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because it can go
away like that.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And then unfortunately
with that insurance scam,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.585 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately that put
a bad mark on insurance

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:25.671 align:middle line:90%
with funeral planning.

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:26.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure did.

00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBEN: However, there are
a number of major insurance

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:10%
companies now that
funeral homes work

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.370 align:middle line:10%
with so that you buy
an insurance policy,

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:10%
you're keeping that money.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But the beneficiary would
be the funeral home.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.356 align:middle line:90%
Goes straight to them.

00:33:42.356 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And one of the
benefits of planning

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that way is the
funeral home will

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
lock in today's prices for
whatever funeral you arrange.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have space,
Gail, for burying people?

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I've always wondered about that.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Where land, vital land, is
taken up with cemeteries.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: But they're
beautiful, green spaces.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And think about this.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Walmart keeps building
more Walmarts.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're huge parking lots.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.113 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Would you rather see a
Walmart or would you rather see

00:34:15.113 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
a cemetery with nice green
spaces you could go jogging

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.782 align:middle line:90%
in and walk your dog and--

00:34:18.782 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably me, I'd
probably like to see a Walmart.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to live
next to a cemetery.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.270 align:middle line:84%
How far back do you
think burials have gone?

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: In history?

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have data where
the cavemen, Neanderthals--

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.615 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Oh, yes.

00:34:32.615 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they
buried their dead?

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I'm thinking
like 5,000 years.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:84%
And you would have bodies
being buried with items.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
people were thinking,

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:84%
they're going on
a trip and we're

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.650 align:middle line:84%
going to bury them with stuff so
they have their stuff when they

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:54.900 align:middle line:90%
get to wherever they're going.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.441 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look what
the Egyptians did.

00:34:56.441 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: The
Egyptians, the Vikings.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Viking funerals on film
are really Hollywood depictions

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.159 align:middle line:90%
of putting the body on a boat--

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where they
kind of-- and burn it.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And burn it.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.121 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And burning
it on the water.

00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They did put bodies
on boats, but they

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.385 align:middle line:84%
would take the boats out of the
water and burn them on land.

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: Or they would take the
boats out of the water and dig

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
graves, put the boat
with all the stuff--

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In there.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.481 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: --and the
body in the grave.

00:35:25.481 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
actually recovered

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.515 align:middle line:84%
quite a number of artifacts
in Norway and Sweden.

00:35:32.515 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, in
your career what

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is the strangest funeral
you've ever heard about?

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I have attended
a number of funerals.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I did a project called
My 30 Funerals in 30 Days

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.540 align:middle line:84%
where I blogged about funerals
that I just showed up at that I

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:90%
picked out of the obituaries.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.594 align:middle line:90%
I always got--

00:35:52.594 --> 00:35:53.676 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you welcome?

00:35:53.676 --> 00:35:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I asked permission
before I would do that.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Yeah.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: It's kind of strange to
have somebody-- I would show up

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'd like to honor
your loved ones by writing

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.910 align:middle line:90%
about today's funeral.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Would that be OK?

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And everybody said yes.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Usually one out of 30 said no.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But I did go to a
funeral for a biker.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:90%
A biker funeral.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
The Banditos Motorcycle Club
actually paid for the funeral.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So they were out in
force in their colors.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 100 bikes.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: It was 78 bikes.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: And they
did do a road trip.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:34.020 align:middle line:84%
His casket was pulled by a
trike hearse in a glass--

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:90%
the casket in a glass box.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.945 align:middle line:84%
They put stickers on his
casket for the different clubs.

00:36:39.945 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: But it was
a beautiful service.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
They sang "Amazing Grace."

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
They showed pictures of
this guy throughout his life

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.274 align:middle line:84%
as his tattoos multiplied
and his multiple--

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, these
things are for the living.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.647 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Absolutely.

00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.649 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they?

00:36:52.649 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what funerals are for.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.040 align:middle line:90%
For the living people.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:90%
The guy who's dead, he's gone.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: So planning
ahead for your loved ones

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and letting them know
what you would like done

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and even taking the step of
going to the funeral home

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and making your arrangements,
you can put your preferences

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:90%
on file and not pre-pay.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what my husband
and I have done.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
But the information is there.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the other part of the
confusion and the stress.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.360 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
information that needs

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to be pulled together to
be filed for the death

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:90%
certificate.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And where are all
the important papers?

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So being organized
in that regard,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of people
who are not organized

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in their life in general.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's especially
important for end of life

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to at least pull that kind
of information together.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So planning ahead reduces
stress at a time of grief.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.570 align:middle line:84%
It reduces family conflict
because everybody's

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:84%
got their own opinion
about what Mom or Dad would

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:84%
have wanted if Mom or
Dad didn't explicitly

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:90%
say what they wanted.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:10%
It can save you
money because you

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:10%
realize how much
is going to cost

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:10%
and you figure out
a way to cover it.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.102 align:middle line:10%
And then you can talk
about a good goodbye.

00:38:15.102 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's
your website, Gail?

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.926 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBEN: agoodgoodbye.com.

00:38:17.926 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the book
is "A Good Goodbye,"

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:84%
which is a good, good read to
learn about funerals and death

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and dying and cremation.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I think it's important.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:90%
It's part of living.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to escape it.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I wish we could.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day they'll download
our memories onto a chip

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and they'll clone our bodies
and we'll download it back in.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll live
forever that way, huh?

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBEN: I think
we do live forever.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.935 align:middle line:90%
We just don't remember it.

00:38:49.935 --> 00:38:52.933 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We just move on to
another plane or existence.

00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:53.766 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: We move on.

00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBEN: Thank you.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You really don't have anything
to worry about in the death

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and dying process.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.330 align:middle line:90%
But you really do need to plan.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And I hope some of the
messages from Gail Ruben

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.520 align:middle line:84%
today helped you just to
think ahead a little bit.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.280 align:middle line:10%
Because it's going to happen.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
