>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm with astrophysicist
and author Jeffrey Bennett.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And as you know,
Jeffrey writes a number

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:10%
of books, textbooks
for colleges.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
He writes children's
books that have

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
been read on the
International Space Station,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%
highlighting his dog, Max.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And he also, of
course, has written

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:90%
a book about Albert Einstein.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:90%
"What is Relativity?"

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.316 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, of course, being
the genius that he was.

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:54.815 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.023 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY BENNETT: Thank
you very much for having me.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made this
guy a genius, Jeffrey?

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: What makes
a person genius,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that's a tough question.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
what he did was he

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
looked at the world
in a different way

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
than other people
were looking at it.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
He learned the same physics as
other scientists of his time.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
He knew of the same problems as
other scientists of his time.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But he just looked at
it from a perspective

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
that was fresh and different
compared to others.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:10%
And that allowed him
to make discoveries

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:10%
that really had been
waiting just for someone

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:10%
to look at them
in the right way.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would other
people have discovered

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
what he discovered
had he not come along?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.382 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
very interesting.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
Now remember, he
published his theory

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:10%
of relativity in two parts--
the special theory in 1905,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.747 align:middle line:10%
and the general theory in 1915.

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:10%
So we're coming up on
the 100th anniversary.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.954 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
was young, right?

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:53.725 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And he was 26 when
he published his special theory,

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:54.224 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: But
interestingly enough,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
yes, the special theory solved
a number of outstanding problems

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:10%
And there's pretty good evidence
that several other scientists--

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:10%
and one particular,
Poincare-- were

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.392 align:middle line:10%
within months of
publishing the same thing.

00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah, they were close.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: They
were really close.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:90%
He beat them to the punch.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
General relativity,
though-- Einstein,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:84%
with special
relativity, had solved

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
this set of outstanding
problems in physics.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And from everyone
else's perspective,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:90%
well, those problems are solved.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Now let's do
something different.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
bugging Einstein

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
about the special
theory, which was

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.874 align:middle line:90%
that it didn't include gravity.

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it needed
to, even though there

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
was no particular problem
that needed to be solved.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led him to push
ahead with general relativity.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So most historians
of science think

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that if Einstein had not
published general relativity

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in 1915, it might
have been two or three

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.957 align:middle line:84%
decades before anyone
else got to it.

00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
So he was way ahead there.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gravity seems to be
very important in what he does.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Gravity is really
what the theory turns out

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:90%
to be all about in the end.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Special relativity,
where he just

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
deals with motion,
what's missing from it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
is it deals with the
special case of motion that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't include gravity
and that is essentially

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:90%
at constant velocity.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, you can't
move at a constant velocity

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.012 align:middle line:84%
in general unless you
first accelerate to that.

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.719 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: But special
relativity doesn't really

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
tell you what to do with
the accelerating case.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was the part that
really bugged Einstein.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out,
through what he

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
calls the equivalence principle,
that acceleration, he realized,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
was actually
equivalent to gravity.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.714 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little background
I can give you one that.

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: If you think
about Newton's law of gravity

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and Newton's laws of motion.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So Newton has a law that we
call a second law of motion

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And he has a law of
gravity that tells us

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that the force of gravity is
equal to this little equation

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that involves the
masses of the objects.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's also,
for example, a law

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetism
that tells you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
the force of
electromagnetism has

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to do the charges
of these objects.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the charges of objects
have absolutely nothing

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%
to do with their mass.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And by analogy, you
might say, well,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
the gravitational
mass of two objects

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
ought to have nothing to
do with the mass that's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
in Newtons second law of force
equals mass times acceleration.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet it had been known
since Newton's times

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
that those masses are the same.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.594 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
physicists basically

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
said, well, that's an
interesting coincidence.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: However--

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Einstein said,
maybe it's not a coincidence.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the reason
that they appear

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to be the same-- this
gravitational mass

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and this accelerating mass--
is because at a deeper

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
underlying level
in nature, they're

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
actually exactly the same thing.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he discovered.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.869 align:middle line:84%
In the general
theory of relativity,

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
he said they're both
curvature of spacetime.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He did all
this on a chalkboard

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
with all his little figures
and everything else.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
How far would he have gone
had he had a computer?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.165 align:middle line:90%
Had he had what we have today?

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Actually,
I think probably

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.344 align:middle line:84%
in terms of coming
up with the idea,

00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have
helped him a bit.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.426 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Because the
idea-- the creative part--

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's up here.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: That's up here.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.128 align:middle line:84%
What he could have
done with the computer

00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
is made his calculations
go a little faster once he

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
got to the part where
he had to do it.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
reasons it took him

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
10 years from special relativity
until general relativity

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.727 align:middle line:84%
is because the math he was
dealing with became quite hard.

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And there were a few
times where he actually

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:84%
made calculation errors
that threw him off.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which a computer
would have fixed.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: A computer
would have helped

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
him avoid those
calculation errors, yes.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.815 align:middle line:84%
So it would have been
a little quicker, but--

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:49.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we have
learned something new

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
today had he had

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:90%
a computer, in your opinion?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well,
certainly today we

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
study his equations
with computers

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and use them to
model the universe,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to model things
like black holes,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:90%
make predictions, test them out.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we learn a lot
that wasn't possible

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:90%
when we didn't have computers.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we'd had the
computers 100 years earlier,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
we'd be that much further
ahead of the game today.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
talk with you about two

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
things with Einstein-- his
formula of E equals MC square,

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and also time travel.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But with the E equals
MC square, energy

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
equals mass times the
speed of light squared.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:90%
That's enormous.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Is that how we got the atomic
bomb, because of that formula?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the important things
to recognize about that formula

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.447 align:middle line:84%
is that formula comes
straight out of his theory

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
of relativity.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it comes out of special
relativity, the mathematically

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
easier part, which is why
it's a fairly easy equation

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to talk about.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And from that point of
view, people ask me a lot,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
how do we know that
relativity is true?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
How we know that it's real?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons is because E

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
equals MC squared is an
equation of relativity.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And E equals MC squared
explains how the sun shines.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It explains how nuclear
power plants work.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It explains how
nuclear reactions work.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So every time, if you
go outside and you

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
feel the sun on
your arms, that's

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.817 align:middle line:84%
proof that special
relativity is correct.

00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of an amazing thought.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when scientists
took that formula,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how did they know,
let's split uranium?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And why uranium,
Jeffrey, as opposed

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.215 align:middle line:90%
to gold or some other element?

00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, it was
the kind of a complex path.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
At the time that Einstein
published the theory,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
there was actually a
big problem in science

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
with the age of the sun.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
mechanisms that scientists

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
knew of for how the
sun might produce

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
energy were either
chemical or physical--

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:90%
by it shrinking in size.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And those, at best,
allowed the sun

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
to shine for a
few million years.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But the geologists were
already telling you

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth is hundreds of
millions or billions of years

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, there
was something wrong.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The moment he published
E equals MC squared,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
people realized, aha,
if the sun can turn mass

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
into energy, that
could explain how

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:90%
it lives for billions of years.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But no one knew how
that would happen.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
a couple decades

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.827 align:middle line:84%
later that scientists
figured out how--

00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oppenheimer,
those kinds of people.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes,
Eddington, in particular.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
How it could be that
hydrogen fusing into helium

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
could be losing a tiny bit
of mass converted into energy

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and be the mechanism,
the sunshine.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Once they learned
that, then they

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.215 align:middle line:84%
realized that nuclear reactions
could release energy through E

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
equals MC squared.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they began
to-- then they

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
were discovering
radioactivity also.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And uranium, it turned out,
had the magical properties

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
in a sense-- they're not
really magical-- that

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:90%
make the atomic bomb possible.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And the particular thing is
that uranium 235, which is--

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
most of the uranium in the
ground is what we call uranium

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
238, and you cannot
build a bomb from it.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't build a bomb.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.876 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And that's why
you hear about enrichment.

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:18.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can only
build a bomb from uranium 235?

00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So uranium 235 is mixed in
naturally with the uranium 238,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.885 align:middle line:84%
but at the very, very
small percentage.

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you got
to pull that out.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: So you
got a pull that out.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what enrichment is.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear about
the concerns about Iran

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.904 align:middle line:84%
building these enrichment
centrifuges, that's

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing
is they're separating

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
the 235 from the 238.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
the 235 is special

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
is because when it
decays, it actually

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:90%
shoots out three neutrons.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you
have enough uranium 235

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in one place, each of those
three hits another one

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and causes them to each
spit out three more.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then each of those, right,
are spitting out three more.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's a chain reaction.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
nuclear bombs do.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who in the heck
would come up with that?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yet, it
was kind of discovered

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
by accident in the
1930s that the chain

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.204 align:middle line:90%
reaction was possible.

00:10:13.204 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
they discovered it,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
they realized that there
was a potential for a bomb.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
during World War II,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the Manhattan Project
was started primarily

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because the American
scientists were

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.574 align:middle line:84%
afraid that the
German scientists--

00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were going to get--

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Were going
to get it first.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were, they were close.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.053 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, it
actually turns out

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans were
not really that close.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a lot of
interesting history in there.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But the end result
was because we

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
were afraid the Germans were
working on a nuclear bomb,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
we built it first.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
ironically used it on Japan.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.804 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had the
Germans gotten the bomb,

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
though, I think they
would have used it.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.847 align:middle line:84%
They probably would have
used it on London first.

00:10:55.847 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
shut the war down.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.346 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:10:58.346 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:84%
That would have been a
very, very bad thing.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, historically
people debate it.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
My own view is that we did end
the war a lot faster because

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:90%
of using that bomb.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think we also learned
an important lesson.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
When you look at human history--
and we've talked previously

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
about my optimism for the human
species, and one of the things

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
that fuels my optimism
is the atomic bomb

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is the first weapon
that humans have ever

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
built in mass
quantities and then

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.946 align:middle line:90%
not used in mass quantities.

00:11:31.946 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think part
of the reason is

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
because when we saw how much
damage one single one of these

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.807 align:middle line:90%
could do in Japan, it scared us.

00:11:39.807 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared everybody.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Enough to
say, you know what?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:90%
We better not ever use these.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now there
are checks and balances.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.965 align:middle line:90%
The Russians have it.

00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have it.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:90%
We have it.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Israel has it.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:90%
India has it.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.927 align:middle line:90%
Pakistan has it.

00:11:51.927 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, of course,
the more people get it,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
the more easily it is for
those checks and balances

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to fall apart.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And I'm very much
with George Shultz and Sam Nunn

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and William Perry, other
former secretaries of state

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
who were working on
a nuclear-free world.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Eliminate all of
the nuclear weapons

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and make sure no one
ever gets that again.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you'll have that
one country that hides theirs.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, you know,
you can't hide a whole lot

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
because it does
take big facilities

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:90%
to build these things.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And if all of the countries
that have them now-- Russia, US,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
China-- if we all agreed
together that no one can have

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
it, then when somebody goes and
tries to hide it or build one,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
we just all go together
and take it out.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have uranium 235
on the planet, could any of this

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.156 align:middle line:90%
be accomplished?

00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You can make
bombs with other materials--

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.457 align:middle line:84%
plutonium, which we
make from uranium.

00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've made some, right.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: But it would be
much, much more difficult.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, uranium 235's
an unfortunate thing.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did the
Maker give us that?

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
That could have solved
every problem, right?

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.585 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, we would
have been better off

00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:02.515 align:middle line:84%
without that one,
I would say, yes.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With Einstein's
theory of relativity,

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
one has to talk about time
travel and its possibilities.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.085 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:13:10.085 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well,
it's a good question.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Relativity does not
prohibit time travel.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.102 align:middle line:84%
Now, in fact, relativity makes
one-directional time travel--

00:13:21.102 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Very easy,
at least in principle.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Which is that when you
travel at a very high speed

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
relative to Earth, your
time passes slower.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you got into a spaceship
and if we could send you off

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
at fast enough speed to the
center of the galaxy 25,000

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
light years away and
back, 50,000 years

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.094 align:middle line:84%
would pass on Earth
while you were gone.

00:13:45.094 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
going fast enough,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:90%
you might only age a few years.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So you would have time traveled
50,000 years into Earth's

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
future.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.812 align:middle line:84%
Now, time travel
backwards, relativity--

00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's harder.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Does not
give us any way to do.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also doesn't
say it's not possible.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So one of the great
mysteries of physics today

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:09.322 align:middle line:84%
is, is time travel possible,
and if not, why not?

00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
baffling for me.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
talk about going back

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
into time to see
events-- World War II,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, things like
that-- to me is

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
there like a tape recorder
of life, a video recorder

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
capturing all these
events that have occurred.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That when you then
travel back in time,

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
you are rewinding
this video recorder,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:90%
looking at these events.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Or are these events simply gone?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.335 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, the events--
and it's one of the points

00:14:40.335 --> 00:14:42.085 align:middle line:84%
that I make very
strongly in the book, why

00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I think relativity is
so important for people

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand--
events are never gone.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, the events that are
happening right here, right

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:90%
now-- you and I talking.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:84%
This moment is propagating
out into the universe

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:90%
The information.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, realistically,
the ceiling of the building

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and stuff may be
blocking the signal,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.635 align:middle line:84%
but if you ignore that,
then you can imagine someone

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
with-- someone on the
moon-- since the moon is

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
one light second away-- would
see all this happening one

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.921 align:middle line:84%
second after it
actually happens.

00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Someone out at Alpha
Centauri, four light years

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
away, could watch the
show four years from now.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd be
done and home by now.

00:15:19.323 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And a million light
years away, they

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
will be able to watch this
taking place just like it

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.907 align:middle line:84%
is live for us,
but they will not

00:15:27.907 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
see it until a million
years from now.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But this signal is
permanent in the universe.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.869 align:middle line:90%
It is moving out there.

00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:35.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's
all relative, right?

00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: But it's
going out along the way.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Now if there is an
intelligent species that

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
has set up a video
camera somewhere,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
then they could, in
principle, record

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
all of Earth's history, every
event that's ever happened.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they feel like sharing it
with us sometime in the future,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:90%
then we'll get to watch.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.189 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But if the individual on the
planet-- planet Earth-- said,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back and see that
Jeffrey Bennett, George Noory

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:90%
moment, how do they do that?

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well,
that's the trick.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem is, if
that were possible, then

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
you have the Back to the
Future issues, right,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:90%
of changing history.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most scientists
suspect that we will eventually

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.685 align:middle line:84%
discover a law of
nature that prohibits--

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That prohibits it.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.898 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Time travel.

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:10%
Stephen Hawking has
said, "Time travel

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:10%
should be prohibited
in order to make

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.720 align:middle line:10%
the world safe for historians."

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.845 align:middle line:90%
But so far, we don't know--

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:33.344 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know
what he's headed at.

00:16:33.344 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: We don't know what
that law of nature is yet.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So far, we don't know of
anything prohibiting it.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's a good chance we'll
someday find that there is one.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey,
what about worm holes?

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Can you travel
through a wormhole?

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it like a time tunnel?

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's a
really great question.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Now wormholes is
the idea that you

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
might be able to
connect distant points

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
in a shorter way.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Like folding two dots
to a piece of paper.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And the idea
is that the universe

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:90%
is a four-dimensional structure.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.974 align:middle line:84%
We don't see that, but
that's what relativity

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
tells us, is that
there's actually

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:90%
four dimensions to the universe.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy is
that the universe

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
might be like the surface
of a rubber sheet.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you look along the rubber
sheet and here's two points

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
and they're a long
way from each other.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But what if the
rubber sheet folds?

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
They're still a long
away from each other.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.794 align:middle line:84%
But what if you then dug
a tunnel between them?

00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Then they're close.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the wormhole.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly enough,
mathematically, wormholes

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.367 align:middle line:84%
must exist, according
to Einstein's theory

00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:90%
of relativity.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
convinced they do?

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: The problem
we have-- We're not

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
convinced because they're
a mathematical structure

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and in science
we're not convinced

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:90%
until we have physical evidence.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
physical evidence.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The problem
mathematically also is

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that even though
mathematically they

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
exist in Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
it also shows that the
moment you try to enter one,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.611 align:middle line:90%
it collapses.

00:17:58.611 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah ha.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: So
there's no known way

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that you could use
them for travel.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
However, if you
could-- and there

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
might be things we'll discover
in the future-- Kip Thorne,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:84%
a relativity physicists
from Caltech,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
worked with Carl Sagan when
Carl wrote his novel, "Contact,"

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.989 align:middle line:84%
and in the movie, imagined this
network of wormholes connecting

00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:90%
things throughout the universe.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
how they traveled.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's
how they traveled.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And they found a way
to keep them stable.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing,
again, right now

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:84%
in our laws of physics
that say you can't do that.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.212 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is possible,
which would be really cool.

00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
other dimensions

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.435 align:middle line:90%
out there in the universe?

00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, we know
there are the four dimensions

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime that
make up our universe.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.294 align:middle line:84%
Whether there's others
is not known yet.

00:18:46.294 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know that.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Now in
some of the ideas

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that try to reconcile
quantum mechanics

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and relativity together--
which none of these ideas

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
have been tested yet-- but
some of those ideas require,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
on a microscopic scale,
things be wrapped up

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
to 10 dimensions
or 26 dimensions

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
or these other wild ideas.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So other dimensions
almost certainly exist.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Whether they have any
bearing on us in our universe

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.835 align:middle line:90%
is the scientific question.

00:19:14.835 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
wrote the book, "What

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
is Relativity?" what fascinated
you the most, Jeffrey?

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well,
I think relativity

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.615 align:middle line:90%
is amazing in many, many ways.

00:19:23.615 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wrote the book
is because we're coming up here

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
on the 100th
anniversary next year

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
of Einstein's general
theory of relativity.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the theory that is at
the heart of all modern physics

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and astronomy.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.226 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do anything
in the science of physics

00:19:38.226 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and astronomy
without relativity.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is it.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the holy grail.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.456 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: This is it.

00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It also explains
why your GPS works.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%
It also explains why our show
is going out there into space

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and is a permanent
record in the universe.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's all
really important for people

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand, even if
you're not a physicist.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone should have at least
some basic understanding

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:90%
of this theory.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most people
know nothing about it.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
wrote the book for,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:84%
to try to give people who are
not physicists, who've never

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
studied this before, a little
short introduction to what

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
these amazing ideas are
that Einstein came up with.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And why they matter to you.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was Einstein doing
when he wasn't a physicist?

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Did he have hobbies?

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.045 align:middle line:90%
What did he like to do?

00:20:22.045 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Einstein had
quite an amazing life.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And another one of
the things that I

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
think makes relativity
important is the way

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
it reveals the human potential.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is really shown
by Einstein himself.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was working
at a time-- as a Jewish man

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
at a time when there was a
great deal of anti-Semitism,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.429 align:middle line:84%
even back at the
turn the century

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that he had to deal with.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he had to leave Germany
when the Nazis were coming

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
to power and came to the United
States and continued his work--

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lucky us.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: In the United States.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:59.355 align:middle line:84%
And he managed, despite all
the hardships around the world,

00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to always see the positive.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
He was a forceful
advocate for peace.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a forceful advocate
for women's rights

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:90%
and for global human rights.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he have children?

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.325 align:middle line:90%
Was he married?

00:21:10.325 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: He did.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
His personal life
had some issues.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.454 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:21:14.454 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't go into
those in this book.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Walter Isaacson wrote a
wonderful biography of Einstein

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
where he goes into those kinds
of things in much more detail.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
As we often find with
some of our famous people,

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.359 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they embody
these great ideals,

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but have difficulty living
up to them personally.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, that's true.

00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That
doesn't change the fact

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that they've embodied
these great ideals that

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:90%
can inspire the rest of us.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:10%
But Einstein really
showed how you

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:10%
could take the human potential,
just with our creative power,

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:10%
and discover amazing things,
despite the problems going on

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:10%
in the world, and then use
the platform that he got--

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:10%
he became famous
because of his science--

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:10%
and then he used that
to promote world peace,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:10%
to promote human
rights and so on.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's a
great example of what

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.565 align:middle line:10%
we do when we're at our best.

00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think he
felt when he saw that formula,

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
E equals MC squared, used
to make the atomic bomb?

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, of course,
he actually wrote a letter

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to President
Roosevelt suggesting

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.059 align:middle line:84%
that we should go ahead
with the Manhattan Project.

00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:21.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Because
he was worried

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the Germans would get
it first and because he

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
knew that if they got
it, they would use it.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, after
it was used in Japan,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
he then started an organization
of scientists dedicated

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to eliminating nuclear
weapons from the world.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, at the time,
he did not succeed.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But today that work
is being carried

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
on by this bipartisan group
of former secretaries of state

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
led by-- Henry Kissinger is the
leader of this group working

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:90%
for a nuclear-free world.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be nice.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It would be nice.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the same
time, did this theory

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
cause the origination of nuclear
power and things like that?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nuclear power
also comes from that, yes.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you're working for--
when I say nuclear free,

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.887 align:middle line:90%
I mean nuclear bomb-free.

00:23:11.887 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Free.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Not
nuclear power-free.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear power is
probably something

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:90%
that we really want to work on.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of debate
about nuclear power,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
but in my mind,
the biggest problem

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we face as a civilization
is global warming.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And nuclear power doesn't
emit any greenhouse gases.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.799 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, nuclear power
is a very important part

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of the solution to the problem.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, you saw what
happened at Fukushima in Japan.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Did you think twice then
about supporting that?

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I think
that, when you

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
see that, you realize we have to
be very, very careful about it.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
But to some extent--
and Carl Sagan

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
actually was an advocate of
this and expressed it very well.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
the idea that even

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:84%
if we have a Fukushima or a
few Fukushimas, that's horrible

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and we should do everything
possible to avoid it.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But it causes damage
to a localized region,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
where as global
warming is threatening

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the entire planet and
all of human existence.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So given that trade
off, we're still

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
probably better off
with nuclear power.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is actually
technology today

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that would make
Fukushimas impossible.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.251 align:middle line:84%
We have fail-safe
nuclear technologies

00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:90%
that we could implement.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.041 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they
should have done there.

00:24:29.041 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Which they
should have done there.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, when we
do build nuclear power plants

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:84%
in the future,
will we build them

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
the right way or the wrong way?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had an
audience with Albert Einstein,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.886 align:middle line:90%
what would you ask him?

00:24:41.886 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Oh, wow.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I've never really
thought about that one.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd really want to know, given
the way the world has evolved

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.939 align:middle line:84%
since he died in 1955, what
would he tell us to do now?

00:24:54.939 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I think he'd
have good ideas.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
he'd think of the world today?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I think he
would see it largely

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
in a very positive light.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, he lived through
World War II and the Holocaust

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and all these really
horrible things.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of bad stuff
going on in the world today.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:90%
But compared to World War II--

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was pretty bad.

00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yeah this
stuff's minor in comparison

00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:90%
to a Hitler.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless we
build up to that again.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And yeah, but I
think we're doing better.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
People complain about
the United Nations,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:90%
but it does a lot of good stuff.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we're better
than we used to be.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What year did
he die, do you remember?

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.344 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: He died in 1955.

00:25:39.344 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '55.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So he was 14 years short of
seeing us land on the moon.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:84%
That would have been
exciting for him.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It would have
been exciting for him.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'll also tell
you, shortly before he

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
died, he gave one of
my favorite quotations

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
from him, which is, when asked
about the meaning of death,

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
he said, "Death
signifies nothing.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The distinction between
past, present and future

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
is only a stubbornly
persistent illusion."

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I think he knows that in
the permanence of spacetime--

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that idea that this
moment exists somewhere--

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lives forever--

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: The
universe-- everyone

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.394 align:middle line:84%
makes a permanent
mark in spacetime.

00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the things
that Einstein was telling us

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
with that quote
and with his theory

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is that nothing's
ever over, right?

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Every action you take
is recorded permanently

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.742 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:26:33.742 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
everybody understood

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.616 align:middle line:84%
that-- and it's
one of the reasons

00:26:36.616 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book-- is
if everyone understood

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that everything they
do is permanent,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe we'd all
behave a little bit

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
better because we'd want to
make sure that those permanently

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
recorded actions
didn't reflect badly.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he a
believer in God?

00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Einstein
believed in God, but not

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.366 align:middle line:84%
in a traditional
religious sense.

00:26:58.366 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A higher power?

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.245 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: A higher
power, yes, yes.

00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:04.134 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which, you
know, he may be right.

00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He may have been right.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a higher
intelligence out there,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I think, driving
things in the universe.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.645 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder how he would have
handled the multiverse theory.

00:27:15.645 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's
a good question.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I think he would not
like the multiverse,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I could say fairly confidently.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the multiverse
comes out of some

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of the very same ideas
in quantum mechanics

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:90%
that bugged him so much.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, he famously
in an argument

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
with Niels Bohr about
quantum mechanics--

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A physicist
at the time.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Which involves-- quantum
mechanics introduces

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of probability into
events in the universe.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein's objection to it
that he phrased simply to Bohr

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
was, "God does not play dice."

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And Bohr's response
to Einstein was,

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.476 align:middle line:90%
"Stop telling God what to do."

00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they
were both right.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.049 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Perhaps, yes.

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they
were both right.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever get
another Einstein?

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.525 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I think we
have other Einstein's.

00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But Einstein made a truly
revolutionary discovery,

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so he comes in line
with Newton, who

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:84%
made truly revolutionary
discoveries.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's others who made very
revolutionary discoveries that

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:90%
are not quite as famous.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:10%
We're, in some
sense, still waiting

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:10%
for a discovery as
big as relativity.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:10%
It's been 100 years.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.962 align:middle line:10%
And while we've made many
incredible discoveries

00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:10%
since then, I'm not
sure that any of them

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:10%
have altered our perception
of spacetime and the universe

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to the extent that
relativity did.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would be
great to have seen him

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.464 align:middle line:84%
at CERN watching the
particle collider.

00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:36.255 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Correct.

00:28:36.255 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have been something.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: He would
have loved that.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Thank you so much.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love things in space,
and astrophysicist Jeffrey

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Bennett brings it home, does he?

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:10%
With his books for children,
with his books for college,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:10%
and of course, his latest,
"What is Relativity?"

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:10%
all About Albert Einstein.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
