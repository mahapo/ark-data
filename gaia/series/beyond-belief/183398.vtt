00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
intuition on the program

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
today with Dr. Jeffrey
Mishlove, PhD, doctor.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
He's the only doctoral
diploma expert

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
with a degree in
parapsychology ever awarded

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
by an accredited
university, and that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
was the University of California
Berkeley back in 1980.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And he is a noted author
of several classic books,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:90%
including "The PK Man."

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.435 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY MISHLOVE: It's
a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are a giant in
this field, did you know that?

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: No.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, your
reputation precedes yourself.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I'm delighted
to hear that, thank you.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The PK Man".

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll always remember that one.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:10%
That was your first major book.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:10%
And it just captured the
attention of everybody.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:90%
What made you write that?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I'd
done 10 years of research

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
with this fellow, Ted Owens,
who proclaimed himself,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
loudly in fact, to be the
world's greatest psychic.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
met him in London,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
he walked on the stage
carrying a toy wagon.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Big man with a beard and a
booming voice and a toy wagon

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
stacked high with
papers, and he said

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
these papers prove that
everything he says is true.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And as a researcher--

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I was a graduate
student at the time.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I thought, my goodness, if
what he's saying is correct,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:10%
somebody ought to look into it.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:10%
And I soon discovered that
my friends Hal Puthoff

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:10%
and Russell Targ at
SRI at International

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:10%
had been besieged by him.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They had a similar
stack of papers.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted nothing
more than to get rid of it

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
because they were doing work for
the CIA, and they felt that--

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
other things to do.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: A character
like Ted Owens

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
was going to be too much
of a loose cannon for them.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So they were happy to get
rid of all this material

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and give it all to me.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And that started by
research with them.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It lasted for 10 years.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It was unbelievable
because, in spite

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that the man you'd
have to say was a braggart,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, but what he
was claiming bore out

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I had, on my files,
over 160 examples

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of demonstrations of psychic
powers that he had produced.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would say roughly
2/3 of them worked out just

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:90%
as he said they would.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So after you got
done of 10 years worth of work

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
with this guy,
what did you think?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I thought that
his claims were unbelievable.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't accept them,
but I couldn't deny them

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
He said he was in
telepathic contact

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
with aliens, invisible aliens
in a giant spaceship hovering

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
over the earth that
was also invisible.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It made no logical,
rational sense.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you looked at
his batting average,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:90%
he was better than Babe Ruth.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1987.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that was early.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I did the research
between '76 and '87.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The first draft of the
book was completed by 1979.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And when me and my
co-author, D. Scott Rogo,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
well-known parapsychologist,
showed it to publishers,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't believe
that it was non-fiction.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
They assumed it was a
very poorly written novel.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And so it sat
in my basement for 20 years

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
before it was published
as a book in 1999.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey,
did Ted ever explain

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
how he got these abilities?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He
claimed that he had

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
been watched by
these alien beings

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
since he was a child, that
they made sure that he engaged

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
in many different professions.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
He was a bullwhip artist at the
circus, a high-speed typist.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
He worked in the parapsychology
laboratory of JB Rhine

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.155 align:middle line:90%
at Duke University.

00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't get
much better than that.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He was
a jazz drummer.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:90%
He did all of these things.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said they guided
him so that his mind would

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
be capable of manipulating their
very complex symbol system,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and they could
interact with him.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
He also said that they had been
waiting for over 1,000 years

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to find somebody with as strong
a nervous system as his so

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that they could
channel whatever they

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%
were channeling through him.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
He maintained he
was the first person

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
they had found since Moses
who could do these things.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
moment, the epiphany for you

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:90%
where you believed this?

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.345 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It
was very dramatic.

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were several
very dramatic ones.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, he was
going to produce a UFO for me.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.442 align:middle line:84%
I saw on the files that he had
produced UFOs for witnesses.

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He would
summon them down.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, so
he said, yes, I'll

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:10%
make a UFO appear within
a 50-mile radius of San

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:10%
Francisco.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he said
I'll make three appear.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Then one happened.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he got on the
phone with me, and he said,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Jeffrey, I can feel it coming.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be big.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be seen
by hundreds of people.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, it will
be photographed,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and the photograph
will be published

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in the front page of one
of your local newspapers

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
in the San Francisco area.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, just a few days later,
that's exactly what happened.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: That
got my attention.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.902 align:middle line:90%
That would get your attention.

00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Not only
was it photographed,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:90%
it was videotaped.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The videotape was published
on KQED evening news,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Channel 9 in San Francisco.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
one of the forefront

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
experts in the subject matter
we're talking about tonight,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and that is intuition.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us, first of
all, what your gut tells you

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:90%
about intuition?

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Intuition
is the natural ability

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of the human mind to directly
perceive reality around us.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Taught by what?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:90%
How do we get this ability?

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: We're born with it.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
This is how children learn
language, for example.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't go to school
to learn how to speak.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: They pick it
up, and it's very natural.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But as we get older, especially
as we become more schooled,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
we develop our
other capabilities.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:10%
Our logical mind takes
precedence over intuition,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:10%
often, to our own detriment.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some
people better at intuition

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
than others?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, sometimes it's
just sort of beaten out of you.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're a young
boy-- you probably

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:90%
remember this yourself.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.062 align:middle line:90%
Big boys don't cry.

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not supposed to.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't be in touch with
your inner feelings.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think I get more
emotional the older I get,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, sure.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It's because we allow ourselves
to get in touch a little more

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
with the inner child,
which, you could say,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:90%
that's the intuitive part.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, though,

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
do not act on their intuition,
and something happens to them,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and they go, oh, I knew it.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Doesn't
that happen often?

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time, yeah.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Our culture is heavily
out of balance.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
We emphasize the sensational.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:90%
We emphasize the intellect.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:90%
We emphasize emotions.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But intuition is
the least emphasized

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
of our human talents.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in parapsychology

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and a degree in parapsychology?

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I was
originally studying criminology

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
at Berkeley.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I was working in
San Quentin prison

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
conducting group therapy with
murderers and sex offenders.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I made a decision
that I wanted

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
to study the positive aspects
of human deviance, not

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
the negative.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It was impossible to
do that at Berkeley.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
You could study
psychopathology and crime

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:90%
in many different departments.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But you couldn't
study creativity,

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
psychic functioning,
mysticism, intuition.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And I agonized over
this for months and months.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Then, one day I
knew the answer was

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:90%
going to come to me in a dream.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It came to me in a
dream that night.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I woke from the
dream exhilarated,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:90%
but I had no idea why because--

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great
poet Robert Frost once

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
wrote a poem called
"The Road Not Taken."

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you took this road?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Oh, I am so glad.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, is
the lesson I learned.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
The dream provided the answer
for me, but I had to push.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to act out the dream to
discover what the answer was.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it led me to where
I am with you right now,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:90%
in effect, into media work.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed me to create
a unique doctoral degree

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.575 align:middle line:90%
program at Berkeley.

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And I am glad
for it every day of my life.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And well, we are too,
by the way, Jeffrey.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:90%
We are too.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, right, you've
got a channel

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
called "New Thinking Aloud."

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It's
a YouTube channel.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And I interview mostly
other professionals

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
working in parapsychology.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there are no programs
in parapsychology in the United

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:90%
There are several in Europe.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think someday
there will be.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And this will be a
resource for people

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
who really want to get in to the
depths of what serious scholars

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.112 align:middle line:90%
have to say about this field.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On this
channel, you interviewed

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Joe McMoneagle, one of the
experts of remote viewing.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Define, for our
viewers who may not know,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:90%
what remote viewing actually is.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSEPH MCMONEAGLE: Remote
viewing is the ability,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
under protocol, the ability
to describe a person, place,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:84%
event, anything it's
remote from you,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that you have
absolutely no access to,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and no one's told
you anything about.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: The
protocol aside, it's

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what
parapsychologists and others

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.283 align:middle line:84%
have called clairvoyance
for the last hundred years.

00:10:30.283 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCMONEAGLE: Yes,
it probably is closer

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to clairvoyance because we don't
know how the information gets

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:90%
to the psychic.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We do know that it can be
noise, tastes, smells, visions.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything
all mixed together.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You can have, uh anesthesia
taking place, so almost

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It's a controversial
field because, on the one hand,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
you participated in a
government-sponsored program

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
that ran for 20 years.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, there
are many, many people out there

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
in the world today who A,
either have no knowledge or B,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:84%
have a great deal of
misinformation about it,

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or C believe that
it's impossible

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and could never have
occurred in the first place.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCMONEAGLE: That's
correct, all three groups.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which
one's the largest.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe is, of course,
one of the foremost experts

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewing, part of
the government's program too,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:90%
wasn't he?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Indeed, he was.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he's referred to
as remote viewer number one,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
not that he was necessarily the
first, but perhaps the best.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he worked with Ingo
Swann, and Russell Targ, Hal

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Puthoff, all of them.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.465 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: That's correct.

00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he's actively
involved in the Psychological

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:84%
He's a rare person who is
gifted with, what I would call,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
psychic talent or
remote viewing.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But he works closely
with researchers,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and he has the whole time.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
remote viewing, Jeffrey,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
different than intuition, or
is it all one in the same?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I would say this.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is one
kind of intuition,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:84%
but intuition is
a large umbrella.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.167 align:middle line:84%
And it includes all kinds
of psychic functioning,

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but even things that
you wouldn't even

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
consider psychic, like if
you go to see a doctor,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and the doctor can diagnose you.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's based on a
lifetime of experience,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's also based
on inner knowing.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
pick between remote viewing

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.973 align:middle line:84%
or intuition, one gift,
what would that be?

00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Intuition.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intuition.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I would
choose intuition

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because remote viewing
is very specialized.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You can work for the
government, perhaps,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
as people once did to find
out what other countries are

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
doing or thinking.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing has many
practical applications.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But most people want to
know, how should they

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:90%
live their lives?

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: How do
they best become--

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
how can people become the
best version of themselves?

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where intuition
and only intuition

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:90%
can provide the answer.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
downside to being intuitive?

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Actually, the only
downside that I can think of

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is if you let it
go to your head.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If you become egotistical about
it, as, frankly, as Ted Owens

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
just going to say,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
it sounded like he
was one of them.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well,
it's a great trap

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
because people admire everyone
who has psychic abilities.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And people get very
excited by that.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to impress people
if you have psychic abilities,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's a trap.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But haven't people
looked at Jeffrey, those people

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
with psychic abilities,
to be a little off

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and whacked out over the years?

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, indeed.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's because, as far as our
culture at large is concerned,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
these abilities
are not accepted.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why is it that I'm the
only person in the world who

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
has a doctoral diploma
that says parapsychology?

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I got that had in 1980,
nearly 40 years ago.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
You would think they would
be pumping out students

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:90%
like crazy at universities.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: How
many people have you

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
interviewed who work in this
area and are fascinated by it.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But the guardians of our
culture, the universities

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
don't want to deal with it.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and speaking of
universities, Duke University,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
at one point, had the
Rhine Institute there

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
where they studied
under JB Rhine.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:10%
It was an amazing format
to be able to investigate

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:10%
parapsychology.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
When he died, the
program died there.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But isn't there still
a JB Rhine Institute

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.232 align:middle line:90%
that his family has kept going?

00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: There is, indeed.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:90%
And he, actually, he retired.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I think it was about 1964.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And he took the parapsychology
laboratory, at that point,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:90%
off campus.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:90%
He had independent funding.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So he, himself, kept
the laboratory going

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and the foundation going.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And now the Rhine
Institute is still

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
active in Durham,
North Carolina.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter,
Sally Rhine Feather

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.182 align:middle line:90%
is the head of the Institute.

00:15:13.182 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they do there now?

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: They do
parapsychology research.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They have programs
for the public.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They also offer distant
learning programs as well.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
They're one of the most
active parapsychology centers

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know Uri
Geller quite well.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love the guy.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:90%
He's amazing.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And he, of course,
for people who

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
don't know who he is,
was the spoon bender,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
still is, where he
uses his psychic powers

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
to do these incredible things.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
He's been on "Coast to
Coast" with me before.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about the day
Johnny Carson invited him on.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But he felt like he was kind of
set up with the whole saying.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Johnny was a amateur
magician, and he

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
wanted to prove to the world
that Uri was faking it.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And Uri was unable to bend
spoons on the Johnny Carson

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Show because he was so
flabbergasted and frustrated

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:90%
by that.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it was
the end of his career.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it
sparked his career

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:84%
because he then got calls
from "The Mike Douglas Show"

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that
afterwards, and his career just

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.847 align:middle line:90%
took off like a rocket.

00:16:28.847 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is, Jeffrey,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
he was on "Coast to Coast"
with me, on my radio show.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And he asked people to get
their dead watches and clocks

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and hold them by the radio.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going to
make them start for people.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I was getting emails by
the hundreds from people

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
who were saying, my watch
that hasn't run in 10 years

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
is now ticking.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:90%
It was bizarre.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Years ahead, we replayed the
program on one of our weekend

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
shows where we have a segment
where we have the best of.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I completely
didn't even notice

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
that we had his show running.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a taped programming
in a different slot

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not live at.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting emails from
people saying, my clock is

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:90%
working, my watch is working.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, what
the heck is this?

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:90%
I realized we replayed it again.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And even on tape it works.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It
suggests to me, George,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that time is not what
we normally think it is.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
People wonder, how do you
explain these strange things?

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think we assume that time
and space are what they naively

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
appear to us to be.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty clear to me that
time, space, and consciousness

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
are very different.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the best way to put it
is that time and space exist

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
within consciousness
rather than consciousness

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:90%
exists within time and space.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet, some people
cannot manifest their psychic

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Do they put up a block?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well,
it's a deep question.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.893 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't everybody
psychic all the time?

00:18:08.893 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You would think it was an
innate ability that we have.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I think the
research shows, to the extent

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is
research in this area,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's not a
well-funded field,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
but the research shows
that young children can

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:90%
be quite gifted.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But as they grow older,
they lose that ability.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because, frankly,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
when you're a young child,
and you're growing up,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very important to you
to get along with your peers,

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to make your
bed and tie your shoes

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and interact here in
the physical world,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:90%
to develop an ego.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And as the young child
develops that ego,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
they get less and less in touch
with their own inner being

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and more and more in touch
with the outer world.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a normal part, I
think, of human development.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people never go back
and reawaken that inner child

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
with all of those intuitive
gifts that the inner child has.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in many cases, the
inner child suffers from abuse.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I can be
a very harsh world.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
encourage a young child

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
who has some of these
abilities to enhance them?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, and I hope
that other people will as well.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very important.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, when a young
child shows these abilities,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:90%
it frightens the parents.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a little
bit about these abilities

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
as they directly relate to
mental health, for example.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people have always
claimed that, if you

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
have psychic abilities,
you're mentally ill.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, in fact,
if you look at the Diagnostic

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and Statistical Manual for
the American Psychiatric

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Association, claiming to
have psychic abilities

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
is one of the symptoms that
could accompany psychosis.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people
have mental illness,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and they believe
themselves to be psychic.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Other times, however,
people really are psychic,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and they get misdiagnosed
as being mentally ill.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We have severe cultural
problems around this.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you looked at
the possibility of possession

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and that spirit worlds might
be helping us out a little bit?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I feel
like my life has been

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:90%
helped by invisible forces.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would say this
to your viewers.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
If you resolve to become the
best version of yourself,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the universe will
reach out and help you.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And the universe is very big.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%
It contains--

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Let's say it
contains spiritual forces.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is Dr.
Terrence Palmer?

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Terry
Palmer, yes, indeed,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
he is a specialist in what he
calls spirit release therapy.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
If people do become possessed,
as you referred to earlier,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:90%
he has therapeutic methods--

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:90%
gentle, not an exorcism at all--

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --to help guide that
spirit toward its own evolution

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.432 align:middle line:90%
and away from possessing you.

00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was on your show.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, indeed.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
We have, in previous
interviews, talked about some

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
of the dangers associated
with possession, that there

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
are cases in the records from
almost every culture of people

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
who get possessed
in a negative way

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
or come under some negative
psychic influence, maybe not

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
a full possession,
but an obsession

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
or a harmful influence, perhaps,
a harmful telepathic influence.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
These phenomenon have been
studied and researched

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
at the Society for Psychical
Research for nearly 150 years

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TERRENCE PALMER: Yes.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The problem with, I suppose
the word possession,

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
is that it conjures up in
people's minds, generally,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
things that we would perhaps
see in entertainment like films

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
like "The Exorcist,"
and "Rosemary's Baby,"

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But in the real world
of everyday life,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
each and every one of us
is vulnerable to some kind

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual influence,
good and bad.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And the way I've learned,
from experience to view this,

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is in much the same
way that we physically

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
have an immune system
that helps to protect us

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:90%
from invasion from diseases.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, we have a
spiritual immune system

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:10%
in the form of an
etheric body and an aura.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
An I like, because
of the work I do,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I like to view this aura as
an armor, as a protection,

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.975 align:middle line:90%
against infection.

00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think,
Jeffrey, it's amazing

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have somebody
with his caliber

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:90%
investigating these things.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It is indeed.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And he's published
a fascinating book

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:10%
called "The Science
of Spirit Possession"

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:10%
where he really looks
at it in great detail.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
He got a doctoral degree
in England for doing that.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
hear these words,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.405 align:middle line:84%
psychic attacks, possessions,
what do they think?

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well,
many people are

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.108 align:middle line:84%
suspicious that this
is happening to them,

00:23:31.108 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're frightened,
and they want

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to know, what can they
do to protect themselves?

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.928 align:middle line:84%
Other people I think
it's all superstition.

00:23:37.928 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or mentally ill.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Or
mental illness, yes.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
confusion around it

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have a coherent
social cultural understanding

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We have half the
population thinking

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
it's the work of the devil
and the other half thinking

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't exist at all.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
psychiatry say about this?

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well,
psychiatry now says

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that, if a person is
experiencing psychic phenomena,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
but they aren't troubled
in any other way,

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:90%
it's not a symptom of psychosis.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be a very
healthy thing.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, if you
look at the research

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:10%
around the most accomplished,
most successful people

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:10%
in our culture, you'll find
that, typically, they do report

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:10%
having had mystical and
psychic experiences that

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:10%
were crucial to their
own development.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use these
abilities almost everyday

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:90%
for yourself?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I would say this.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself a person
who is very open, that I've

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
had many, many
abilities like that,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
but I don't profess to use them.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't claim to be a psychic.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a person who enjoys
a lot of psychic experiences

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:90%
when they occur.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
control when they occur,

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:90%
but they seem to occur often.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say a
hunch is part of intuition?

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, I
would, or a gut feeling,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
or a still, small voice.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
that intuitions come.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage people to listen
to their body, for example.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
What does your body
have to say to you?

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dannion Brinkley, of
course, has died several times.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:90%
He's up to four times now.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he just had
another near-death experience.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
He keeps telling me they
keep sending him back.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't want him.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So he may live until
he's 400, who knows?

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But how does this
near-death experience

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:90%
tie into some of these things?

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: People who have
had the near-death experience

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
almost universally come
away profoundly transformed

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
by the experience and certain
to the depths of their bones

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that death is not the
end of consciousness,

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
that the consciousness
will survive death.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
They say they know for sure
because they've been there.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to pay
very careful attention to what

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:90%
these people are saying.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Their experiences are
very profound and very

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
much akin to what mystics have
reported throughout the ages.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Science is now
beginning to say that,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
when you die, your
consciousness still exists,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and that many people
in their dying state--

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:90%
of course we don't know.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We've not been there, and
we're in no rush to get there.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But that they know
they can't move,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
but their consciousness
is still functioning.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
They haven't moved on yet.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They know they're
dead in a body.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of scary, Jeffrey.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Trapped in your body,
and you know you're dead.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, it could be
very scary for some people.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to
look into the literature

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
going to die someday.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Our physical body will die.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would be very helpful
for people to prepare for it.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle
Ages, they had what

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
they called the art
of dying, and I think

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%
we've lost that to some degree.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
There are some boo-- the
"Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
the "Egyptian Book
of the Dead," which

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
are training guides,
trying to teach

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:84%
people of that era what
was going to happen to you

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.762 align:middle line:90%
when you died.

00:27:15.762 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Mm-hmm,
and I think we

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
can learn a lot from the
experiences of people who have

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:90%
had this near-death encounter.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of research now
with mediums and communications

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
There's an enormous body of
research now on reincarnation.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
it's incumbent upon all of us

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.577 align:middle line:84%
to be familiar
with these fields.

00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander who had
a near-death experience

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:84%
has been on "Beyond
Belief" a couple times

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.888 align:middle line:90%
with his amazing story.

00:27:50.888 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: It
changes you to realize

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:90%
you're a spiritual being.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not just birth to
death in one incarnation,

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:90%
but you have many incarnations.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self is one
connected to all other beings

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to that divine force at
the core of the universe

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that, indeed, NDE-ers
have been talking

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:90%
about for thousands of years.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
That is part of each
and every one of us.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Our very conscious awareness
has a direct relationship

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.950 align:middle line:84%
with that calls of
force in the universe.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it binds us all together
through love and compassion

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and kindness, which
are the oldest

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
lessons from our
profits and mystics

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:90%
and our religious systems.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
When you get behind the
modern orthodoxies and all,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
it's really all based in that
togetherness and that oneness.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And modern consciousness
studies are

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
proving that, from a
scientific viewpoint,

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
this is the way the
universe actually works.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
a Dr. Alexander, Jeffrey?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He's become a
controversial figure because

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that
he's so prominent.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The skeptics have pounced on
him and tried to denounce him.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brutalized him.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.027 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: They have.

00:28:57.027 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I'm
concerned, his testimony

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is quite consistent with
the testimony of dozens

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
if not hundreds and
hundreds of other people

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:84%
who have had
similar experiences.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.758 align:middle line:84%
So I have no reason to doubt his
sincerity and his authenticity.

00:29:12.758 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a medical doctor.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Why would he make this up?

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, skeptics
have their reasons.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
to go into them,

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I think they're so trivial.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A skeptic
one day we'll find out

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that the other side does
exist, and that all this is

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.495 align:middle line:90%
the real deal.

00:29:29.495 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Presumably,
although, there

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
are those who say that, if you
believe that there's nothing

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:84%
to experience after
you're dead, that's

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
what your experience
will be, that we

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
enter into a realm of
our own consciousness.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So for all I know, not
everybody gets reincarnated.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody has an afterlife.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people
would prefer not to.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people would
prefer oblivion.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And for all I know,
that's what they get.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it sometimes
better to turn off

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
our psychic ability, or should
we always have it turned on?

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I have
talked to people who

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:90%
wish they could turn it off.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And it can become an
annoyance if you're always

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:90%
hearing voices, for example.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't do this.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.665 align:middle line:84%
You talk to people
like the Son of Sam,

00:30:20.665 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:84%
the murderer who claim
there were voices

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:90%
telling him to commit murder.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
There are good reasons
why some people

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.573 align:middle line:90%
might wish to turn it off.

00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:29.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:29.373 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you would think,
initially, people like that

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:90%
are insane.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But then you stop
and think, what

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:84%
if he's possessed
by some demon that's

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.790 align:middle line:90%
really doing this to him?

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.020 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: In fact, Wilson
van Dusen who was chief

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
psychologist at Napa State
Hospital in California wrote

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:90%
an article--

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About this.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah,
I think a book,

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:84%
yes, "The Presence of Spirits
in the World of Madness."

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And he came to the conclusion
that everybody suffering

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:84%
from what we call schizophrenia
was really dealing

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:90%
with spiritual entities.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Young children have
these incredible abilities.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Should we enhance that in
them or try to temper it?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I think it's
important for young children

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:84%
who show talent in
any area, whether it's

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
musical or mathematical
or intuition, that they

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:84%
get support to
cultivate those talents.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not for everybody to
become a great intuitive

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:84%
or a great athlete,
for that matter.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But for those who
have a special gift,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:84%
it's a shame that, when
children are highly intuitive,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:90%
it gets discouraged.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
talked earlier, Jeffrey,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation, what
are your personal beliefs

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.575 align:middle line:90%
about that?

00:31:42.575 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I would
say, at this point,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:90%
the research is overwhelming.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.010 align:middle line:84%
At the University
of Virginia, they

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
have some 2,500 cases
of young children

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
who, as soon as they
can start to talk,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
begin describing
their past lives.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And in about half
of those cases,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
researchers have
collected that information

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and have actually successfully
identified the past life

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:90%
that the child was describing.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's no
doubt, at this point,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that roughly 1,300 cases
of actual reincarnation

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
have been identified
by researchers.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about the
little child from Chicago

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:84%
who believed he was a
World War II fighter

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
pilot, that he flew a
plane called the Concord,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and that he would tell his
parents about this plane.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
There was no way a little kid
would know about this plane.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, Mama,
Daddy, when we landed,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.805 align:middle line:90%
the tires would blow out.

00:32:41.805 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:84%
This was something
the government

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:90%
tried to keep as a secret.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want anybody to know
that they had a defect here.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, it was true.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:84%
How do you get that
kind of information

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.640 align:middle line:90%
unless you experienced it?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, and that
would seem to be the case.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.045 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are critics of
this study who say, well, he

00:33:00.045 --> 00:33:01.045 align:middle line:90%
could've used telepathy.

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
He could've used remote viewing.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.882 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little kid?

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: As I
mentioned earlier,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:90%
little kids can be very psychic.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say the
weight of the evidence

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:84%
supports the simple
reincarnation interpretation.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They took him to a
reunion of some of the World

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
War II veterans when
they were still alive,

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and the little kid recognized
some of the people.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, that's
just unbelievable.

00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And there
are many cases like that.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:84%
This was a particularly strong
case you're referring to.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there are
techniques for training people

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:90%
with psychic abilities.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.940 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, the
most important thing

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.460 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
quiet your mind.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to pick
up psychic information

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
if your mind is busy
chattering all the time.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: So I
would say people

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in
cultivating intuition,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
psychic functioning, the
number one thing they can do

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:90%
is to learn how to relax.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Legendary
psychic, of course,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
is James Von Praagh
had a program

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.182 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia called "Spirit Talk."

00:34:04.182 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VON PRAAGH:
So today, we're

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
psychic ability.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Psychic, psychic
ability, known this?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.510 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
think you're psychic?

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And why didn't you
guys raise your hand?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the truth is,
everybody is psychic.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is born with
what's called intuition.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And intuition means,
into the soul.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the language of the soul.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're all born
with it because it's

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:90%
kind of a survival technique.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We need this in order to
survive and to live life.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
And that is really our--
we're born with it.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a sixth sense.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And we all have it.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:90%
We all possess a sixth sense.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
How many people
here, for instance,

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
have thought about someone, five
minutes later, the phone rings,

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
and it's the first thing
we we're thinking of?

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.289 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:46.843 align:middle line:90%
And you at home, yeah?

00:34:46.843 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Or something you had in your
mind, a vision that happened,

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.560 align:middle line:84%
or a scenario playing in my
mind, and often, the next day

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
it happens.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Those people, yes.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
They're all different
types of intuition

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and how you use your intuition.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can develop
your intuition.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is psychic
from a degree or another.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:84%
There are some souls who
come into this world who

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:84%
have maybe a little bit
more sensitivity than most.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And like myself,
who are empaths.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:10%
We're empaths; we pick up
energy; we feel things.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But every single
person can certainly

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.817 align:middle line:84%
develop their psychic,
their intuition ability.

00:35:18.817 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
People can have this
ability, and you can

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:90%
train people to be even better.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: You can
train people to be

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.390 align:middle line:10%
more consistent with
what they're doing

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:10%
and more persistent.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that you can
train the initial ability,

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:90%
because it's already there.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:84%
In the remote viewing
research, for example,

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:84%
there's this first-time
effect, people

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:84%
who have never done it before
and don't think of themselves

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
in the least bit as psychic,
the first time they do it,

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
they're often amazed at
how detailed and accurate

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:90%
they can be.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:90%
But then the work begins.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
To be able to do that
consistently time after time

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
after time, that
requires discipline.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you say that
successful people have

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.860 align:middle line:84%
an innate ability
to be intuitive.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And these people could be the
Bill Gates, the late Steven

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Jobs from Apple Computer,
people like Mark Zuckerberg

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.127 align:middle line:90%
from Facebook.

00:36:17.127 --> 00:36:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They all appear to--

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk, all these people,
Jeff Bezos from Amazon--

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.085 align:middle line:84%
do they have the
psychic ability?

00:36:23.085 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It's actually--

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must
have something

00:36:25.585 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: --been tested.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1970s, Douglas
Dean at the Newark--

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:84%
then, called the Newark
School of Engineering--

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:84%
took business executives
from successful companies

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and compared them with
business executives whose

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:90%
companies were losing money.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And he gave them a very
simple computerized test

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
of precognition, the
ability to see the future.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
The successful executives
scored above chance--

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way above.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE:
--statistically, yeah.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Those whose companies
were losing money

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.360 align:middle line:90%
showed what we call Psy missing.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They missed the correct
target more often

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:84%
than they should
by chance alone.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's an example,
the Blockbuster Video stores.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
the intuitiveness

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:84%
or the remote viewing ability
to look into the future

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:84%
because they got stuck
with all their stores

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
selling DVDs in an industry
that changed overnight

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to streaming where you didn't
have to go to a video store

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
anymore if you didn't
want to buy this DVD.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You can simply sit back in
the comfort of your home,

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
play with your remote, and
that movie would pop up.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:84%
You might say they got
seduced by their own success.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody didn't--

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: They
were very successful.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody didn't
look for the future.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.500 align:middle line:90%
They weren't intuitive enough.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.845 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did they miss that?

00:37:48.845 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I
think it was because they

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:90%
were so successful.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.357 align:middle line:84%
There were Blockbuster
Video stores everywhere.

00:37:54.357 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everywhere.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: And they were big.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a publicly
held company, and it was big.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, so when you're
experiencing that much success,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.395 align:middle line:84%
what is the motive to
begin to look inside?

00:38:07.395 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think there's
only one store left,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's owned by a private
individual, that's it.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have that
ability to look into the future

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to be
successful, I think,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.650 align:middle line:90%
in anything.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And it's
not just an ability.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the willingness to do so.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Because as I mentioned
earlier, half the people

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
would tell you that I
don't want to do that.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It's diabolic.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not meant for humans.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.315 align:middle line:84%
And another half of the
people will say, ah,

00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as precognition.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a fairytale.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:90%
What is chaos magic, Jeffrey?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: That's
very interesting.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And many, many young people
now are getting into it.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we
can manipulate things

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:90%
with our mind.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that chaos
is going on all around us,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:90%
it's more easy to manipulate.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So people who
practice chaos magic

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
are looking for
those situations,

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:84%
you could say, like a
tornado or a hurricane

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of disaster,
including political disasters,

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
where mental intention
might be able to push things

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:90%
in one direction or another.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't that come back
though and haunt you eventually

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:84%
when you send out that
kind of negativity?

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: If it is negative.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it is.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Chaos magic
needn't be negative.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:90%
It could be very positive.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.710 align:middle line:90%
You could say--

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sounds negative.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It does because
it's a question of somebody

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to impose their
will on a larger situation.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:10%
But I think, to a
greater or lesser extent,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:10%
that's what we all do.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, where
does karma fit into this?

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Karma is a
concept that comes out

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:90%
of the Hindu tradition.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:84%
The research on reincarnation
does not support that notion--

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.875 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: --of karma, no.

00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What goes
around comes around.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, it's
a very popular belief.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.480 align:middle line:90%
As you sew, so shall you reap.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It makes good sense
from spirituality.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the actual
cases of reincarnation,

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%
we don't see examples of karma.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:84%
What we see-- at least
not that kind of karma.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:84%
What we see, instead,
are what you would call--

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
some scholars in the
Hindu tradition--

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the emotional and
psychological tendencies

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.335 align:middle line:84%
that you have in one lifetime
get carried over to the next.

00:40:35.335 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
do you explain this?

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I may be driving down
some street in Los Angeles

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:90%
or wherever I may be.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I see a homeless
person at the corner.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult for
me not to roll down my window

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and give them something.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I'm the same way.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whether it's $5
or $20 or whatever it is,

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
just to pass them.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I keep a
stack of $2 in the car

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.910 align:middle line:90%
just for that purpose.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So without
any motivation in terms

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of wanting something in return,
I'll then go to my PO box,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and there'll be a check
in there from an insurance

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:90%
company for a refund for $250.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It happens almost all the time.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Who's creating this?

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.800 align:middle line:90%
You give, and you get back.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
When you don't plan on it--

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing it
to get anything.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no gain here.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to
work all the time.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's weird.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I think that
you're doing the right thing.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I encourage everybody to
become the very best version

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.452 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're doing.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're not doing
it in the expectation

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
will repay you.

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's nice when it happens.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
ability to create things

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:84%
through your mind and
make things happen.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's possible?

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, we
call it manifestation.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
an example of what

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.650 align:middle line:84%
people who practice chaos
magic and other forms

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of ceremonial magic
and so on intend to do.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It's what Ted Owens was doing
with the UFO that appeared,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.262 align:middle line:90%
and he manifested it.

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manifested it.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.527 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It's
what you're doing

00:42:14.527 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
right now reaching millions of
people on radio and television.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manifesting, creating.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You're manifesting
higher consciousness.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
ripple out into the world

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.162 align:middle line:90%
and create good things.

00:42:29.162 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
use your dream state

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:90%
to get these things done too?

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:90%
I will go to sleep.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But before I do,
I'll concentrate

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.640 align:middle line:84%
on something, somebody,
and I just let it out.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
eventually, it happens.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I feel very
fortunate in my life

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.650 align:middle line:90%
to have been guided by dreams.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Dreams have been responsible
for many of the most important

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.890 align:middle line:90%
decisions I've made in my life.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would sometimes
concentrate, Jeffrey,

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
when I was younger, on
specific jobs that I wanted.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to visualize
the person who was hiring me.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I would know they were
or know about them.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And almost like trying to plant
little seeds into their brain

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:84%
when they're asleep, but,
incredibly, it worked.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, two days later,
after applying for a job,

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd get a call from the person
that come in for an interview.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd get the job
or something like that

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.130 align:middle line:90%
by concentrating on that person.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point where
it was a little scary for me

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because I worked
almost all the time.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Again, is that manifestation?

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.020 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Or is there somebody helping me?

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You know, we
don't have all the answers.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.790 align:middle line:84%
My best way to express it is
to say that the universe will

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:84%
help you when you try to be
the very best person that you

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:90%
can be.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your YouTube channel again.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.320 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: It's called
"New Thinking Allowed,"

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.030 align:middle line:10%
A-L-L-O-W-E-D. You can go
to newthinkingallowed.com.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:10%
And for those
amongst your viewers

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:10%
who want a really serious
education in parapsychology,

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:10%
it's an incredible resource.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If Ted Owens
were alive today,

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:21.080 align:middle line:10%
how would he react to what's
happening in the psychic world

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.300 align:middle line:10%
these days?

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Would he say, my gosh,
everything I said was right,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.620 align:middle line:90%
and now they all agree with me?

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:90%
What would be happening?

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: I think, if
Ted Owens were alive today,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.370 align:middle line:10%
he would be very
disturbed by what's

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.140 align:middle line:10%
been going on in the world.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.860 align:middle line:10%
The way, for
example, species are

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:10%
dying, the way the environment
is being mistreated,

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:10%
the way in which the academic
world is totally ignoring all

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.980 align:middle line:10%
of the important discoveries
in parapsychology

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:84%
He, when he was alive, declared
war against the United States

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:84%
government for their failure
to recognize these things.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect, knowing
his personality,

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:84%
he'd still want to be at
war over these issues.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
My intuitiveness tells
me you loved this program

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.540 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
