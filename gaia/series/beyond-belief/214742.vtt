>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Samantha Fey with us, has
had precognitive dreams

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual visitations
since childhood.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:10%
After foreseeing her
ex-husband's near death,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
she began using her prophetic
gifts to help others.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:10%
She's authored
"Heavenly Alliance"

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
and co-hosted the podcasts
Psychic Teachers and Enlightened

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:10%

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.083 align:middle line:90%
Samantha, welcome back.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SAMANTHA FEY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.538 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I've been great.

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I've been very, very busy.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Excited to have
this new book out

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and thrilled to be
talking with you.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this field?

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: This field.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it definitely
was not planned.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It was not part of my plan to
be in this world of woo-woo.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:10%
But I was teaching English at
our local community college,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:10%
and I was married, and
I had little children.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was married to a
police officer at the time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And I kept having
these dreams that he

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%
would be shot in the neck.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:10%
And about a month later,
that unfortunately

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:10%
came to pass when he
apprehended a criminal.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And I just kept thinking I'd had
strange, intuitive, precognitive

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:10%
things happening to
me my whole life,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.225 align:middle line:10%
and I'd always pushed them
down and turned away from them.

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I was raised Catholic,
and I was trying

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to be a good Catholic girl.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But after that very, very
traumatic experience,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't
deny it any longer.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So I started taking intuitive
development classes,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and it just all
unfolded from there.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
precognitive dreams

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have had
since childhood,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.655 align:middle line:90%
do they continue today?

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, they do.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
a nightly basis.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be
nice if I could just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.378 align:middle line:90%
fall asleep every night and--

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:54.178 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes.

00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: It's just
sometimes, and it's usually

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:90%
really big, important things.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely been a
compass for me in my life.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I'm just very
passionate about telling people

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that this world
of intuition isn't

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
as weird and woo-woo and
metaphysically out there

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
as I think mainstream society
would lead us to believe.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That it really is a tool
that we can use to help

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:90%
enrich our lives.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've had visitations
from light beings, too,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: When I was a little girl,
I had this very strange thing.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell anybody about
it except my older sister.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I was trying
to fall asleep at night,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I would see these--

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I can only describe
them as light beings,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and they would just kind
of come out of the walls.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell me things
to make me feel better.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We moved halfway through
my second grade year,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was really a
troubling time to move.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was being picked on and I
was having a really hard time.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And these light beings
appeared, and they told me

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that the boy who
was picking on me

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
was going through a difficult
time in his own life.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
His parents were
divorcing and that it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
should stop in a couple
of weeks, and it did.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So I had just
several experiences

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little
girl with these beings.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Were they guides?

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Were they angels?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They were faceless.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:90%
They were just light.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they look winged?

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: They did not look winged.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make out any shape.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It was just very comforting
kind of globs of light

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that would sit on the end of
my bed and just comfort me.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they would just sit
with me and say prayers with me.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But it was always
gentle and kind.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't scary.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
when you were 16,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
you had a visitation
or a dream of a monk.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So I often saw a ghost
as a child growing up,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and it always terrified me.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 16,
I woke up in my bed,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
wide awake at 3:00
in the morning,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and there was an older gentleman
dressed in the traditional

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
monk's uniform, with the
brown robe and the rope belts.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And he looked very
kind, and gentle,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and nothing scary
or threatening.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think for anyone
to wake up and just

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
see a stranger in their
bedroom is terrifying.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had seen ghosts
before, as I said.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
They were always see-through.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:90%
And this man was fully formed.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:90%
He was not see-through.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
what do you want?

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't say anything.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:90%
He just smiled.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And I tried squeezing
my eyes and waking up,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
but I was fully awake.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I just got out
of bed and I got on my knees

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and I said, God, I don't
know why I see these things.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I sense these
things, but it terrifies me,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and I want it to stop.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened my
eyes, he was gone.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see another
ghost or anything

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
scary for a long,
long time after that.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you rate
your intuition at that age?

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I would rate it
as just something that

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
was pretty strong, but
I didn't understand it.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to deal with it.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And frankly, it scared me.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It made me feel
different and strange.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember having a dream
when I was in the fifth grade

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that my teacher was
going to be changed,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:90%
that she was going to leave.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I did tell my
parents and my sisters,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of the week,
that teacher was let go,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and we had a new teacher.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I would have dreams that we
would have a pop quiz in class

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
the next day, and I'd go to
school and we'd have a pop quiz.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I understand now that I
should have been like, wow, this

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is kind of cool that I can
do this, but at the time,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:90%
it really scared me.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.635 align:middle line:84%
And when I would talk
to my parents about it,

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
they would say,
oh, Samantha, you

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
have such a beautiful
imagination.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your religion
have anything to do with it?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, definitely.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that being
raised Catholic helped me

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
with my intuition and
hindered me with my intuition

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because I think the beautiful
thing about being Catholic

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is we're taught that there's all
these different tools out there

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
that we can go to for help.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
just bother God.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:90%
We can go to saints and angels.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that leaves you
open to this world of intuition

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and to understanding
that we have guides.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But in the same sense, the
church, my church anyway,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is against yoga, and reiki, and
tarot, and mediumship, and all

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.425 align:middle line:84%
So it did make me feel like I
was going against the faith I

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
was raised in and that I always
found so much comfort in.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And I still do.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I still love going to church.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned that you
saw a vision of your ex-husband

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
being shot.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.065 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then he was shot.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to him?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: He was in a coma
for quite a long time.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:84%
He had to go into a
physical rehab center.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult. He
still suffers today

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%
from an anoxic brain injury.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So we've done-- we
went through years

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and years and years of
recovery and therapy,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
so he's much, much
better now, and he's

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%
able to live a full life.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why have you
stopped doing readings?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I stopped doing
readings a couple of years

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
ago, mainly because I
really wanted to focus

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
on teaching and writing.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I love this modality that
we all are interested in,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
all of us who are here
watching Beyond Belief.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I feel that there are
very few teachers out there that

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
are focused solely on really
helping the person understand

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
the ethics of doing this
work, the huge honor of doing

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:90%
this work.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I really think that when
you do readings for someone,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
you are like a priest
or a therapist.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
People really open
their soul to you.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I kept seeing
a lot of readers

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
do it, to be honest,
kind of unethically.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And it really bothered
me, and I thought,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I really want to focus
on teaching people

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
how to open their
intuition and how

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to share that light with others
in a way that is completely

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
moralistic and
ethical and authentic

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and not just someone who's out
there to be the next James Van

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Praagh or John
Edward, but someone

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
who's really doing this to do
the work for the right reason.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what I told God, I said,
God, I will still do readings

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
why I'm on this Earth,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
but I just don't want to do it
in a business professional way.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, when I meet people,
and if I feel compelled to,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I will pass on a message.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you do it for fun.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I wouldn't
say I do it for fun,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but when I'm called
to do it, I definitely

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:90%
will pass on what I am getting.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your new book, of
course, deals a lot with this,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm so excited
to share this book.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:10%
It's something I've
been passionate about

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:10%
for so long because a lot of
people will come to me and say,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:10%
I love everything that
you teach and write about.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:90%
However, what do we do?

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with our faith
and our enthusiasm and our hope

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and our love of
spirituality when

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:90%
life decides to rain on you?

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote the book to
explain to people that life is--

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:90%
we're not here to be happy.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to have
the happy ever after.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn and grow
and polish off our rough edges.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the book is all about
understanding our soul plan

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and why you're here,
why you have challenges,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:90%
and what your purpose is.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always called
this Earth a school.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like the
Harvard of universities.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're here on
this school of Earth

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.975 align:middle line:84%
to really understand
and evolve and grow.

00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:10.775 align:middle line:90%
So every chapter--

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good school.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.933 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: It's a good school.

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a hard school, but
it's an important one.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned soul plan.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: So I believe that before
we come to this lifetime,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that we sit down with
our guides and our angels

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and we look at
aspects of ourself

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't faced,
that we haven't challenged,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
healed or resolved.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
We look at the near misses
maybe we had in other lifetimes,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.940 align:middle line:84%
where we could have really
shone our light so bright.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And we take all of those missing
bits and pieces of information,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and we put it into a soul plan.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a blueprint when
you're trying to build a house,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you the outline of
what it is you're here to do.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we're
here for one purpose.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that when you really

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
examine your soul purpose, it's
not even a huge overarching soul

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we have many,
many soul purposes.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
purposes change?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think they can
as we evolve and we grow.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our soul plan
can change and evolve, too.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter
in the book on destiny

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
versus free will, because if
you think about a soul plan,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
you might think,
well, wait a minute,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
does that mean that everything
in my life is already pre-fated,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and I just have to ride it out?

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that we carefully
orchestrate different marks

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
along our path that are
going to open up doors to us

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and help us see our light.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I think the one thing that
bothers me so much about people

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that I encounter is
they don't realize

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
how magical and beautiful
and special they are.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all trying
so hard to achieve

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
whatever this idea of success
is, whatever happiness is.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think people forget
that just by being kind

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to someone, just by holding
the door open for someone,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
just by passing on
a complement, you're

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.538 align:middle line:84%
doing so much to grow your
soul and shine your light.

00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is so true.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You had a dream of your
mother's soul purpose.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: That was a
really impactful dream

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:90%
experience I had, George.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So I had-- my
mother passed away,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
but I had a very difficult
relationship with my mother,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to put it lightly.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:90%
She was a very angry woman.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:84%
She had a difficult
childhood, and she was--

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And took it out on you.

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, she was
just not very maternal.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Never hugged or held hands
or that type of thing.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.043 align:middle line:84%
She loved us, but she just
didn't always show it.

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She didn't
know how to show it.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So I had this beautiful, really,
healing dream with her years

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
ago, where we were just
sitting at this table,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and she held my hands.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really made
me take notice in the dream

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
because like I said,
she would never

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:90%
just hug you or hold your hand.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But she held both my hands,
and she said, Samantha,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:90%
how's this working out for you?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what, Mom?

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said, when you
asked me to incarnate and be

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
your mother in this
lifetime as a true bitch,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I agreed because I knew
it would help your soul.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But gosh, it's hard on me
being this angry all the time.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I squeezed her hands,
and I said, I know--

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She knew it.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: She knew it.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Her soul knew it.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I know, Mom.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, but it's
really helping me.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, I thought,
oh, my gosh, did I pick my mom?

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Did I choose to have a
difficult, cantankerous mother

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
on purpose?

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked back and I
thought, well, yeah, of course,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I did, because I'm not going
to say I'm unstoppable,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's made me incredibly
strong and very, very empowered,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.627 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I have learned
how to love myself by myself.

00:12:46.627 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
tell if an individual

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:90%
is having a tough life?

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Sure.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just by their soul?

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think you can tell
it by the way they respond

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
to people in need, the way
they talk about themselves,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:90%
the way they treat themselves.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I think often, people who are
the most loath to ask for help

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and reach out to
connect with others

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that we have
to really, really reach out

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to the most ourselves
because too many people are

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
afraid of being vulnerable,
of asking for help,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
of really showing
their weak spots.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter in the book on
really understanding your shadow

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
side, of really facing
those core inner fears that

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:90%
are holding us back.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we recognize
our soul's purpose?

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
How do we know what
we're here for?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think you have to
look at a couple of things.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you want to
look at childhood interest.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You want to look at those things
that always drew your attention

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%
when you were a child.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
You also want to
look at any activity

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that you do throughout
your day or your week

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
where you lose time, where
you just completely aren't

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
aware of where the time went
because you're so involved

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that--
also, you want

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to pray if it's in
your belief system.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I know for me, when I was having
all those precognitive dreams

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:84%
amping up right around the time
of my ex-husband's shooting,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying to God,
use me to do your will,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:90%
use me to do your will.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
That was my mantra
over and over and over.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:90%
God, use me to do your will.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of this world
of purpose and--

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
it's just been such
a gift and a pleasure

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and an honor to be able
to reach people the way

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I have with my intuition.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
All of that opened up and
unfolded from saying that one

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.793 align:middle line:90%
simple prayer.

00:14:28.793 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
couple of things

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:90%
to find your soul purpose.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a teacher
that left you a letter

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Yeah, I think
I was in kindergarten,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:10%
and I came across this paper
where she had written--

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:10%
you get your little
review from your teacher

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:10%
throughout the year, and she
had written a note and said,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:10%
Samantha was the only one in
class who knew any ghost stories

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:10%
and was able to tell them well.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, oh, my gosh,
even back when I was five,

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:10%
I was interested in and
all this fun, occult stuff,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:10%
and I was able to write fun
ghost stories and share ghost

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:10%
stories.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was really all there
in that one little paragraph

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.473 align:middle line:90%
that she wrote.

00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there anybody
else in your family

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:90%
that had this gift?

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Well, yes.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So my grandmother
was actually called

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:90%
the Irish witch of Long Island.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Irish
witch of Long Island.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, because
she would know things.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
My mother was also
incredibly intuitive,

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think she would
have called herself that.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, she
told my sisters and me

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that she had a little pet bird
called Pedro, a blue bird,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and he would follow us wherever
we went and report back to her.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So every day, she'd give
me $0.50, $1 for milk,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and she'd say, Samantha,
do not buy chocolate milk.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
You already have too much sugar.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I swear
to god, the one time I

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
would get chocolate milk,
I'd come home, and she'd go,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.645 align:middle line:84%
Pedro told me that you
got chocolate milk today.

00:15:57.645 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little
bird spied on you.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: She knew.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
She did that our
whole childhood,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to the point where when
I was in high school

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and my boyfriend was about
to give me my first kiss,

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually looked
around for a blue bird

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
want my mom to know.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on your
boyfriend's shoulder.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Soul plan, can it alter?

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Can you change it?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, you definitely can.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
If life is on a
path that you're not

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
enjoying, that is not
giving you pleasure

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
or worthiness or a sense of
pride, you can change it.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes back to really
focusing on who you are right

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
now and asking
yourself, am I trying

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to achieve A, B, or
C because I want it,

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
because my parents
expect me of it,

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
because my family needs
me to have this job?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It really comes down to
getting authentic and true

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
about who you are and what you
want and what's best for you.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It's something, Dr. Budd Hopkins
called sacred selfishness.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And I really love that
term because we're

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
taught to believe that being
selfish is awful and wrong.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think when you
talk about it in terms

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.445 align:middle line:84%
of sacred selfishness
and just focusing on you

00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and what your heart
is telling you,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that's when you can start
to amend your soul plan.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when, really,
becoming a co-creator

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:84%
with your life comes into play,
and that's when life gets fun.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is shadow work?

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Shadow work is a way
of really examining things

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
in your life that-- things
about your personality

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to see,
that you don't want to address.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet, anything that you
don't address in your own psyche

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:90%
is going to hold you back.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jesus in the
Lost Gospel says,

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
if you do not bring forth what
is within you, what you do not

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:90%
bring forth will destroy you.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Even Jung, he said, until you
make the unconscious conscious,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
it will run your life,
and you will call it fate.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's about looking at those
inner aspects of ourselves

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want to see.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you want to go back
to childhood to look at that.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, my daughters
make fun of me all the time

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because I love
getting my hair done,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.787 align:middle line:90%
and getting my nails done, and--

00:18:05.787 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's wrong with that?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: All of that stuff.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
They're like, mom,
you're so vain.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But I thought about
growing up with my mom, who

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:84%
always prized her children
for being beautiful.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I'm going to
have a shadow side that's going

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
to include a bit of vanity.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm OK with that now
because I've faced it, right?

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I have this vulnerability,
where if I'm talking to someone

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
or I'm doing one of my own shows
and I don't know everything

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
about that topic, I'll tend
to feel a little insecure.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that came from
my dad, who always praised me

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
for being intelligent.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:44.255 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the labels
you were given as a child,

00:18:44.255 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think everyone who's
grown up with multiple siblings

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is labeled in some way, that
will help you figure out

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
what your shadow side is.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
The soul, is it difficult to
pick a life that a soul picks?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I think
that it can be difficult.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
always pick easy souls.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I look at easy lifetimes.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I look at souls in all of
these, almost like, grades.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you know someone who has a
really easy life, great parents,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:84%
super healthy, breezed
through school,

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
always popular, got a
job right out of college,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
they might be like
a first-grader

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
on the timeline of souls.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
They might be a new soul, and
so that's all they can handle

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
are the little challenges.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you meet someone who
has a really difficult life,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
terrible parents, maybe
no parents at all,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:90%
maybe abusive parents.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they couldn't afford
any type of schooling.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they hate their job.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've been married
three or four times.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have
health challenges.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They might be a PhD-level
grad student soul,

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
whereas they're ready to have
the harder, heavier stuff happen

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to them in their lifetime
because their soul is prepared,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and they've been here and
done this many, many times.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we choose
our own parents?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.045 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I believe we do.

00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we do that?

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think we do
that with our guides

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
when we're getting
ready to come to Earth

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're creating
our soul plan.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And I think we're given choices.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating,
if you do psychic--

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
what was-- there was
a great show on years

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
ago called Psychic Kids, and
they would talk about this

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ian Stevenson talked
about this in his research.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Children will talk about
choosing their parents.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And your children might
have said that to you.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.153 align:middle line:84%
I know each of my girls talked
about choosing me as their mom

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
when they were little.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Usually happens when
they're under four.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
My youngest daughter said
to me that God came to her

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and showed her three
sets of parents,

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and she said she picked us.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if I picked my
parents, I did a great job.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, it
sounds like you did.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But some of us will pick parents
that maybe aren't so great,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
but it's always for a reason.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
My favorite story
that Wayne Dyer tells

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is how he says that God came to
him before he was incarnating

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
to Earth and said,
Wayne, what do you

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
want to teach this time around?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And he said, resiliency.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to teach people
to be resilient.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And so God said
to him, all right,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to give
you a father who abandons you,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
another crappy
stepfather figure,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
until you learn
forgiveness and resilience

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and then you can teach it.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And so Wayne always
said that when

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
his mom was in the hospital
giving birth to him,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Dyer's father was at
their house cleaning her out,

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
even took her wedding
rings and left.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stole it?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yep, just
left, abandoned them.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this was in the
late 1930s, of course,

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:90%
before we had social services.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So poor Mrs. Dyer had to
put Wayne and his brother

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
in an orphanage
for several years

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
until she could
afford to raise them.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, he was
going to go through

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
adulthood with some
bitterness and anger.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But once he learned
to let that go,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
he was able to write his
first of many bestsellers

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
and help inspire--

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
he still inspires
all of us today.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I think some of us
choose not-so-great parents,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
but we do it for a
reason because it's

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
helping to grow our
souls and helping

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.822 align:middle line:84%
us to really encourage and
bring more light to the world.

00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about parents, last time

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you were with us, you had
some audio from your father.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And he has passed now, right?

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's listen
in on some of it.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: OK, well, I should say
this is audio-- my father passed

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:10%
from complications connected to
Alzheimer's, and so he really

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:10%
didn't know who we
were most of the time.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But he had this one
moment of lucidity,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was so
astounded by it that I

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:90%
had to record it on my phone.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So the audio quality
is not superb,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
but you will hear what he
was able to see and encounter

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
about the other side
before he crossed over.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's listen.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: I go up, up in
the air around 6 o'clock.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:10%
I've got two places.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:10%
It will happen, not today.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Not today?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:10%
What's the other
place look like?

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:10%
You say you live in two places.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:10%
What's your other
place look like?

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: No one hurts me.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:10%
They feel like there's
something about me.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:10%
But I'm getting very close.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: You're
getting very close?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Yeah, I've got two of me.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:10%
Two of me's.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.448 align:middle line:10%
Soul-- the soul
goes out, goes out.

00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:33.865 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: You'll stay here, and
then your soul will go there?

00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:34.665 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Yeah.

00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't really know
what to do or anything.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: They haven't told you?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: No.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.673 align:middle line:10%
I get it sleeping.

00:23:42.673 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: When you're sleeping?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Sleeping.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: After 8:00
or so, maybe 9:00.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:10%
I go to sleep.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden,
bang, now, I'm there.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.753 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: You're there?

00:23:58.753 --> 00:23:59.553 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Yeah.

00:23:59.553 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: This whole place,
at night, there's you.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Me?

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm there?

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Yeah, and my father, he
said, you are going over there.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:10%
What time is it?

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Almost 5 o'clock.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: 5 o'clock?

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:10%
So that's when it
starts, and he told me.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: What'd he tell you?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: He'll take
everything off of me.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Everything.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:10%
All of this.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:10%
And put me in over
there some place.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:10%
I just went to him.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: You went to him?

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And what'd he say?

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: I have a great place.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:10%
Don't worry about things.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Good.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: It's hard for
me to walk and talk.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:10%
I asked my father, why
are you doing this?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:10%
What did he say?

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:15.063 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: Be nice to the people
and don't worry when it comes.

00:25:15.063 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you feel
about that, Samantha,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:90%
when you hear him again?

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, it's
definitely emotional,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
but it makes me so
happy because I do know

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:90%
that he's in a beautiful place.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he would have these
rare moments of lucidity, which

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
actually happened quite more
frequently before he passed,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, he would
always say that at night,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
when he went to sleep, he
would see me and his father.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And when he mentioned
his dog, Slugger,

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
which was his childhood
dog, I thought, wow,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be something
to that because he had not

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.455 align:middle line:84%
talked about that childhood dog
in a really, really long time.

00:25:50.455 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
they were always

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
trying to get him to go up
the stairs and go with him,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
but he wasn't ready.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it just makes
me happy to know

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that there is a time for each
of us, and we never die alone.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we do go
over, our family

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is there, even our
childhood pets are there,

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.433 align:middle line:84%
and that they're making a
place for him where he's happy.

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I loved when he
said they're going

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to take all of this off of me
because my dad was always--

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
we called him doubting Thomas
because he was raised Catholic,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as well, and was
taught by the Jesuits.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was also
always interested

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in this world of past lives,
and crystals, and yoga,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.787 align:middle line:84%
And he would feel
so guilty, guilty

00:26:30.787 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't a
good Catholic, guilty

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't doing
enough as a father,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.795 align:middle line:84%
guilty that-- he was
always feeling guilty.

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that always troubled
me because I thought

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.023 align:middle line:90%
he was such a great man.

00:26:40.023 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy when
they said they were going

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
to take that all off of him.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.758 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly
what he was saying.

00:26:45.758 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of spirit guides

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%
compared to angels?

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think that angels are
definitely watching over us,

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:84%
but I feel that they only
intervene when we're really

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:90%
off our soul plan, right?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Or if someone and
their soul plan

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:84%
is going to impact our life
path, and it's not preordained.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.455 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the destiny
of our soul path.

00:27:09.455 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:90%
They have to come in.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why you see a
lot of angel stories around car

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
accidents and things like that.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas spirit guides are with
us every day, day in and day

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I'm
teaching about this,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I always compare, spirit guides
are like your classroom teacher.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the
fourth grade, you

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
saw your classroom teacher
every day, seven hours a day.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And angels are
like the principal,

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and you only saw the principal
when stuff was really

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:90%
getting important.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're there
overseeing everything,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe that they're
in the nitty gritty with us

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Whereas spirit guides, they've
lived many lifetimes before,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and they definitely want to
help us to get the most out

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.260 align:middle line:84%
of this time in the
School of Earth.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the movie
It's a Wonderful Life with Jimmy

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Stewart?

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They sent the angel
Clarence down to help him.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that happen?

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, I do think that
we have angels that come down

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.703 align:middle line:90%
and help us for sure.

00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
have spirit guides.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
different types of guides

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.150 align:middle line:90%
that will come and help us.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, if you're at
a moment-- if you remember,

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Clarence only came when he was
ready to jump off that bridge

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and take his own life.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I mean
about how angels will intervene

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
at those really dark nights
of those souls or those times

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
where we're about to
make a choice that's

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:90%
not a part of our soul plan.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
stay with us always?

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I believe that
they are with us.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're with us always.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:84%
God bless if my angel and
guide is with me always.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They must-- I mean,
can you imagine?

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:90%
That must be a difficult job.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know that
poem, Footprints in the Sand?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a classic.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, it is.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For people who don't
know it, I'll paraphrase it.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about a person who
feels as if God let him down.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
where he needed

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
God and he's
walking in the sand,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and he could only
see one footprint,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:90%
which he thought was his.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And God spoke to him
and said, my child,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
it was in your moment of
despair that I carried you,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.980 align:middle line:84%
so you were seeing
God's footprints.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, because he
was carrying that man.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
that as a kid.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My mom pulled it out.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, it's
such a great reminder,

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:84%
because there are times in our
lives where we feel so alone,

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and we feel as though
there's no one out there.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And yet, that's not true.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.927 align:middle line:84%
That couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:29:40.927 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:90%
They are always with us.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I tried to always get

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
through to any students or
listeners to my own show

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking to.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I was thinking a
lot about this this morning.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
main reasons why

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I wrote my book was for my dad
and for people like my dad, who

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.230 align:middle line:84%
go in and out of faith, who
are constantly questioning

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and wondering, OK,
yeah, but if we

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.790 align:middle line:84%
do have angels and
guides, then why am I

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:84%
going through this
challenging experience?

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Why am I having this
health diagnoses?

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
you start to look

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
at it from the lens
of Earth as a school

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and not as just a lifetime,
where you're here to just make

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.855 align:middle line:84%
money and have fun
and fall in love,

00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's so much more
than that, I think, then,

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can see, of
course, you're never alone.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot of
times, when we're

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
going through those
dark nights of the soul,

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:84%
they're like final exams in
your high school physics class,

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and you can't raise your hand
and say to your teacher, hey,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
can you come over and tell
me the answer to number 18?

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
through that test alone.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that teacher is still
sitting there at that desk,

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:84%
monitoring, and
watching, and hoping

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.012 align:middle line:90%
that you all do your best.

00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with
our guides and angels.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
different types of guides?

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.465 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
have one guide that's

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
with us from the
beginning to the end,

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
but we also have guides
that will come and go,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
we're going through.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose
to have children,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
you might have a
parenting guide.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
If you are going
through a health issue,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:84%
you might have a guide
come and help you

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
with compassion and
healing through that event.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
for a job, you might

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.890 align:middle line:84%
have a guide come that
helps you with communication

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and putting your
best foot forward.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have, I kind of
call them assistant guides.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not on your
team the whole journey,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
but they will come to your
team when you need them.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
a dog that died.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, my dog, Lily,
a little Yorkshire terrier.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.120 align:middle line:90%
She was my little buddy.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.450 align:middle line:90%
She passed away three weeks ago.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she gave
you a sign, didn't she?

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, she did.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely beautiful.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
She was very old, and so
we knew it was her time,

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and we had the vet
come to the house.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And my oldest daughter was away.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:10%
She's graduated college and
lives in a different city.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And she texted us and said,
I asked Lily to show us

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:10%
Lily flowers as a sign of her.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And I said, that's so beautiful.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:10%
And the very next
day, her best friend

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:10%
had Lily flowers mailed to her.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, isn't
that beautiful?

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's
such a great reminder

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that when we want confirmation
and validation that our loved

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
ones have gone on to
a different dimension,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:84%
we can call it heaven, the
other side, what have you,

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
if you ask them for specific
signs to show you, they will.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are our
allies on the other side?

00:32:35.522 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: So I believe
that our allies

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
are our spirit guides
and our angels,

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:84%
but also our loved ones who have
gone before us, because they

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
are over there and they
are going to help us, too.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can ask them
for their help.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to be careful about
who you ask for that help.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, for example,
when my mom was dying,

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.370 align:middle line:84%
she knew she was
dying in the hospital.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the last
things she said to me

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:84%
was, Samantha, when I get to
heaven, I'm going to help you.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no
truer words were said,

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
George, because let me tell
you, Jesus himself could not

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:90%
ignore my mother.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.863 align:middle line:84%
She would be like,
are you kidding?

00:33:11.863 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:84%
This girl needs
this done, and she

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
needs to go back on George's
show, and she would get it done.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Whereas my dad was so
kind and soft-spoken.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
I would call him

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
if I needed certain
help with really

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
getting loud stuff
noticed about my path.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be
mindful of who you're

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:90%
calling on for assistance.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you do ask your loved
ones who have gone before you

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
to help you, they will.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
My great grandmother, for
example, came to this country

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:84%
alone with three children,
was able to start a business.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So when I started doing my
own entrepreneurial stuff,

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.088 align:middle line:84%
I definitely called
on her for help.

00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So you want to think
about the people

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:84%
on the other side who
have gone before you

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and really solicit them through
prayer to intervene and help

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.550 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything the
allies cannot help us with?

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, there's a lot
they cannot help us with.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
If something is in our
path, it's in our soul plan,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to happen,
they cannot change that.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example,
my former husband

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
being shot in the line of duty.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
I really feel, for
many, many reasons,

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that was part of
his destined path

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:84%
because it's helped
him grow a lot.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's reshaped our entire family.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So even if he had
asked his grandfather

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to always protect him
and keep him safe,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they could have
prevented that from happening.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was destiny.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: It was destiny.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a bad
way, unfortunately.

00:34:29.662 --> 00:34:30.068 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Right.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think some things in our
life, they're going to happen,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But even during
those moments, there

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
are so many things
our loved ones

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:84%
can do to let us know that
they're with us and giving us

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:90%
support and encouragement.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every step of the way
through his journey of healing,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
we were led to the best doctors,
to some wonderful healing

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:90%
modalities.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.123 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that
was all divinely guided.

00:34:53.123 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do you believe
that there are some things that

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:84%
our allies cannot help us
with or won't help us with?

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: There is a big difference
there, and it could be both.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we
ask for that help--

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about,
George, if you're

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
100 years from now,

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and one of your grandchildren
says, hey, Grandpa George,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.675 align:middle line:84%
can you help me get
into this college?

00:35:16.675 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't you going
to do everything you

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:90%
can to really make that work?

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be hard to say no.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when you really
humbly pray to any higher

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
being that's within your
belief alignment system,

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.990 align:middle line:84%
but especially when you ask
your loved ones to assist you,

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
do what they can,

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:90%
unless it's off your soul plan.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can't
prevent certain things,

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:84%
but like I said before, they
can come in and bring comfort,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:84%
guidance, people that can help
us get through that challenging

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's always a good idea to
call on all of your allies.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Look, we all need all
the help we can get.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%
This is a hard school.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When something happens,
Samantha, is it our destiny,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.327 align:middle line:84%
or have we developed it
on our own free will?

00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I think it depends.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:90%
It can be either.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to look
at the situation.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're making a
series of bad choices

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and then something
bad comes out of that,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part
of your free will.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just going
along through your life,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing
the best you can

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:84%
every single day,
and disaster strikes,

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I think very often, that can
be something that has been

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:90%
preplanned into your soul plan.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
experienced an event

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:90%
that was destined to help you?

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.285 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, I think I've had
several that have happened.

00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the first ones
I mentioned in the book

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.830 align:middle line:84%
sounds very subtle, and yet
it was very profound for me.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:43.540 align:middle line:84%
When I was 14 years old,
my dad entered rehab

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:84%
for a drinking addiction, and
we were all very, very proud

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:90%
of him.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was definitely
a challenging time.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my mom and
I drove up to the center

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:90%
to see him.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And on the left
were all the adults

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and on the right of
this beautiful campus

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.830 align:middle line:90%
were all teenagers my age.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kids of the parents?

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Kids.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.155 align:middle line:90%
No, kids who were in rehab.

00:37:05.155 --> 00:37:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
in rehab, too?

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my mom, how can
you be an alcoholic at 15, 16?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I was so shocked by that.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this
little voice in my head

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that said, pay attention,
this will be important to you.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no, I'm not going
to ever walk down that path,

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.507 align:middle line:84%
so I never knew what
that voice meant.

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, years later, I
go through high school,

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I go through college, and I'm
about to graduate college.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a great
job lined up in the city

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and all my friends
are going to the city.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
recurring little thought

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.095 align:middle line:84%
in the back of my head
to apply to grad school.

00:37:38.095 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, why do I
want to go to grad school?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with school.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And then my advisor told me
about this great program,

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:84%
where I can apply
to this grad school

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and the state of Connecticut
would pay my entire tuition

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:84%
if I just work as a substitute
teacher during the day.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
I could do that.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.718 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great program.

00:37:56.718 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: So I go to
this interview,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's this tiny little
school out in the middle

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere Connecticut.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
Samantha, do you have

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.960 align:middle line:90%
any experience with addiction?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, my dad's
been in AA for eight years.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, the
kids who are coming here,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.650 align:middle line:84%
it's a transitioning high
school for kids coming out of--

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and they named that exact
rehab center my dad was out.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said, have
you ever heard of it?

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:90%
It's called Arms Acres.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, I have heard of it.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we think, based

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:84%
on your essay and some
of the work you've

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:84%
submitted to us, that you have
the knowledge of compassion

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to help these students.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And, George, I just knew.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.782 align:middle line:84%
I knew right then that
that was my destined path,

00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going
to move into the city

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and have a free, fun, amazing
time with all my friends.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:84%
That I was going to
go to grad school

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and become a teacher because
I had that little voice when

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I was 14 that told
me, pay attention,

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.280 align:middle line:84%
this place will be
important to you.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
like a goal book?

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.743 align:middle line:84%
Well, gold books are a
little bit different.

00:38:53.743 --> 00:38:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Goal book is when--

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
a gold book is similar
to a vision board.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
It's when you get to become
the co-creator of your life,

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and you get to decide
what it is that you

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.950 align:middle line:84%
want to bring into your life
so that you're consciously

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:10.510 align:middle line:84%
being aware of our ability
to really bring forth

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:90%
into our life whatever we want.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I think so many of us give
our power away too easily.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
When you work on
creating a goal book,

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:84%
you want to focus on
three to five goals

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that you want to see come
to fruition within the year.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a picture
that represents that goal,

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and you write the goal
underneath that picture

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:90%
in the present tense.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gave us two
pictures of your own goal book.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is from one
of my third goal books.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing goal
books in grad school.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.500 align:middle line:90%
This one's very old.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, there's a
little watermark on the paper.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's
that little cutie?

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: So I cut out a picture--

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching, and I
remember telling my doctor,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to get pregnant
in August and deliver

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in May so I can
have my summer off,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
and she laughed and laughed.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this your baby?

00:39:53.645 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: No, this is
the picture I cut out,

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and I put in my goal book, and
I said, we have a healthy girl.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.987 align:middle line:84%
And then this is my little
daughter who was born in May.

00:40:01.987 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like the picture.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Doesn't it look
just like the picture?

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I always use that when
I'm teaching my manifesting

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
classes to show people
how really profound

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:90%
our subconscious mind is.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.130 align:middle line:84%
If we put out into the universe,
this is what I want to manifest,

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go out
there and seek it for us.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's even going to be very
clearly similar to the picture

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.405 align:middle line:84%
that you are putting
out into the world.

00:40:26.405 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But think about the pictures
that we're putting out

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.985 align:middle line:84%
into the world all the time
without being conscious of it,

00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:90%
when we're being negative.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when you create a
goal book or a vision board,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:41.565 align:middle line:84%
it's reminding yourself to be
positive, to be focused on you

00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and what's really best
for your soul right now.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use
free will often?

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.413 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think we all
use free will often.

00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I think we use it every day.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We should.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: We should, yes.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I think that when
you're working on manifesting,

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:84%
you are incorporating your
free will because you're freely

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
saying to the universe, this is
what I want my life to look like

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is how I'm
going to take action

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:90%
steps to make that happen.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is our shadow?

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I think our shadow
is that side of ourselves that

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
we're not willing to face
that really represents--

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
it can be a darker
side, but it can also

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:84%
be something that you're
just insecure about,

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're using
to dim your light.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had
an experience where

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I got to meet a lot of
listeners to my podcast,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
taking pictures with me,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.665 align:middle line:90%
and it felt so wonderful.

00:41:34.665 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I got back to the hotel
and I called my sister,

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I had
the most amazing weekend.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I met all these listeners, and
I got to give this great talk.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a great
feeling, isn't it?

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: It felt great.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, anyway, anyway,
I'm so sorry to go on and on.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:90%
How was your weekend?

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Samantha,
stop doing that.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful
moment, celebrate it.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, why do I do that?

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.177 align:middle line:90%
I'm so terrified.

00:41:57.177 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You cut yourself short?

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, all the time.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm so afraid to
brag about myself.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a shadow side
that I had to face and address.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's a
negative thing, necessarily,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:84%
but I think I was prizing
being humble way more than I

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:84%
was really taking just a
moment, even a brief moment,

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:90%
to pat myself on the back.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to really
wrestle with that shadow side

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and release her and
let her go with love.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are what
they call the three

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.040 align:middle line:90%
gates to enlightenment?

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: So there are the
gates of suffering, which

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:90%
no one wants to go through.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: The gates of compassion
and the gates of joy.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:90%
But you can't really--

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two out
of three's not bad.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:32.985 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Right.

00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people want to
go right to the gate of joy,

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.870 align:middle line:90%
and who can blame them?

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we can't
really understand joy

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:84%
without understanding
sadness, I think

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:48.050 align:middle line:84%
CS Lewis gave the best speech
on that that I've ever read,

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that we live in this
world of duality,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and so in order to
understand happiness,

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:84%
you do have to
understand sadness.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And so people do
have to understand

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that going through
that gate of suffering

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:90%
is a part of our soul plan.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And in order to have
that sense of joy,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.150 align:middle line:84%
we have to have compassion
for other people.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to really understand
that we're all in this together.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
gates to enlightenment.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've said that
there are four powerful tools

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:90%
to better our own life story.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:20.370 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot
of-- well, there's

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:27.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of-- definitely a lot of
powerful tools that we can use.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I'm
passionate about telling people

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:90%
is to stop asking why.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen to me?

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't this work out for me?

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doubtings.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
focusing on the why--

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:84%
people get so stuck
in their past,

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and they just kind
of stay there.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so
many people alive today

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:52.967 align:middle line:84%
that I feel have died years
before they've actually died.

00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen people
like that, where they--

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.098 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They give up on life.

00:43:56.098 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: They just give up.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because
they get stuck in the why.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And there's no power in the why.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.170 align:middle line:90%
The power lies in the how.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:90%
How can I recover from this?

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:90%
How can I heal from this?

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.800 align:middle line:84%
How can I transform
myself from this?

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
How can I use this experience
to help other people?

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
one of the best tools

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:10%
that we can really use
to enhance our life,

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.350 align:middle line:10%
is flipping the lens on
how we view our life.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.690 align:middle line:10%
We all tell ourselves
a story about our life.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.830 align:middle line:10%
Are you going to tell yourself
a sad story, a dramatic story,

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.430 align:middle line:10%
a horror story, or are
you going to tell yourself

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:10%
the real positive, beautiful
story of who you are?

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
can control that.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, I think that we can.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The power of our
thoughts is huge.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I'm at samanthafey.com.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:10%
So they can find all the
stuff that I'm doing there.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:10%
Or they can check out my
podcast, Psychic Teachers

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.802 align:middle line:10%
and Enlightened Empaths.

00:44:49.802 --> 00:44:51.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the
name of your book.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Heavenly Alliance.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.860 align:middle line:10%
So excited to share
it with everyone.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you, Samantha.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Thank you, George.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me back.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always a pleasure.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.362 align:middle line:90%
Come back again.

00:44:59.362 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I would love it.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
discussion with her.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Every time she's on, I
learn something every day.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
I've learned that we

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:90%
can control our own destiny.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
