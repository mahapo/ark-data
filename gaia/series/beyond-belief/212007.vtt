>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:10%
Maureen Hancock is with
us, a world renowned spirit

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
medium, healer, and author
of "The Medium Next Door."

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:10%
She has helped people
connect with loved ones who

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
have passed on, and
that, my friend,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:10%
is a great tribute to you.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN HANCOCK:
Thank you so much,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and thank you for having me.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I'm doing great.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:90%
How about yourself?

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
How did you become a medium?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: So as a child,
I had lead paint poisoning,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.653 align:middle line:10%
back in the day, when
everything was lead paint-based.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I chewed
on the windowsills.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.863 align:middle line:90%
One of nine family in Boston.

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were you doing
chewing on windowsills?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.732 align:middle line:90%
So, nine kids--

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not very appetizing?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: No.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And they did taste
like Necco Wafers,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:10%
though, so very
sugary, honest to God.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But I ate enough lead to
kill five male adults.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in Children's
Hospital in Boston.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
For three years,
I was in a coma.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three years?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.728 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Three years.

00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I would get to come
home here and there,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and I had acute brain
encephalitis, shunts.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And they created the
process of chelation

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.773 align:middle line:90%
with me to remove heavy metals--

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.857 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: --from your body.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I
started to see spirits

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
walking around the house
as a five-year-old.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm Irish.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:90%
We had a lot of parties.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were
drunken house guests.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:90%
But no, they were spirits.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, I was in a
car accident in 1992.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
I broke every bone in my face.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
driving, a passenger?

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I was driving,
and I fell asleep.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Like one of these-- your eyes
get heavy, and I hit a tree.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my grandmother's
presence go through me.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
She just passed away.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And her voice came
out of my mouth.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Maureen.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And I had a miraculous recovery.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I literally broke everything,
from fractured skull,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
cheeks, nose.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No airbags?

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.545 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: No air
bags back in the day.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what happened.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Exactly.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
brought the jaws of life.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
I was outside of the car.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember how I got out,
but I credit my grandmother.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
hear voices after that.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did this become more
and more prevalent for you,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:90%
the mediumship?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The mediumship,
I blocked at first

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was just
so overwhelming.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.827 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a very anxious person.

00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare you?

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It's scared me.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did to help
soften it is bring comedy in.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a stand up
comedian in Boston.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I was litigation manager.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.758 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You still are.

00:02:46.758 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: And I still am.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll have you
do a skit for us later.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: All
right, I'll do that.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I do a nice Irish
jig, too, George.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love it.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I worked
at Logan Airport,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and then 9/11 happened.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:90%
So my whole life changed.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And I quit my job.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I started a cancer
foundation, doing

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of holistic healing,
and became dubbed the comedian

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of humor, but
I definitely get serious, too.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
help people pass on?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So then I started
working in various hospices.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So my mom was on the board of
directors of a local hospice

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:90%
outside of Boston.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you think I can
help people with meditation,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
laying my hands on them, helping
them to know that death doesn't

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:90%
have to be so scary?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, she let me
start doing that.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, I formed my
own spiritual hospice.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And now, I mostly
work with children.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:10%
What I do is I go in, and
if they're open to it,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:10%
talk about death and dying, and
create a celebration of life.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
families are torn apart

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:90%
during and after the death.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
and that's natural.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Natural.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like if I can help
them to create some signs after

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
the loved one is going to pass,
I have kids say to me-- oh,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
they're the bravest--

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
what's heaven going
to be like, Maureen?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And I talk to them.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or hell?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well, these
are children, George,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to go
right, keep it heavenly.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But you're right,
with adults, they

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
might confess or talk about
what's it going to be like.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:10%
And I say, there's
different layers,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:10%
depending on how
you lived your life.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about it, and
we'll go deep if they want to.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll do lighter fare,
and I'll do meditation.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I teach the family how to
lay their hands on them.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody is
getting ready to come out

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of the physical body,
sometimes, that can be painful.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I want to help them
to understand how they can

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.982 align:middle line:90%
help their loved one release.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
deal with those who

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
are about to die to try
to teach them how to come

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
back and connect with us?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, they'll say
to me, I'm so afraid,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm afraid it's going
to be lights out darkness.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
How do I let them know that
I'm OK when I get there?

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, I teach them how
to lower their vibration

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
because when we come out
of the physical body,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:90%
the vibration is so high.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hoo.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, you need
to lower your vibration.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And the loved one here has
to raise their vibration.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'll sit with the
person about to pass,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
the family member
that wants to connect.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they might
talk about, OK, I'm

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
going to come as something
like a bird or lighter fare

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
turn into the bird.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or an owl.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, or an owl or
a bumblebee or a dragonfly.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But they can use
their energy to make

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.005 align:middle line:84%
it appear, the same way they
can make a dog see them, right?

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
A dog will be like, oh, my god,
that's my loved one-- or a cat.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to come
back as a scorpion.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: You do?

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Just to snap you, bite you.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Just to snap people.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.033 align:middle line:90%
Good for you, right?

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do people say?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
What do they want
to come back as?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: A lot
of people say they

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:90%
want to use things of nature.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So when my dad
passed, he's like, OK,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the
symbol of a cardinal.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
When my mom passed,
she didn't say

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to come as an
oriole, as a symbol, the bird.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So I pull into my
driveway, and I look up,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's an oriole,
the orange and black bird.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:90%
So, me, I'm like, mom, hi.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything good?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
You made it?

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
how those symbols work.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you
real quick, my mom--

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I had surgery last year.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They said I had uterine cancer.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.425 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank God.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: But I was praying--

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:84%
yes, I was praying to
my mom-- give me a sign.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:90%
My mom's name is Grace Agnes.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I go into the
package store that's

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
what we call it
in Boston a packy.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And my mom says get
two bottles of wine

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
for a grief retreat I was
teaching at a Fufu place.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Two bottles of wine, a bottle
of Grace, and a bottle of Agnes

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
right there in front of my face.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said to the clerk,
like, this is my mother.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But then I found out
that I didn't have it,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and the biopsy was negative.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But how great is that, George,
that my mother showed up

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:90%
with her name?

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.712 align:middle line:90%
And I knew she was with me.

00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And now I have
dreams every day of my mom.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
Postcards from Heaven?

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So
Postcards from Heaven

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
is the name of my live event.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So I present to hundreds
of people during the week

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and on the weekends at theaters
and hotels and whatnot.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
Postcards from Heaven

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
because I stop at
different folks

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and say, this woman right
here in the third row,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
your mother, Barbara, is here.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
She was 62.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:90%
She had a heart attack.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:90%
You're one of five.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't talk to your brother
in Florida, things like that.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So I read a lot of
people in a live event.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Unlike a lot of mediums, I
am the Walmart of mediums.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.845 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the greeter, and I'm
giving them out like postcards.

00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at some highlights,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Maureen, from your events.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Your son, I just
heard, I passed unexpectedly,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
so I got a fast feeling.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And he does try to
visit you a lot.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling
you, don't be afraid.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me that he's
much funnier and better

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:90%
looking than you.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:90%
So-- no, that's not even a joke.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Correct, right?

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Because
he's telling me,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
he knows how to
ride a motorcycle.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:90%
He's not an idiot.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:90%
He didn't take chances.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
He was like, slow, bad grandpa.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.694 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it
that was you that

00:08:39.694 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
was trying to reach him not
too long before reaching

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
out or trying to connect
by the phone or something.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm supposed to say
that to you because he is--

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
when I can't breathe,
it's really serious.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But he is like, stop
beating yourself up.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't have saved me.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:90%
But he is-- I'm not gone.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel gone.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I do see him going
around a corner, by the way.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It's how it happened.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:90%
That's how he would ride.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:90%
She just had gotten her license.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
He was always in front.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
She was in the middle.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Papa Bear, the daughter,
and Mama Bear, and we all

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:90%
rode together.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.915 align:middle line:90%
And there's just--

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Because he
knew what he was doing.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm unsettled that night.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't sleep at night.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I have the
vision of his accident.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: He's OK, though.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%
He's OK, though.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
He's like, if you keep
going back to that,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:90%
then we can't go forward.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.357 align:middle line:84%
I also want to bring up
this table Helen or Ellen.

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Ellen.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Ellen?

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's your daughter's name?

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Ellen, he wants to
acknowledge you.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And thanking you for
getting mom here.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:90%
This almost didn't happen.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
So he's excited, right?

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is
acknowledging everything

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:90%
that you do for everybody.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you have the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.160 align:middle line:84%
He just said, you did
everything for me.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to know that.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.848 align:middle line:84%
And your husband
has passed, right?

00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:08.648 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:08.648 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he was
there to greet him.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, your mother
was there to greet him.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But they are together,
and they are OK.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're fishing,
or they have a boat.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So what's that about?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They're
like, yeah, go away.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.565 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:25.273 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the favorite
they did together.

00:10:25.273 --> 00:10:27.277 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The favorite
thing they did together.

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This gets to
be emotional, Maureen,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.205 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:31.005 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It does.

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I noticed half
of them were crying.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And that's why
I use the lightness because

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:90%
of raising the energy.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I cry all the
way home because I can feel it,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I could
reach everybody

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
to tell them that there is
no death, that we don't die,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that this is the least vehicle,
and they're stepping out,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and to teach folks how
to be their own medium.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
That's really
important for my work,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that we all have this to
see, feel, hear and sense.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to relight the
spiritual pilot in the world.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
teach the living grief?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Because it's overwhelming.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I've had three friends die
in the last five years,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:90%
all unexpected, all close.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It's tough.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It's really hard.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, the first thing
I say, it's OK to grieve,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
but trying not to get
stuck in that place.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Because so many do
want the validation

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
that they're still with us.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to get that
if you're an overthinker,

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
if you are stuck in your grief--

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And I always suggest a
grief counselor or somebody

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that's better suited to go a
little bit deeper than I am.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And my biggest message
is, you know what, they

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
say that they feel younger.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
They feel vibrant,
if that's the case.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And that they say
I don't feel dead.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.132 align:middle line:90%
They don't die.

00:11:51.132 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're alive.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They are
very much alive,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.895 align:middle line:84%
and it's just on
this other level.

00:11:55.895 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And we won't know fully till
we get there, right, George?

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.903 align:middle line:90%
But I get lots of visitations.

00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: we are in
no rush to get there.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: No rush.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's just--

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when it
happens, it happens.

00:12:04.538 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example of how
they communicate sometimes

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:90%
through electronics.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many
different stories.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you have one?

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, I do.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So one mother who lost
her son, tragic drowning,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
five years old.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I still remember his name--

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Jackson.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five years old.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And she
said to me, Maureen,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I would go by Jackson's
room, and I would say,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
if you're here, make
the light bulb flash.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And it would flash.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And then I
said, you know what,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
go back inside into the room
and have conversations with him.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
use electronics.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, she would say,
Jackson, if you're here,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I want three flashes--

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:90%
boom, boom, boom.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they did a little
Morse code, I guess,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
in spirit communication.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One for yes, two
for no, that kind of thing?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: 100%.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.395 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I was
in Martha's Vineyard.

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever been there.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Love it.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to go to
Fitchburg all the time.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I love
that, Fitchburg.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, I go in, and
I'm talking to my mom.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just play
around sometimes.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, mom, can
you make the light flash?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.115 align:middle line:84%
So I did a video, talking to
my mother through the light.

00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:16.915 align:middle line:90%
And

00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was flashing?

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, it was flashing.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, make it go off.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm science-minded, too.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I need 30 seconds.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Energy cannot die
or be destroyed,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and I want to prove
this to everybody.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother went
along with it in spirit.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a dream,
and she hugged me.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- I said,
I missed talking to you.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, but
I'm right here.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: We're right here.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use
your dream state

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the dead?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I really do.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So the strangest
thing for me, knowing

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
what I know, my parents, for the
last two years, my mom and dad,

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
are showing up every
single night in my dream.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
sound a little wonky.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm at an all-inclusive
resort, George.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I swear to God.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like that's going
to be my screensaver of heaven.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:90%
We all have one.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And I love all-inclusive.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But they're showing
up, and there we are.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:90%
But my mom's giving me messages.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, my
soul is taking in.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And others, I remember when I
wake up, and I write it down.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell everybody, keep
a pad of paper next to your bed

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and write things down because
you're going to forget.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But then, I ask myself, is
this real, or is that real?

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm writing about
that in my second book

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
right now, about what
is actually the reality?

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:90%
This is Earth school?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still living
in the dream state.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a lot done, too.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the dead try
to use to communicate with us?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: So they would use--

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are their tools?

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.702 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: They'll use
all sorts of things.

00:14:47.702 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:90%
So they'll call our name, right?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you're clairaudient,
like me, in you're hearing,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I will hear conversations
in my mind's voice.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't come in a man's
voice, like, hey, it's Arthur.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
It's more like my voice.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So they're giving me messages.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Look over your shoulder
when you're driving.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They're using heart-shaped
rocks on the beach.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
They're using
rainbows and things

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in the sky and orbs and
pictures and videos.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can see their faces
in photographs sometimes.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:90%
So they'll use electronics.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They're going to use
anything of nature, so a deer

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:90%
or typical any type of bird.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
lighter fare, and they

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
can use the energy to manipulate
it to come in your path.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Coins, feathers, all
kinds of stuff like that.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And those are the typical signs.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they jokesters?

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Some are jokesters.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I connect at
Postcards from Heaven,

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll take on the personality.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell if somebody was
super quiet or shy, or private.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And then other times--

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually sometimes take on
their voice, their mannerisms,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's a little
bit of channeling.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot out
of me to do that.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.047 align:middle line:84%
But they can be jokesters,
and they hide things a lot.

00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
best way, Maureen,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to connect with our loved
ones in our dream state?

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: In our
dream state, if you

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
think of a favorite memory
or maybe the last time

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
you saw them, I say
for 3 to 5 minutes.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So I want folks to think about
maybe a holiday or a vacation

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
you took, or maybe just
seeing them in the kitchen,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and go through it
for three minutes.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
It opens a portal to the
other side, the other level,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And they can slip
into the dream state.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If you are preparing
yourself to open up to that

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying to them,
I give you permission.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
You're saying to them, I
want to communicate with you,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I can't do it
in my daily life.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.815 align:middle line:84%
I need to do it in the dream
state because we're more open.

00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple
of your clients

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
showed us how they communicate
with their deceased children.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:90%
It's truly remarkable.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Before my son passed away
in 2022 from a car accident,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I was not a very
spiritual person.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Then two months
later, my ex-wife

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
scheduled a session
with Maureen.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I tragically lost my
13-year-old daughter about 20

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:90%
months ago.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.922 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to admit, I went
in acting very little.

00:17:23.922 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I was a skeptic.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But I kept an open mind,
which was great because I

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
left that session blown away.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a reading
from Maureen Hancock,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and she told us things that
no one would ever know.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Maureen described my
son's personality to a T.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It was like she had known
him for a long time.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
She also described the
night of the accident,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
the events around it,
and the accident itself

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:90%
very accurately.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just validation after
validation that she's still

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
here with us, currently
and presently involved

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Furthermore, she described
what was going on in our lives

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
at that moment and things that
we had planned to do to honor

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
our boy at his
old middle school,

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
including a bench in
his honor and pavers.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And all that, of
course, she was simply

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
being the messenger, channeling
what he was telling her.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Maureen has given me the
tools to really communicate

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
with my daughter, which
has helped me tremendously.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Life continues, just
in a different dimension,

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and we can continue that
relationship with our son,

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
even though he's in a
different dimension.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's been amazing.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It's been a game changer.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine how much harder
this incredibly painful journey

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
would have been,
if we didn't have

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge,
if we didn't have

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that faith and the
relationship that we have,

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and all the signs.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> She's given me
the tools, really,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to know that she's still with
me and know that she's not going

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:90%
She's not dead.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
She's just different.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So not only
is it helping the dead,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:90%
but you help the living.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, definitely.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
My sister's son passed at
19 years old tragically,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:84%
back in the day, when I
used to do private readings.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I dropped the list,
the wait list,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and I only see,
still to this day,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
for free, parents who have
recently lost children

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
because I want to teach them how
to connect with their children.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And Mario, this gentleman,
very science-minded,

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and he was a huge skeptic.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And he has a whole
new world now,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
not just a non-physical
relationship with his son,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:84%
but he's open to so
many things now because

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
of this tragic physical
passing of his son.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And with Wendy, I taught
her how to meditate

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and how to raise her vibration
so that they have full blown

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.025 align:middle line:90%
conversations in her head now.

00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
some of the best ways

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the other side?

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The best ways to
connect are-- first of all,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to get your mind,
body, and soul connected.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So I teach about clean eating,
maybe doing an organic diet

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of sugar
and anything that's

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
going to fog your thinking
and the heavy, heavy diet

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
that we're used to, right?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And meditating and
getting out in nature.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:90%
So I tree bathe every day.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:10%
I go out with my dogs.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I get
ready to get on stage.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
But learning how to quiet
your mind so that you

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
can lead with your heart
and not overthinking

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%
is the number one tool for you.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So folks that say I
don't feel anything.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't get anything.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, would you be open
to learning how to meditate?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I teach them the
mindfulness meditation,

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're eating right, and
they're getting enough sleep.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And it really-- got health.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything ties
together when we're

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
trying to be an instrument
to the other side.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
You have said that
there is no death.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So I feel that when
we leave the physical body,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
this spirit body continues.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel that we
are way up in the sky.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Or people always looking
up where are you?

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Show me.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:90%
They tell me, I'm right here.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm right here.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And my own mother
is telling me that,

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:90%
who was head of the God squad--

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Irish Catholic.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a
lot of faith, but I

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:90%
study all different religions.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And I have witnessed miracles.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that we are
just this spirit body within,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
waiting to come
out and continue.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
happening all at once.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe there's
a past, present, or future.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel everything's
happening simultaneously.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And you probably heard
that many times before.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really starting to learn
that with my work with death

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:90%
and dying.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Law enforcement
reaches out to you now.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So I have had
law enforcement reach out

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:84%
to me for the
past, say, 20 years

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
on missing person
cases, murders,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
cold cases and whatnot.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And I got into that side of
things, even by accident.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So I had some private
detectives reach out

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
on a local case
to Massachusetts.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had me
go up to the area

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
where this girl
disappeared, Maura Murray.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So she hit a tree, and
then she just disappeared.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, they wouldn't say
anything, huge skeptics.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're driving for
hours up to New Hampshire,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
and then I started to feel sick.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
know spirit's near,

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that she
had crossed over.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you get sick all
the time when you feel spirits?

00:23:04.402 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: If it was a
murder, I feel nauseous.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I feel sick.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
And so, I had them pull over.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
this is the area.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them
to say anything.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I become the victim
first, so I'm

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:90%
looking out from their eyes.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reliving, and I
can see what's going on.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Then, I do remote viewing.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I come up and over an area.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I become one with
the energy of a perpetrator.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So that I'm looking
out from their eyes.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:90%
So I have the whole story.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you,
working with FBI and police,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and teaching them
about intuition--

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:90%
greatest joy.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have more luck
with missing folks

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:90%
who are newly missing.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So you know how they say
the first 48 hours are key?

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So, same for me in a
missing person cases.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
That first week, I've had luck
helping the police find mostly

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.300 align:middle line:84%
living teens that
are disappearing

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:90%
or going missing a lot lately.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the missing
person come to you,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
or do you go to them
with this intuitiveness?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:90%
So I work with mapping.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, I would get
the cylinder, like on "The Brady

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Bunch."

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would open
up the map, and I

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.968 align:middle line:84%
would wave my hands over and
feel, energetically, the spot.

00:24:24.968 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a pendulum would?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kind of thing.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would feel hot,
hot, hot, right?

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'd X, and I'd say,
OK, this is where they are.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, they would
find their body there.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
If they were deceased,
they do come to me,

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
if I'm looking at photos
and I call them in.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But I have more luck
going to the area.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So if I go to an area--

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel it?

00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I felt it.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had a missing gentleman
in his 50s in my area.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, I walked with
the police along a river.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, he's in the river.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But he is about
10 miles up here.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And they did end up finding
him there, unfortunately.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
But he was coming to me.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And if I look at a picture
and their eyes are just dull,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:90%
they're still alive.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:84%
If their eyes are
bright and it's

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
like they're talking to me--

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wide open.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I can tell if they passed.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the eyes and the photo that
speak to me, and it's the soul.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever
catch the killer?

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So if it's
a murder, sometimes.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So this one, in particular,
they haven't caught them.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's one in Quincy,
Massachusetts, where there

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:90%
was a missing exchange student.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And I worked on that case.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I could
hear her saying to me,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:90%
it was the maintenance man.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:90%
So he is in jail.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you have
to remove the stucco,

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that the DNA and some DNA
stuff was behind the wall.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And they did find it.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let me tell
you about John Lacrosse,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
former police chief in the
small town in Rhode Island,

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
shares how you helped connect
with his deceased brother.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:90%
My name is John Lacrosse.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a retired Rhode Island
State trooper of 23 years

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and then chief of
police in a small town

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:90%
in Rhode Island for 17 years.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But I met Maureen Hancock
in September of 2006.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I went to a holistic
mediumship class

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
because I was learning how
to become a Reiki master.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:10%
And Maureen started
doing readings

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:10%
for people in this
class, and she read me.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm being a cop and a
detective for eight years.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
She really hit home
all the key factors

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of my brother, who had
died some 27 years ago.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing to me,
being a detective and a police

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
officer, how she was so
accurate with this energy.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
She trained me and told me
to believe in my intuition.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, I know
Maureen has worked

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
on many cases for law
enforcement, two or three,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
when I was a chief
in Barrington,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and helped solve these cases--
missing persons and persons

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:90%
unsolved murders.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So Maureen and I
became good friends.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And she taught me
a lot about energy

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:10%
and connecting to spirit,
trusting my intuition.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And being a police officer,
you need good intuition.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a Reiki master,
trusting the energy,

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
client, and then

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
connecting to people that I saw
while giving these sessions.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:10%
And thinking as a
cop, it was weird,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.140 align:middle line:10%
but it was a great lesson.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:10%
And Maureen became
a very good friend

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:10%
of mine and a good mentor.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget it.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I did,
back in 2006, was

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I got a picture of my brother,
laminated it, and put it

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.110 align:middle line:84%
over that police cruiser
visor, and talked to him daily

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and got signs from him.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I became a true believer
because of Maureen's gift.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does the picture
seem to enhance your ability

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:90%
to communicate?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
I feel like when

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
you look at a photo
of a past loved one

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and going back to
looking in the eyes,

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:84%
you can access the energy
of the soul, I feel.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
with John Lacrosse,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that he then used his intuition
for his cases in town.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And he works with the
Samaritans because his brother

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
passed by suicide.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And having that picture--

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't always need a
picture, but that's psychometry.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It helps.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:90%
So you can hold the picture.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You can hold an item, a piece
of jewelry, maybe the clothing

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.540 align:middle line:84%
because it still holds
energy of that loved one.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maureen, are all
law enforcement officers

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
behind what you do, or
are they on the fence?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, no.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit probably 50/50,

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
but I do think a lot
are coming around.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So I speak at these
National FBI Conventions.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's about 500
guys with their arms

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
crossed and a few
women, and more now,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:90%
though, with the women.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, they don't
believe at first.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But when I go right to them
and I connect with their loved

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:90%
ones, I can see them soften.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And if anything, I teach
them about we were all

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:84%
born with the ability to
see, feel, hear, and sense,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.063 align:middle line:84%
not only our loved
ones, but our intuition.

00:29:20.063 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So some are
better than others.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And some
are better than others.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, John Lacrosse is a
practicing almost medium now.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he has opened
up to the energy.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But I still have some, and
they'll say right to me,

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeptic.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.823 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a
local police chief.

00:29:36.823 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I don't
believe in what you do.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, you don't have
to, but my work is free.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And I will come in
and help you, and I

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
helped find a missing
teenager last year

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
in the woods in
Canton, Massachusetts.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the
case where you found a child

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:90%
in a closet or something.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.485 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, my goodness.

00:29:56.485 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So there was a missing teenager
from Boston, Massachusetts,

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:90%
about two years ago.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, I met with
the mom on Zoom

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
because it was around
the time of COVID.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as I connected
with the mother on Zoom,

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:10%
her deceased loved
ones came through

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:10%
and gave me the
information instead

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:10%
of looking at the maps and
the pictures and whatnot.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, she met
somebody on Snapchat.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:10%
I am seeing Seaver Street
in Roxbury, right outside

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:10%
of Boston--

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:10%
part of Boston.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And I said, there's a triple--

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
so in my mind's eye, I could
see a white triple decker.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:90%
She was on the third floor.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And I could see her in a
closet in the back room.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Even with my eyes
open, I can see this.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK,
well, that sounds

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:84%
like the house the
FBI just cleared.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:10%
But let me call them
and get back to you.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So she's like, yeah,
they cleared it.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, she's in there.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Tell them to go back.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Give them my name.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:90%
If you want, I'll talk to them.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes, I just go
through the family, not always

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:90%
the police.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So they went back in, and
they found her in the closet

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:90%
on the third floor.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:84%
She was about to
be trafficked out

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:90%
of the country, had all the--

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I have chills right now.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saved her life.

00:31:14.057 --> 00:31:16.915 align:middle line:84%
>> And I did, and I credit
her mother's grandmother.

00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they keep in
touch with you afterwards?

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: haven't with those
folks, but, normally, they do.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And I do keep in touch.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And some folks, like Wendy
that you saw and Nick's dad,

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:90%
we are forever friends.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So I have so many, that I
stay in touch with them,

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and then just teaching
them that they can have

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a non-physical relationship.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:90%
We all can.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you mix and
combine your comedic background

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
with what you do as
a psychic medium?

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, when
after my car accident,

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:90%
nobody really believed me.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.385 align:middle line:84%
And my own Catholic mother
was like, I don't know.

00:31:56.385 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
should be doing that.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.625 align:middle line:84%
And we worked with some
priest friends of ours.

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't go
there, Maureen.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.683 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Don't go there.

00:32:03.683 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But hey, gifts of
the Holy Spirit,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Corinthians 12:11, but whatever.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.590 align:middle line:10%
So getting back to
that using the comedy,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:10%
I was on stage as a
comedian in Boston,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:10%
working at Logan Airport,
litigation manager,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:10%
and then the accident happened.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.100 align:middle line:90%
So I found that when I--

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:84%
because I get nervous, so I
use comedy when I'm nervous.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I could
see people's aura open up

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:90%
with the comedy.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And folks say to me
now, I can't believe

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I went into your show
Postcards from Heaven.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:90%
So sad.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.945 align:middle line:90%
And I left so happy--

00:32:36.945 --> 00:32:37.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: upbeat.

00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: --and
upbeat and hopeful.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So I use comedy to bring
hope to the masses.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the
female Don Rickles?

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I don't
know about Don Rickles.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But I might be a little bit
more like Amy Schumer mixed

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:90%
with some dead people on--

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:90%
maybe Don Rickles, yeah.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who comes
to your events?

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: So I get a mix.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started,
mostly women, and mostly

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
women between, I
would say, 30 and 65.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, I have a
lot of young folks.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have from, say, 15
years old to 90 years old.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I did an event last
week in Rhode Island--

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
750 people, half of them were
men because of the comedy.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All age brackets?

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: All age
brackets because I

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
feel there's such a shift
right now, that everybody's

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:90%
opening up to the possibility.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the comedy
makes it more able to accept.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are men
showing up so much?

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.210 align:middle line:90%
What are they looking for?

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I think they're
looking for connection,

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:90%
clarity--

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.578 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peace of mind.

00:33:46.578 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: --peace of mind.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:90%
And I used--

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Closure?

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Closure.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I used to stay away
from the skeptics

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
because they scared me,
and they'd be like, mm.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.423 align:middle line:90%
But now, I go right up.

00:33:57.423 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Embrace them.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And now I feel like
I get so many messages after,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:90%
like I was such a skeptic.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And women, too.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, now, we're in such
a state that we need hope,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
but I can't stress enough.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I say to people,
you are all mediums.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand
if you get signs.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, raise your
hand if you feel nothing.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Half the room raised their hand.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:90%
Are you an overthinker?

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Are you trying too hard?

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I teach them how
to be their own medium.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Maureen
Hancock University?

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, so I created
the Maureen Hancock Online

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.910 align:middle line:90%
University to teach people.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Online?

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, so
they get about a year's

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:90%
worth of short little lessons.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know about you,
but I have the short attention

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:90%
span, right?

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a squirrel.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's 7 to 10 minute little
video clips, and everything

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
from chakras to auras, energy,
cold cases, psychometry,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we meet once a month,
live, for an hour and a half,

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
with, I say, about
50 students online.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We meditate.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:90%
I answer questions.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I have them
practice reading people.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like they feel
safer behind a chat box,

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:90%
or they're not put on the spot.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, the other
night, I had a class,

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
so many beginners, reading
people, connecting.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call once
on one of my local shows

00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in Saint Louis from
a guy who says,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
George, I belong to a
chronic compulsive club.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:84%
We're very compulsive
about everything.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you do?

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, we meet.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, really?

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:90%
How often?

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:90%
He says, six times a day.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: That's amazing.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that,
throughout the day,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.640 align:middle line:90%
we're all getting messages.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We're all being guided,
and we're all just

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
like walking each other
home, whatever that means.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's giving us
these messages, and why?

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Well,
we all have a team,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe, of our spirit guides
that we're assigned at birth.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And so we have--

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I call it the three tiers.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.390 align:middle line:90%
So we have guardian angels.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We have spirit guides, and
we have loved ones in spirit.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that, also, we keep
coming back to this Earth

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:84%
school to learn heavy
lessons, to forgive,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and to laugh with all
our might, and just try

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:90%
to help each other out.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:90%
But who's guiding us mostly?

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we have
one or two spirit loved

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:90%
ones that are helping us.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, for me, I
always had this woman

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:84%
with long, curly blonde hair,
and I had a Native American say

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to me, a shaman, oh,
do you know that woman?

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:90%
She's a guide for you.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting you gave
an impromptu reading to somebody

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.030 align:middle line:90%
at a drive in, didn't you?

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Sometimes, at the
drive-through, I do tend to--

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't do a reading,
but if it comes to me,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and I feel they need it,
I'll give the message.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've got it on tape.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Medium next door,
Maureen Hancock, this is Abby.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.045 align:middle line:84%
And her great grandmother
just started to come through,

00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and then a younger male
came through and said

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:90%
that he had an overdose.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
It was her cousin, Seth?

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, and he was
just like, tell my mom I'm OK.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's
one of two, right?

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Does
he have a brother?

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: He's trying
to help his brother.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.710 align:middle line:84%
His brother holds
everything in, and he's just

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:84%
like mostly wants like-- and
his dad went his own way,

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.115 align:middle line:90%
like it's too hard for him.

00:37:24.115 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's, tell
them I loved them.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.615 align:middle line:90%
They did everything for me.

00:37:26.615 --> 00:37:27.890 align:middle line:90%
They never gave up on me.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Tell them not to feel guilty.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And he's just wicked--

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:90%
just wicked cool.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:84%
His mother finds
heart-shaped rocks for him,

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and she has a tattoo
in his writing.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you know that?

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god, yeah.

00:37:38.787 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: She does?

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he does.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, my
god, this is crazy.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So how do you feel, Abby?

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.535 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel-- it's just crazy how,
oh, my god, how accurate it is.

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: And you're so open.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Hugs from heaven.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Did you love the
wicked, wicked Boston accent?

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I loved the wicked,
wicked Boston accent.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And so,
this woman said to me,

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted to see you.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'll always gauge
because you never

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:84%
know if it could be
triggering for somebody.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I work with grief
counselors that help me out

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:15.250 align:middle line:90%
in my retreats.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But that
was pretty amazing.

00:38:17.115 --> 00:38:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did these
intuitive things come to you?

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So I will get a lot
of clairaudient connections.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So for this woman,
I just looked up,

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and I could see her a nephew
or a cousin or something

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.820 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm hearing, I'm
feeling, or they'll tell me.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So he was like, OK,
I passed suddenly.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:90%
It was my own actions.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Tell everybody, I'm sorry.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:90%
So I'm hearing that.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, sometimes,
I'll feel on my body,

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, this person had
a stomach illness

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
because my stomach will go,
bzzt, or I can't breathe.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.247 align:middle line:84%
Or I get a head pain,
like a glioblastoma.

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get very into this.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And then
I'll get more specific

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.718 align:middle line:84%
because I also do medical
intuitive stuff as well.

00:38:58.718 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're writing
a new book, I hear.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I am.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So the working title is "What
to expect when expecting death."

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
If you've heard of what to
expect series for bringing life

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.010 align:middle line:84%
into this world, I feel
like there isn't really

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
any gauge or a book or
some kind of a thing

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:90%
to help people to go out.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's before,
during, and after, how

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I work with families, the advice
I give through death and dying.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And then what's going to happen
after, setting up the signs,

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we talked
about to help people not be

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.680 align:middle line:90%
so fearful about death.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear you're
getting help with this book.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.887 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I'm getting help.

00:39:39.887 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From your mother.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.548 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, I am.

00:39:42.548 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I thought you were just
connecting with my mother.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, is she
telling you that?

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And we're all mediums.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So my mom, she helped me with my
first book when she was alive.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And now, she keeps guiding me.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.330 align:middle line:90%
And she is really nudging me.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the first book in two
months with her help, living,

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and now she's helping me.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the
title, by the way--

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:90%
what to expect.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
going to use that.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But we need some guidebook,
I think, to help people

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.035 align:middle line:84%
and for families
to stick together.

00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
so many breakups.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
Tibetans and the Egyptians

00:40:15.285 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
wrote their book of the dead
as a guide for the other side.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the same
thing for modern people.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Modern, yes.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And I love that.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And wow, I was in Mexico
and visited by the Mayans.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I was told I couldn't
have children.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Mayans
came to me and said,

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
you need to go to Tulum and
sit on the fertility pole.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.345 align:middle line:90%
I had a baby.

00:40:37.345 --> 00:40:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't supposed to.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Two kids.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not right
there on the spot.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.565 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, definitely.

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:43.365 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:40:43.365 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is not one
of your comic jokes, right?

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: And this is for real.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is real.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I put that
in the first book,

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.488 align:middle line:90%
"The Medium Next Door."

00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
one will probably

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:90%
be a little bit more serious.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But you're right,
it's the modern guide

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.373 align:middle line:90%
to death, dying, the afterlife.

00:40:57.373 --> 00:40:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: So people can
find me at my website,

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:10%
maureenhancock.com, Instagram,
Medium Maureen Hancock.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.020 align:middle line:10%
On Facebook, it's the
Maureen Hancock Fan Page.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on TikTok,
Medium Maureen Hancock.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me one
of your comic bits.

00:41:14.962 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Oftentimes,
when I'm doing readings,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll do from the movie "Ghost."

Orlando, is that you?

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Whoopi Goldberg.

00:41:24.743 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Damn, baby, what
did you do to your hair?

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It's autumn sunrise.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Do you like it?

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And just like with
Whoopi, who thought--

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:90%
she was a skeptic.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:90%
She was really channeling.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: So there you go.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.878 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Thank
you for having me.

00:41:38.878 --> 00:41:39.870 align:middle line:90%
This was such a joy.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm in no rush to go
to the other side by any means.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:10%
But with people like Maureen
Hancock, I'm prepared,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.410 align:middle line:10%
and I understand.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And when that day
comes, I'll be ready.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
