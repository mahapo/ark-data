00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:10%
We have a very special guest
for you in this program.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
His name is William
Henry, and William

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.754 align:middle line:84%
has been a guest
of mine on Coast

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to Coast for 13
years now, dealing

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
mythological stories.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
He is an investigative
mythologist,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and he is also a
regular guest and host

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of Gaia TV programs.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
William, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we call you an
investigative mythologist, what

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:90%
is that?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Well, it's
kind of like being

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:10%
an investigative journalist,
except my specialty

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:10%
is mythology, ancient
stories, especially stories

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:10%
about human transformation.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I love these stories where a
human is taken into the stars

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and transformed into an angel
and brought back to Earth.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:10%
So I just started calling myself
an investigative mythologist

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
to separate myself and
to narrow my focus.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing work.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that what happened
in the ancient times is still

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.657 align:middle line:90%
happening today?

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we find so much of it is
cyclical of what we experience.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the
archetypal nature of humanity.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
stories or dramas

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:90%
that we're always enacting.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hero's journey
as they call it in Hollywood,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
where we just keep recycling the
same story over and over again.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.006 align:middle line:84%
And that's the value
of investigating

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
these ancient stories,
is to find a way

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to navigate our way
through the story

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and have a more
successful outcome.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You taught me
about stargates and portals.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
they were right.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I started investigating
what you were talking about,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
what you were writing
about in your books.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going whoa,
there are actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
stargates, portals
to other universes.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Those were
such exciting days.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're going
back to 2002 or so,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein looking for
the Stargate of the Anunnaki

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
obsessed with that.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Obsessed with
it, as many of us were.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:10%
We had watched the movie
"Stargate" and "Contact,"

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:10%
and we wondered, is it is
it true that there were

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:10%
ancient portals and gateways?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out the
mythic tradition,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
the sacred literature
is loaded with stories

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.381 align:middle line:84%
of portals, vortexes, and
stargates, and even wormholes.

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a guest that
appears on Coast to Coast

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:90%
regularly.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:90%
His name's David Paulides.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:10%
And he's written a
book about people that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:10%
disappear in our park systems.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
A parent could be
with their child,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:90%
who is two feet behind him.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
He turns and the
kid is gone right.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
An animal didn't grab him.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
You would have heard the
screaming, the yelling, right?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:90%
The sound of the animal.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
It was because of
what you've taught me

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
about portals and stargates that
led me to believe in the theory

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that maybe in some
of these park systems

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
there are these portals, and
the kid just walked right

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:90%
into one--

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.955 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he can't walk back.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the idea is the
portals and stargates

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:90%
operate on frequency.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Sort of like our radio.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we're walking along,
we're tuned to one station,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing one reality.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But if we just slightly
turn the dial either way,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.115 align:middle line:84%
we're in a different frequency,
in a different reality.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You pick up
my radio show, then.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, exactly.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When somebody walks
through a stargate, what's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.717 align:middle line:90%
on the other side?

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, it depends.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can take a stargate
that will lead you to a point

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
beyond Earth, maybe
another star system,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
perhaps another dimension,
even a whole other galaxy.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you're
dealing with something

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
called ascension phenomenon.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.319 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
ascension is something

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the ancients were obsessed
with, this idea that humans

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
can cross over the boundary
between the material

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and the immaterial realm,
between Earth and heaven.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It used to be, in
the Old Testament,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, that if God
wanted you to come to heaven,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.121 align:middle line:84%
he'd send you an invitation and
open the pearly gates for you.

00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A one-way trip.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: A one-way trip.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
a revolution that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
started to happen
around 600 BC or so,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
where humans started to
say, well, wait a minute.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We can take it upon ourselves
to transform ourselves,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to purify ourselves,
to perfect ourselves,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and to ascend to the
level of the gods,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and that humans, in fact,
can open the doors and gates

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:90%
to heaven on their own.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
spiritual or pure in order

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.839 align:middle line:90%
to create that ascension?

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I believe that you do.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are two schools.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
One, that you can pry open the
door through some kind of maybe

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:90%
magic or even technology.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The traditional image of
the stargate from the movies

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is that flesh and blood is
going through a stargate,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
like in the movies, they can
take their bodies with them,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.664 align:middle line:84%
or even take a nuclear missile,
which I don't believe in.

00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Or, the alternative
is that you have

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
to fundamentally
transform the body

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:90%
into a next level of vibration.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
They call it the light
body, the ascension

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:90%
body, the resurrection body.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:90%
This is what Jesus did.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
He took his flesh
and blood body--

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He went
up into this cloud.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Rearranged it, upgraded
the vibration of the body,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
transformed it into
a body of light,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and now exists in another realm.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he do
that on his own,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
or did something else very
spiritual do that to him?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, kind
of a confluence,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
really, because
there are factors

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
where he had tremendous yogic
powers that he had developed

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:90%
in his travels in the East.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But also there was an
oil that was involved,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
an anointing oil that has
very mysterious powers.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
the story of Enoch,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
a pre-flood sage,
maybe an Atlantean,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
who's taken into the heavens
by the archangel Michael.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
This is an ascension story.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And Michael anoints
Enoch's body with an oil,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and it dissolves into
rainbow-colored light,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.157 align:middle line:84%
so now his body matches the
celestial flesh of the angels.

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
that, that there's

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.554 align:middle line:84%
an oil that could
dissolve our body.

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something that would be
readily available on the planet

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Not readily available.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But certainly sages like Mary
Magdalene was a noted perfumer

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and an oil expert,
and she is the one

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
who applied this
oil that may have

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.164 align:middle line:84%
been involved in the dissolving
of Jesus's body into light.

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.746 align:middle line:84%
Which created the
Shroud of Turin.

00:06:23.746 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:90%
That's an icon of that event.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have said for
years that we are light beings.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.565 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
what that means is

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that we all have a true
nature that is essentially

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:90%
a being of light.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the Gnostic perspective
and other enlightenment

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
traditions, they teach that
our primordial light body

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:84%
form actually manifests the
flesh and blood physical body,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
where we're said to be
made in the image of God.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And the image of God isn't one
of these humanoid-type forms.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Rather it's this
light body form.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet they call it the
rainbow body of light.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's described in artwork
as a five-colored light body

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:90%
that we can all manifest.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:90%
We all have it within us.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially
covered over by--

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
they call it false
perceptions of the Earth life

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and of our flesh
and blood existence.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem
that meditation brings out

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:90%
more powers within our body?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, meditation
stills the mind

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and it opens the heart.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is where our
true spiritual capacities

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.249 align:middle line:90%
and true spiritual powers dwell.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My little
five-year-old granddaughter is

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:90%
into meditation--

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Good for her.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And yoga.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
My daughter-in-law sent
me a picture of her.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know, she's
only about this tall,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and she's sitting down
with her eyes closed

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and their hands like this,
sitting down, of course.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:90%
And you could tell, though--

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
you could almost see,
William, a light around her.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.525 align:middle line:90%
It was really weird.

00:07:58.525 --> 00:07:59.858 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, I'm sure you can.

00:07:59.858 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I don't know
if she was generating that

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
or whether I was able to
see it in the photograph,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like in that
kind of state of mind,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:90%
you illuminate more.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
describe, again,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
as our true nature,
this light being,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that you can perceive
it, and you can certainly

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%
feel it coming off some people.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And the object of the
spiritual traditions

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
is to take our emphasis
off the flesh and blood

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and put it on perfecting
the light body,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
or connecting with
the light body.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is the thought process

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
to get into that state of
mind to be able to do that?

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, it's everything,
really, because ascension

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
is another word for wholeness.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And our human quest is to become
and feel more whole, more holy,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
more complete.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And so as you tap into this--

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I call it ascension
intelligence--

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
you're actually tapping into the
same intelligence of the angels

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and the sages and the
enlightened beings.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So just by committing to
the path of wholeness,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
now you're opening
up whole new avenues

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
within your consciousness.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
movie called "Lucy"

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
where it dealt with all kinds
of things with the brain

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and altering the brain.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.626 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
- Are you sure you
need such huge doses?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid you won't survive.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:84%
- Some cells inside me
will fight and defend

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
their integrity
till the very end.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
In order to attain
the last few percent,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.092 align:middle line:84%
I have to force it to crack the
cells open to their nucleus.

00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:90%
- This knowledge, Lucy.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even sure that
mankind is ready for it.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We're so driven by
power and profit.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Given man's nature,
it might bring us

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:90%
only instability and chaos.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
- Ignorance brings
chaos, not knowledge.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll build a computer and
all my knowledge in it.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.172 align:middle line:84%
I'll find a way for you
to have access to it.

00:09:55.172 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I just hope we will be
worthy of your sacrifice.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I guess
she was making reference

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to the power of
her brain, right?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yes, she was,
the expanded capacities

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful
sequence in the movie where

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I think she's at like
40%, and she actually

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%
dissolves into the rainbow body.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the
producers of the film

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%
did a great job of showing that.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they get that?

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.259 align:middle line:90%
How would they understand that?

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: How would the
producers understand that?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the
creative areas, they just

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
download stuff without
having any awareness of what

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%
they're really talking about.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Having worked some
in Hollywood, I

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
know some actors
are deeply into some

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Gnostic or esoteric
arts, and they intentionally

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
will put some of these ideas
and concepts in their films.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But other times, I think
they're just getting lucky.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
I've known you for years.

00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
You've always been
upbeat, full of energy.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen you down.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I am sure you have ups and
downs in your personal life.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But you always seem
to be ascending.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
How do you get yourself
into that state of mind?

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, one, I do
believe in reincarnation.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But I also recognize the
preciousness of this life.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We have a finite time
in these earthly bodies.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Goes by too fast.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.686 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It goes by so fast.

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Way too fast.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And so why not utilize
this time to reach

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
as high as you possibly can?

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I won't turn
myself into an angel,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
but if that's my North
Star, then that's

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:90%
going to guide my life.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like a lot
of people are like ships

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
asail on the ocean,
maybe lost, and they

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
are looking for that North
Star to guide themselves by.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And for me the North Star is
humans can become an angel.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:90%
The Essenes taught this.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundational
idea of early Christianity.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhists had the same idea.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So over and over again in
these spiritual traditions,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
they are always
insisting, hey, you

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
appear to connect
yourself with this body,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
but there's actually a greater
self that's awaiting awakening.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this
tell you about life itself?

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why are we here?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Why were we created?

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And what is this tie-in with
this energy and portals and all

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I
think we're here

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
as agents of our creator
to love one another

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.439 align:middle line:84%
and to be messages
of God's love.

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
the big test for us?

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.188 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's the big test.

00:12:21.188 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
they already apprehended
that 5,000 years ago,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:90%
that all of life is a test.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately our heart will
be weighed against the feather

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic truth.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And if our heart weighs
less than the feather,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
we continue on the
spiral of evolution

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:90%
into greater cosmic beinghood.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
If not, there's a
recycling program,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and we keep doing it
over and over again

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.860 align:middle line:84%
until we awaken the
power of the heart.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
are passing the test.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.474 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people aren't.

00:12:50.474 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's right.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And then others pass
the test and come back

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
to assist others
to pass the test.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a continuous cycle
of evolution in that way.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people will ask

00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
me, tell me about telepathy.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this
connection that we all have.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I simply say,
we're all connected.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a wireless universe
where William Henry's on it,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
George Noory's on it, so
many other people are on it.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
What is this tie-in with
this cosmic intelligence?

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.827 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:13:21.827 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, it's fascinating.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
archaeologists-- in fact,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
one here in Boulder,
Colorado that

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
claims that there's
archaeological evidence

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
of the development
of a super brain,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the activation of our neocortex,
no later than 75,000 years ago.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
75,000 years ago

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
that sparked the activation
of our neocortex.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't know if it was
cooking food, cooking meat,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic substances, some
kind of cosmic rays coming

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:84%
from the center of the galaxy,
or Cygnus, or wherever.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe not
the brain at all.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Maybe not
the brain at all.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But something caused us
to activate our neocortex

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and join our brains together
in a collective super brain.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what enables us
to read each other's minds

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and have empathy and
connect with one another.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe
in good and bad.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I do.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Evil
forces, good forces.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Are they constantly at odds?

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Always.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
this universe go around.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:84%
That's that image
of the caduceus,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
where you have the two serpents
entwined around a central rod.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate goal is to get
them to harmonize in the sun

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.497 align:middle line:90%
disk or the light disk on top.

00:14:28.497 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of where
we're at right now,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
is you have these conflicting
forces that are locked up

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and spitting at one another.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And our goal as
a civilization is

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to get them to both say
yes to the same thing.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm thinking
we need to say yes to

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:84%
is the ascension of
the human species

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond homo sapiens
into the next better

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:90%
version of ourselves.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.672 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What could
that next version be?

00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: There's two choices.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.560 align:middle line:84%
One, we're going to evolve into
spiritual light beings, which

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
millions of people around the
world now are practicing yoga,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:90%
doing meditation.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
history, simultaneously,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
millions of people
getting together

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and developing their
spiritual powers.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:90%
That's one path.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The other path could
be through technology,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to start
applying the best of Silicon

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Valley technology
into our human body,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and augmenting our intelligence
through nanotechnology,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and other technologies
that vastly

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.297 align:middle line:84%
amplify the power of our
brain and our consciousness.

00:15:24.297 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That'll be
dramatic, I think.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
The technology, if it
keeps at this pace,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:90%
will be absolutely dramatic.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And we will see a
dramatic increase

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:84%
in this, and revelation
of it, within five years.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 years, 20
years at the most,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
we will not recognize our world.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.097 align:middle line:90%
We will see robots everywhere.

00:15:43.097 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doing everything.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.263 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Doing everything.

00:15:45.263 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Most people will be unemployed.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not getting into
a driverless car, William.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You'll never get me
up in one of those things.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're sitting the
back seat and something fails.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Technology fails.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It does.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happens?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%
You're up a creek.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You're up
a creek, exactly.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's happening so
fast, and most people

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
are unaware of the development
of artificial intelligence,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, and how
our culture is now

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
completely dependent on
artificial intelligence.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Any time you're online,
whenever you're making a phone

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
call with your smart phone,
when you're buying something

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
on Amazon or Netflix,
you're utilizing

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
increasing in its power.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fast food stores now
are experimenting with robots

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.050 align:middle line:90%
bringing you your food.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're right.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They are going to
replace human beings.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen to
society if unemployment

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.724 align:middle line:90%
triples, for example?

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It will
more than triple.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
As much as 90% of us
will not have a job.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.029 align:middle line:84%
We're talking lawyers,
doctors especially.

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.084 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, exactly.

00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't considered
the ramifications of that.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Nor have the powers
that be, our leaders,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:84%
let us in on that this
is what's happening.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is within 10 years.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you'd have a
robot represent you in court,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.521 align:middle line:84%
You'll go to a
doctor, and the doctor

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.514 align:middle line:84%
will be an artificial
intelligent entity.

00:17:03.514 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He'll plug
something in and say

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:84%
exactly what's wrong with
you and give you a remedy.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.856 align:middle line:84%
Now this could be really
good for some people.

00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:12.472 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a rural area,
or if you're in a third world

00:17:12.472 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
country, for example, where
there aren't very many doctors.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:84%
That would be
wonderful for them.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:90%
So there are upsides to this.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The robot would be
a cheap date to take out,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it?

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.235 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
that's where you're

00:17:22.235 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
going to see the real robot
revolution as with the sexbots.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And already in the EU
there's legislation in place

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.284 align:middle line:90%
where you can marry your robot.

00:17:30.284 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And robots have right.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
got to be kidding.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.675 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, I'm not.

00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:33.476 align:middle line:90%
Robots have rights.

00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:34.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Prenups?

00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, prenups.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Robots have rights.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:90%
So they can tax them.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you think
artificial intelligence will

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:10%
get to the point--
and we've seen movies

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:10%
where these robots communicate
with you, they reason with you,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:10%
they have emotion with you.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:10%
They could even violate
the laws of Isaac Asimov

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:10%
and do things they're
not supposed to do.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Will it come down to that?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And the question is how soon.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
answers is they think

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.625 align:middle line:84%
it could be as soon
as 2020 where we will

00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:90%
see what you're describing.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
just in a few years.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.926 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's right.

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
They call that artificial
general intelligence,

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.749 align:middle line:84%
where the machines are as
smart as humans or smarter.

00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step is-- and
this is the big, scary part--

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.619 align:middle line:84%
is artificial super
intelligence, where

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the machines are just a little
bit smarter than humans,

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps a billion
times smarter than humans,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:90%
and they have their own agendas.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They set their own goals.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would be
interesting is interviewing

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:10%
a robot, sitting where you're
sitting, doing a Beyond Belief

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:10%
show, conducting an interview
with a robot who would actually

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:10%
reason and answer.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: This
happened in Sweden,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:10%
where an artificially
intelligent bot was

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:10%
interviewed.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And the bot said,
well, give us a chance.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Give robots a chance.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
You might really like us,
and you can benefit from us.

>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
That was the robot's opinion?

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the artificially
intelligent robot's opinion.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.804 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
saying, give us a chance.

00:19:01.804 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.761 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's very scary.

00:19:03.761 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And most people are unaware
of how advanced it is

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and how pervasive it is.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.382 align:middle line:84%
And it's only going to get
more and more pervasive.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they
get to the point

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
where they will be able to
build things on their own?

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They already are.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.537 align:middle line:84%
They're writing
their own algorithms,

00:19:17.537 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and this is a big problem.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They're a black box
now, where scientists

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
say we don't understand how
the AI entities are coming up

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:90%
with their conclusions.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's
now, again, in the EU,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
legislation that says
a human has the right

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to demand that the entity reveal
how it came to its conclusions,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
because right now, they're
beyond our control,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.427 align:middle line:90%
and beyond our understanding.

00:19:41.427 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got to be a
dark side to this, William.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.676 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's what
we're talking about here.

00:19:45.676 --> 00:19:50.307 align:middle line:84%
Is this artificial intelligence
alien intelligence?

00:19:50.307 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Did it come from somewhere else?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly contact
with a new alien entity.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
dark side of this,

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.872 align:middle line:84%
where these machines are making
decisions for and about humans.

00:20:01.872 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And humans have no
idea how they're

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:90%
coming to these conclusions.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So the next step is where
the artificially intelligent

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:84%
entities begin to make plans
and programs for humanity,

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's where it
gets really scary.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And my solution
to this is that we

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
have to develop our
ascension intelligence,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:90%
another form of AI.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We all have these yogic
abilities within us,

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.399 align:middle line:90%
telekinesis, the ability to--

00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telepathy, everything.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Mind over matter.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.022 align:middle line:84%
And as we develop these
aspects of our consciousness,

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I think what we'll
find is we don't

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:90%
need artificial intelligence.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
We can use our own
ascended intelligence

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:90%
to build a better civilization.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if we do
that, how far can we go?

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
that's the question.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's unlimited
where we can go.

00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
movies like "Lucy"

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
are so phenomenal,
because they start

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.582 align:middle line:84%
to paint this picture
that hey, wait a minute.

00:20:54.582 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've
been so conditioned

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
to think that we're just this
little tiny dot of nothingness

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and we're insignificant.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But in the cosmic scheme of
things, we are everything.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we focus our attention
on our flesh and blood bodies,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and our material
existence, we will

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
continue to feed that kind
of dark side program that

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
says that we're powerless
and insignificant.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But if we start to
focus on our true nature

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.994 align:middle line:84%
as light beings of
celestial origin,

00:21:22.994 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
then we realize, hey,
wait a minute, I'm

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
an unlimited being who
allowed myself to incarnate

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in this limited existence
for whatever reason,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
to work out karma as a messenger
of love from the creator,

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and I have
the capability within me

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to return to my state
of unlimited being--

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
now we start to activate
our ascension intelligence.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will this
make us immortal?

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Will we live forever?

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We don't
want to be immortal.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
achieve immortality.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.728 align:middle line:84%
Immortality means
we're going to be

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.155 align:middle line:90%
trapped in this realm longer.

00:21:54.155 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
This is what Silicon Valley
promotes, that hey, you

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:90%
want to live 1,000 years.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, maybe I do.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But what I really want
is to become an ascended

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
being where I have my
full cosmic consciousness

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
like the angels,
like the saints.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us is
capable of attaining

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
that level of consciousness.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%

Christian way of ascension

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

- Think of this, too, Jesus'
ascension, now, in his body,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:90%
ascending to Heaven.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean a space
trip like up into the sky.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
What it means is the translation
of this earthly reality

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:90%
into the heavenly dimension.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And notice how the
ascension of Jesus

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
is correlated to Pentecost,
the descent of the Holy Spirit.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
As something of Earth goes
up into the heavenly realm,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
something of Heaven comes
down to the earthly realm.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the meeting of
Heaven and Earth,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
the transfiguration
of Earth by Heaven.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.307 align:middle line:84%
That's what's at stake in both
the ascension and in Pentecost.

>>NOORY: I like
the way you explain

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the Jesus ascension a little
better than the priest did.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
What he's describing there
comes from the Essenes.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were
master scholars who

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
were working on this idea of how
we go from a caterpillar form,

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
analogously, into
our butterfly form.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the ascension
represents with Jesus,

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is he's gone from the
caterpillar or pupal phase

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
into the butterfly
form, the fully--

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.219 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great analogy.

00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But the problem
is that many of us

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
hear about that, well,
only Jesus did that.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
That's traditional Christianity.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we can't do that.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.425 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: You can't do that.

00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But whereas Gnostic
Christianity and the Essenes

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:90%
said, everybody can do this.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody
starts working on this,

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
we will completely
transform our planet.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll take back the power
from the powers that be.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
In the time of
Jesus, it was Rome.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
In our current era, it's maybe
technology, maybe a new world

order or something like that.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But the answer is
always that all of us

And this is where people
develop--and this is based

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:84%
on an ancient idea-- that there
are entities that have entered

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
into human consciousness or the
human thought sphere that seeks

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to keep us at odds with one
another in order to harvest,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe, an energy from us
or something like that,

don't want to destroy us.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
They view Earth as a
farm, a plantation,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're sort of producers
of an energetic substance

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to assist us in our
spiritual development.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem that
our ancients were a little more

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.235 align:middle line:90%
adept at this than we are today?

00:25:23.235 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, when you
look back at those stories,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
we're always glorifying
certain of these individuals.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But life was just as
tough then as it is now.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:90%
But again--

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they seemed
to be into this more.

00:25:34.906 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Like you mentioned the
Buddhists and people from Tibet,

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
they seemed to understand this.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They wrote the book
"The Tibetan Book

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead," "The
Egyptian Book of the Dead."

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:90%
They understood ascension.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think most
people understand.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's
changing, though.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel it changing?

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
was saying earlier,

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.558 align:middle line:84%
where now, for the
first time in history,

00:25:55.558 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you've got millions of people
practicing yoga, meditating.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
This is all part
of the ascension.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.038 align:middle line:84%
This is what they're
actually aiming for.

00:26:03.038 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not just--
in the moment they're

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
looking for relaxation
and stillness

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and to tap personal power.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate fulfillment
of what they're doing

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
is the ascension of
themselves as individuals

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and also all of
humanity collectively.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
it mean by raising

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%
your frequency for ascension?

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, raising your
frequency is a convenient way

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:90%
for us to talk about this.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
In Nashville, where
I live, there's

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:84%
a famous writer
named Dave Ramsey.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:84%
He teaches people how
to get out of debt.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's the
economic Dave Ramsey.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:90%
We know Dave.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:84%
He's got as much radio
affiliates as I have.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Geez.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Powerful.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.669 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy for people to
know when they get out of debt

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
because they can look
at their bank balance

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and they have more money, right?

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.557 align:middle line:84%
So as you start to ascend,
then how can you equate that?

00:26:50.557 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what
I've been challenged

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
with as a teacher of
ascension, if you will,

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
is how does someone
know when they're

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:90%
raising their frequency?

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that I
offer is that, based

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
on an ancient story,
the Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:84%
we're told that all of us
are 2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:13.269 align:middle line:84%
So if a fully developed human
is symbolized by a circle--

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
wholeness represents,

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
is a circle-- and a circle is
360 degrees, then 2/3 divide

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:90%
means 290 out of 360, right?

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So we all start out
basically around 290,

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
at the frequency
of 290, which means

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that mentally, physically,
spiritually and emotionally,

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
we're all doing certain things
that reflect our life at 290.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
My challenge to people
is to say, well,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.504 align:middle line:84%
if you were at, say,
310 on that scale,

00:27:40.504 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
would you be doing
the same things

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you do you're doing now
mentally, physically,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.148 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, and emotionally?

00:27:45.148 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.979 align:middle line:84%
You would be doing
different things.

00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:90%
You would raise your frequency.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.144 align:middle line:84%
You would change the
food that you're eating,

00:27:51.144 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts that
you're thinking,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
the physical actions
that you're doing,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that
you're feeling.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
raise your frequency,

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
go into your imagination and
think, well, when I'm at 310

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:84%
on that scale, what
will I be doing?

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:90%
What will I be eating?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:90%
What will I be thinking?

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:90%
What will I be reading?

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you get to that 310?

00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You start
doing those things

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that you know you'll be
doing when you're at 310.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there any
obstacles, William,

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:90%
to ascension, that hold us back?

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, just ourselves.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.559 align:middle line:90%
It's purely about belief.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do it to ourselves.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.391 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, we
do it to ourselves.

00:28:23.391 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:90%
We self-limit ourselves.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
We're God given,
unlimited beings,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.384 align:middle line:84%
but we decide through
our consciousness,

00:28:30.384 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell if you
meet somebody instantly

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
if they are in that ascension
mode by their personality?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: You can.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean there is
definitely a certain vibrance

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.959 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
detect, maybe a charisma.

00:28:45.959 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Upbeat people,
generally, are more into this--

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.235 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Absolutely,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:28:50.235 --> 00:28:52.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Than negative
people, psychic vampires,

00:28:52.255 --> 00:28:53.460 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a positive
outlook is definitely

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
a hallmark of a person
on the path of ascension.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
How much has to do with
just being a good person?

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Everything.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that's
what it's all about.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Every spiritual tradition, you
don't have to float in mid air.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
focus on is having

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:90%
a pure heart, a light heart.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You call this
"our beautiful moment."

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, we're
at this time in history

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:84%
where we are the
bridge between the past

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and all of future humanity.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The decisions that
we're making right now

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
will affect humans
for all eternity.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether we decide to link with
the artificial intelligence

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:84%
machines and forever
change ourselves

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.660 align:middle line:84%
by packing our flesh
with technology,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
or whether we
decide to take more

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual or
yogic path, that decision

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.387 align:middle line:84%
is going to greatly
impact all future beings.

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I call this
"our beautiful moment."

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it as a dark moment.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a very powerful
choice that's been given to us.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're excited
about this moment.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.276 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Very excited.

00:29:58.276 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, truly grateful to
be alive at this moment,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and to be thinking about
this, and talking about it,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and assisting people in
making that decision.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can any of
this backfire on us?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I hate to throw in
a cog here in this,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.915 align:middle line:90%
but can anything go wrong?

00:30:13.915 --> 00:30:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I feel that if we
follow the spiritual path, no,

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:84%
nothing will go wrong,
because our intention is

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to move ourselves forward into
a more whole and holy species.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have done
extensive work in this field

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:90%
all your life.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.271 align:middle line:84%
For you personally, what
has it done for you?

00:30:33.271 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, it's given
me a lot of confidence

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
in the belief that life
goes on, and that each

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:84%
of my individual
thoughts matter.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:90%
What I do makes a difference.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And as individuals
really begin to believe

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that about themselves, you
become more self-responsible.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:90%
You become more self-aware.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately that leads to
your own self-realization,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the fulfillment of
your true capability.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to look back and
say, oh, I wish I had done this

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:90%
or I wish I had done that.

study by Constantino Brumidi
for the monumental painted dome

in the United States Capitol
here in Washington, DC.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi was awarded
what was then

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:10%
the most ambitious and
expensive commission

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.280 align:middle line:10%
of a federal work of art.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:10%

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:10%
Born and raised
in Europe, he was

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:10%
steeped in the European
tradition of large scale

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:10%
allegorical paintings in
churches and state buildings.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:10%
Here he presents
George Washington

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:10%
as the father of
our country, flanked

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:10%
by the allegorical figures
of liberty and freedom.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:10%
He is surrounded by
vignettes extolling

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:10%
the virtues of
American invention

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:10%
and forward-looking
progress, but he also

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:10%
is surmounted by 13 allegorical
figures, each of which

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:10%
represents one of the
13 original colonies.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
there on Coast to Coast

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
looking up at the
dome, weren't you?

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I decoded all the ascension
symbolism in the dome.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I worked very closely with Dr.
Barbara Walden, the curator

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.930 align:middle line:90%
of the United States Capitol.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me free
range in the capitol

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because at our first
meeting she said,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
we know there are mysteries
about this fresco that you're

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.655 align:middle line:84%
looking at here,
and in the capitol,

00:32:29.655 --> 00:32:31.405 align:middle line:84%
and we're happy to let
you wander around--

00:32:31.405 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't know
what it was, though, did they?

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, they didn't.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
liked my approach to it.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I came in one
day with an image--

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:84%
see, George Washington on the
rainbow is an ascended being.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I matched that together
with the Christian images

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:84%
of the ascended
Jesus on a rainbow.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Walden's eyes
got big as saucers.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
She's like, how come we've
never seen this before?

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:54.742 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how come they knew
about it then and we had to--

00:32:54.742 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:84%
look at all the years
it took for someone

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:90%
like you to decipher it.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.632 align:middle line:84%
And Constantino Brumidi is a
very interesting character.

00:33:00.632 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
He had been trained
by the Vatican,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and he knew all the
Vatican secrets.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up coming to
America with those secrets

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and painted those in the
dome of the US capitol.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
That ascension dome is one of
the key alchemical diagrams

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
of all time and actually
encodes the secrets about humans

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
transform themselves
into angels,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.824 align:middle line:84%
which is the ultimate
liberty that we all share.

00:33:21.824 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what the founding
fathers were talking about.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.939 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would the Sistine
Chapel be the same?

00:33:26.939 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The Sistine Chapel is
definitely a place of secrets.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo's
paintings in there,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:84%
frescoes, are
absolutely mind blowing.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I love visiting the Vatican.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I love all of Italy.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just a great
philosopher stone, in a way.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we reach this
higher state of consciousness--

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: When.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When-- that's
a little more positive--

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:90%
what happens to us?

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, suddenly
there's an explosion

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.450 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be rather
like Edwin Hubble when he first

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:10%
pointed his telescope
at the Andromeda nebula

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.942 align:middle line:10%
and realized that it was a
whole separate galaxy from ours.

00:34:07.942 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they went crazy.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And then
they went crazy.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
And now we know there's as
many as a trillion galaxies.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago they
didn't know this.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
And I think spiritually, we're
on the verge of something

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:84%
like that, incomprehensible
to us at this moment

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:84%
just as it was incomprehensible
100 years ago, that there's

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
a trillion galaxies
out there full of life.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.601 align:middle line:84%
And so now with this
spiritual transformation

00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, it's going

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:90%
to be something like that.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
What exactly it is I
can't say for sure,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be on
that order of magnitude,

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
where 50 years from now
people look back and go,

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:90%
you didn't know blah blah blah?

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
And now we know we're part of
this wondrous living universe.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we end up
without physical bodies

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.400 align:middle line:84%
if we keep ascending
to this level?

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:10%
That is the ultimate
goal of ascension,

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:10%
is to transcend the
flesh and blood body.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that once
you attain this ascension,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
you can phase back and forth
into your physical body

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:90%
any time you like.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there'll still be
need for the physical world.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Angels don't have sex.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poor angels.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
that they'd like

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate in
the physical body

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.525 align:middle line:84%
because there's
physical pleasures.

00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:84%
There's things
you can experience

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.358 align:middle line:84%
in this beautiful planet that
you can't experience anywhere

00:35:22.358 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:90%
else in the universe.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
it so precious.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why souls
line up to come here.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:10%
Our friend Dannion
Brinkley has said

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:10%
there's probably as many as--

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:10%
there's billions of
souls that are lined up

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:10%
trying to get into
one of these bodies.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That makes us very special.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
all good souls?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Maybe, maybe not.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, maybe not.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Lourdes-- there
was a story, of course,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:90%
in France, of Bernadette.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.450 align:middle line:90%
An incredible story.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Very young girl.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.840 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.930 align:middle line:84%
- Many people who are
sick come to Lourdes, even

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:90%
the physically healthy.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has something to heal.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:84%
- Hardly had I taken
off my first stocking

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:84%
when I heard a noise as
if a sudden wind blew.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I turned my head and
looked at the meadow,

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that the
trees were still.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I went on taking
off my stocking,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and again, I heard
the same sound.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.680 align:middle line:84%
As I lifted up my head
to look at the grotto,

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I saw a lady dressed in white.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:10%
She wore a white dress,
an equally white veil,

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:10%
a blue belt, and a
yellow rose on each foot.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:84%
- Above the right side of
the cave, surrounded by ivy,

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
is a crevice.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette sees a
young woman there.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
Bernadette was describing

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:53.096 align:middle line:84%
was a visualization of
the blessed Virgin Mary.

00:36:53.096 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: In her light body.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In her light body.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Mary was the
first Christian to ascend.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Jesus ascended into
his Resurrection body

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and transmitted the vibration
of it to the Virgin Mary.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And what Bernadette--
my belief, my research

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.364 align:middle line:84%
shows that what
Mary manifested--

00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:84%
when she manifested
to Bernadette,

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.072 align:middle line:90%
she was in her light body form.

00:37:13.072 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Once these beings
achieve this ascension,

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:84%
they can pop into our
realm, and they often

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:84%
appear as these
bright white beings

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of light, the lady in white.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did people believe
Bernadette at the time?

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yes, they
did, matter of fact.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the Vatican came in
and validated her experience.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And now millions of people
go to Lourdes every year.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.200 align:middle line:84%
My wife Clare and I
lead tours to Lourdes.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Clare went there--

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got healing
properties, doesn't it?

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Clare, my wife, went there
10 years ago in a wheelchair

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:90%
and came out walking.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.029 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And this is
recorded over and over again.

00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why,
George-- and this

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.653 align:middle line:84%
is why we're so intrigued
about going to Lourdes--

00:37:45.653 --> 00:37:48.544 align:middle line:84%
is because what the Tibetans
teach, and others, tell

00:37:48.544 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:84%
us is that in their
ascended form,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:84%
these light beings can infuse
whole areas like Lourdes

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:90%
with this healing vibration.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you heal
the body, but you

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:84%
can raise its
frequency, and even

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
tap into the frequency
of the light body.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something in the water?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that was part of
the story of Bernadette,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is that Mary manifested this
spring where there was none,

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and it became a gusher
of this healing water.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And now people go to be
baptized in this water.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The same thing was
supposed to have happened

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:84%
at the baptism of Jesus,
where the divine spirit,

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit, infused
the River Jordan,

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and then that frequency spread
out from the River Jordan

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:84%
into all the rivers and
oceans of the Earth.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of people go there.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Millions of people go there.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.748 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Millions every year.

00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:10%
It's the third most
popular destination

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:10%
in the world every year.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are most people
cured from their illnesses

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:10%
and ailments?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.718 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I don't know
what the number is,

00:38:41.718 --> 00:38:43.835 align:middle line:84%
but the testimonials
are dramatic.

00:38:43.835 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, even if
one got cured it's a miracle.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's so exciting.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a placebo of the
power of human consciousness,

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:90%
the collective--

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to ask you that.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.091 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, you go to Lourdes
and it's so beautiful there.

00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
You're in the backdrop
of the Pyrenees,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's a spectacular place
to visit in and of itself.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But then you add
this layer of Mary

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
infusing it with the
frequency of the light body,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:84%
putting in this healing
frequency and more.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
multiple bandwidths

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that she's
broadcasting on there,

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
or infused the land with,
that you can tap into.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect, to some
people who may not know,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:84%
is where you basically
give somebody

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.310 align:middle line:84%
a sugar pill in a
test study, where

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
actual medicine,

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:90%
but they think they do.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:90%
They're not sure.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And they still get cured.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's ability
to take care of itself.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, it's power
of belief, mind over matter,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's foundational
to the work

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that Clare and I did here on
Gaia in our TV show, our show

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Arcanum, showing all this
artwork where the belief is

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that just by looking
at this painting,

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
your brain is linking with
these ascended beings,

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.642 align:middle line:90%
and you're tapping into it.

00:39:55.642 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
amazing how it works.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's beautiful,
the power of the mind

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate and suggest.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, exactly.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are we
headed with all this

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:90%
as a human species?

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, we're headed to--

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
a term they use is
singularity, a moment

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:84%
where it rapidly
accelerates and then it

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:84%
flips into something that's
incomprehensible to us right

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have so
much turmoil in our world

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.100 align:middle line:84%
right now, because we're
racing to this moment, which

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:90%
is less than--

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe less
than 10 years away.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I think 2020 is the next
real milestone where

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.020 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see even more
dramatic positive change.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see a planet
of non-wars, non-conflicts?

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Or will this continue?

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I hope so.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the powers
that be certainly

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.304 align:middle line:90%
are heavily invested in war.

00:40:45.304 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
They make so much
money off of it.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And what the people
have to do is find a way

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.760 align:middle line:90%
to demilitarize the planet.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this movement
is about in the spiritual area,

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:84%
where people are
doing their yoga

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and meditation to flip the
consciousness of the planet.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that power
is more powerful than even

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the best technique

00:41:05.668 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
for people to get into
this ascension mode?

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, the
best technique is to--

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to put three
words in their vocabulary.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
It's an easy place to start.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Say yes to our positive
potential, our ascension.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Start using the word love more.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Love yourself, love one another.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And the word victory
is very powerful.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And to lock on to
what is victory

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
for me as an individual
and victory for us

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.790 align:middle line:90%
as the human species?

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At least you didn't say
things like, I want or give me.

00:41:37.215 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
giving type thing.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's all about giving.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly, because you
can't take it with you.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about little children?

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Are they born with this?

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about my little
granddaughter and how magical

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.120 align:middle line:90%
she seems to be.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody taught her anything.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:90%
She just had it.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right,
she's a little guru.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.470 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, I spend a
lot of time these days,

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.310 align:middle line:84%
George, in airports and
out in public just looking

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes of babies.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And I see so much hope.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.340 align:middle line:84%
You always see hope
in the eyes of a baby.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But I look at them
and I think, golly,

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:84%
do we really want to
turn you into a cyborg?

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:10%
Did you come into this
planet at this time

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:10%
to be turned into a machine?

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:10%
And the answer that I get is no.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So that means that these
souls, these beings,

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:10%
your grandchildren and
all the other young ones

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.970 align:middle line:10%
are here for a very
special purpose.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
we have to do is

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.740 align:middle line:84%
try to help them to access
that and develop that.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
instantly wave a magic wand

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
around this planet,
what would you be doing?

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%
What would you be asking for?

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Oh, well,
of course, it would

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:90%
have to start with more love.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And just to let individuals
live and let live.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Just let people be.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:10%
Don't try to have to enforce
your ideas or your opinions

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:10%
on them.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:10%
Just let everybody
develop themselves

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.594 align:middle line:10%
as they're meant to be.

00:42:58.594 --> 00:43:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: William, thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: My pleasure, George.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And more
importantly, if people

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
need to get a hold of
you, give us your website.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.626 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: My website
is williamhenry.net.

00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
continue giving people

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:84%
the answers to that thing
that's missing, sometimes,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:90%
within each other.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
sense of wholeness.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.266 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're all going
for, that missing piece.

00:43:17.266 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's been a great
guest for us for so many years.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:90%
You can watch him on Gaia TV.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
listen to some of the things

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:84%
that he's told us
today about how

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
we can ascend, how
we can become better

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:84%
human beings in an environment,
in a world that needs it

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:90%
more now than ever before.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.566 align:middle line:90%
