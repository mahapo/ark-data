00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES KEENAN: I
try to tackle this

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.870 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific
perspective, but you

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.107 align:middle line:84%
can't deny what you come across
that just is unexplainable.

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Strange things happen?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.732 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Strange things.

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had a manual
magnetometer get fried,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and nobody wants to
admit that we're wrong.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.438 align:middle line:84%
History is wrong, and it
needs to be corrected.

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we looking at here?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: This was underground
into the cavern systems,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and what it looks like is
there was a location that was

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:90%
origin--

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a spaceship.

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It does.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The zoomorphic figures,
which are the animals

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:90%
seem to be mesmerized by it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to portals, that's
one of my goals in research

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:90%
is to try to locate these.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make sure you
come back, would you?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: I will.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.103 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
is high amounts of iridium.

00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
very sought after.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: And it's very
sought after, exactly.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing about this
one is look what's behind me.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.653 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:10%
Mystery Investigator
James Keenan's work

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:10%
has led him into
unexplainable events

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient and
lost history, and he

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:10%
loves doing what he's doing.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in this, James?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks for having me.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate being here.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: My pleasure.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.673 align:middle line:10%
>>KEENAN: So originally
I was in law enforcement,

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:10%
private investigation.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: And after
that, I decided

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that my background from
college was in anthropology

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and archeology, so I
wanted to merge the two

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.545 align:middle line:90%
things that I enjoy.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.413 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Thank you.

00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And delve into ancient
lost history, things

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're told isn't
supposed to have existed

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't exist or
that were incorrect.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at
what was being taught,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:10%
there were just
portions of it that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:10%
didn't seem right, that
seemed out of place.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And then it's always
constantly being regurgitated,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the same information, and nobody
wants to break away from that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
or admit that there is other
possibilities or the potential

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're wrong and
that the history is wrong

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and it needs to be corrected.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far back do you go?

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So I go as
far back as necessary.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, my credentials
were in Mesoamerican history

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:90%
and Mesoamerican anthropology.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But I saw that there was
a connection between North

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
America, specifically the desert
Southwest area in Mesoamerica.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking-- some of
this going past the last Ice

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Age, in other portions of
it right after we came out

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Ice Age, that
have been hidden

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it be purposely or from
just a loss of information.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've looked
at the special basin.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Uinta?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yes.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.423 align:middle line:84%
The Uinta Basin in
Northeastern, Utah.

00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this place.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sure.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's strange phenomena
that exists on the Uinta Basin

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and in the Uinta mountains.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, you
have two locations there

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that have high paranormal
or unexplainable activity.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:84%
One of them being
Skinwalker Ranch.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
We know all about
Skinwalker Ranch.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: All about that.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then just North
of Skinwalker Ranch,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:84%
you have Blind Frog Ranch
as well, which has--

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blind Frog?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Blind Frog Ranch.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they come
up with that name, right?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So the owner, when he
was originally drilling,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
he was looking for hidden
treasure, some of this

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:90%
being the Aztecs treasure.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
He brought the
drill bit back up,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and there were a
ton of blind frogs

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.068 align:middle line:90%
that came up out of the hole.

00:03:57.068 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally blind frogs?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Blind frogs.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And meaning that there was an
ecosystem underground where

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
these frogs were
capable of living that

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't require their need
to have visual capabilities,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
but that showed that there's
these underground cavity

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
systems below.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you look
at these images of the basin,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, what made you
go there in the first place?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sure.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So originally, it was the
petroglyphs and the pictographs

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that were in the area,
because we have these desert

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
archaic cultures that we don't
really know who they were.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We named them barrier Canyon
style and Fremont culture,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
just based upon locations
where we found artifacts.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We tie that into the
petroglyphs and the pictographs.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here Jim?

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So here, this
was just last year,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
we actually went underground
into the cavern systems

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that are below the Uinta
mountains and the basin.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
major connectivity that

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
goes 20 to 25 miles east-west
and then north-south that

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
has tons of underwater
stumps which

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
would be an underground lake,
underground rivers and swamps.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you fit
under that literally?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Could you slide under there?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.915 align:middle line:90%
Seems it's too close.

00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:19.715 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: No.

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I could fit under
there, and then

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that water just continues
for an unknown amount

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:90%
of time or length.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, this one here that
we're going to look at.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So, yeah, this is
new technology that I've been

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
adding recently to my
boots-on-the-ground

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:90%
investigation.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:90%
This is 3D ground imaging.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: What it is is it's
a gradiometer to magnetometers

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that take magnetic information
at specific locations

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and it converts
that vector and that flux

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to software, and
the software then

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.752 align:middle line:84%
brings out the information
that's below ground.

00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there a
different color scheme there?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's non-invasive.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go into the ground.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The red shows that there are
some type of metal objects

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
below ground.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
That one at 3.87 meters is
a little bit past 12 feet.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And the blue show that there are
voids or other type of cavities

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:90%
below ground.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And it allows me to see
before having to dig or even

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was
a necessity to dig.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And here there was
obviously a lot

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of things that need to
be additionally looked at

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and researched at a later date.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That bottom image
looks like an alien gray

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:90%
with a hoodie on.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.185 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It's possible.

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you do
these investigations,

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:90%
what are you looking for?

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sure.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So I've always noticed that we
have all this historical data

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and information, and
people look into it.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be looking at
the same information in history

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that's been there.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.635 align:middle line:90%
So I've--

00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:14.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over and over.

00:07:14.445 --> 00:07:15.445 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Over and over.

00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just regurgitated.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to figure out
a way to go past that.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was
I've incorporated

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
more recent technology
into the investigation.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if I bring
not just ground

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
penetrating radar but 3D
ground imaging, different types

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
of radar, it allows us to
collect these new data points

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and show that maybe some of
this unexplainable phenomena

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is really due to
certain types of energy,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
be it magnetic energy or
electromagnetic field energy.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And my sense of
understanding is maybe

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking
at the phenomena

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
as we're never going
to find out what it is

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
or how it functions, maybe if
we're able to see the science

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
part of it, that might explain
that the phenomena is either

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
creating what we're seeing,
this unexplainable phenomena,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
or is the unexplainable
phenomena attracted

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
to that energy that's there?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we collect
enough data points,

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to zero in more on
what's happening, because it's

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
obviously transient,
which is very

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
unique and different
that it's moving.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that
it's underground,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and whether it be natural
or man made or other

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
made, is something that will
be able to eventually locate

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and then determine.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And then once we do that,
we're able to determine

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's creating the
other phenomena above ground

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or how it's affecting
certain types of people.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talk about mysteries,
Ancient Civilizations

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia looked at the
discoveries regarding that Utah

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
area you're talking
about to see if there was

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
a connection between
Atlantis, the Aztecs,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and other strange mysteries.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:10%
>> ANDREW COLLINS:
The Mexica, or Aztecs,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:10%
have various traditions about
their point of origin and about

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.325 align:middle line:10%
the timing of this event.

00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Some of them have
no dates at all

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:10%
and probably go back many,
many thousands of years

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.988 align:middle line:10%
arguably even to the time of
Atlantis 11,500 years ago.

00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> FREDDY SILVA: If you go
back about 11,000 years ago,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a time
of an enormous flood suddenly

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed the Earth,
huge catastrophe.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a-- fire came out in
the sky, parts of a meteorite

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
crashed upon the Earth, and
this changed the whole structure

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth as
we know it today.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a huge
story of multiple nations

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:10%
who survived, in small
numbers, this huge catastrophe

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:10%
11,000 years ago and
then populated the tribes

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:10%
that we know today.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:10%
So the Anasazi, the Hopi,
the Navajo, the Aztec,

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:10%
who then became the Mexica,
all of these peoples

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:10%
are little crumbs
of original people

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:10%
that survived a very
ancient catastrophe.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Could a cataclysm 11,000
years ago have spurred

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.080 align:middle line:84%
a migration of mass proportions
that separated these tribes

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
into different areas?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The Legend of the
Aztecs suggests

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that their people began their
journey from a red Canyon

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:90%
with four rivers.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Cecilio Orozco of California
State University, Fresno,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:10%
set out to confirm the
actual location of Aztlan.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
On March 24, 1990,
Dr. Orozco published

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:90%
an astonishing conclusion.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:84%
By cross-referencing the
description of the land where

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
the Mohica came from, Orozco was
able to pinpoint the location

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:90%
of their homeland, Utah.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:84%
More specifically,
the Four Corners

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
region where the borders
of Utah, Arizona, Colorado,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and New Mexico all converge.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so unique,
James, about that area,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:90%
that region?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So in Utah,
and I tend to push it up

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:84%
a little further into
Northeastern Utah,

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
we have this
location that ties in

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
not just to Mesoamerica
but to the archaic desert

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
cultures that were here.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And what it looks like is
there was a location that

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
was origin for a lot of these
cultures and civilizations,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
meaning there was some
type of catastrophic event

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:90%
that occurred.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And they took refuge--

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or a certain group
and amount of people

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
took refuge there in Utah.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
names for this.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of the local
Utah territory,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Indians would call
it [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But [NON-ENGLISH] is really
ancient Gaelic and ancient

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew, and it's [NON-ENGLISH].

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
how that occurs.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you have,
in Mesoamerica,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they called it
[NON-ENGLISH],, or Aztlan.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
find all this out?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So there's multiple
things that I looked at.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
One of those was
oral traditions.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I went through the Nahua
which are in Mexico,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of their
oral traditions

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
were similar to the Shoshone,
which were the Utah territory

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Indians and the Paiute.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And what people fail to realize
is the Ute Indians weren't

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
really from Utah, they
were more from Colorado

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.272 align:middle line:90%
and from New Mexico.

00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's quite a spot.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It is.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But their oral traditions
are all very similar.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They just call this origin
point something different.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
the fact that they all

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:84%
speak a similar language,
whether it be Numic or Nahuatl,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%
it's all Uto-Aztecan.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that there's
all this similarity

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
from such different geographic
areas and their stories

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
all point to what seems to
be in Utah as a place where

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
they escaped this
catastrophic event.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And in that area, in
Northeastern Utah,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.283 align:middle line:84%
it tends to point towards
a meteor or large asteroid.

00:13:27.283 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smacked right down.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.908 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Smacked
right down there.

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have all this
magnetic and electromagnetic

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.635 align:middle line:90%
anomalies occurring underground.

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:34.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks
for understanding.

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
You may be right there.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
Skinwalker Ranch and Blind Frog

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Ranch.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
What are the parallels
between those?

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sure.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So they both have this
unexplained phenomena probably

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in the number one is UAP, this
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:90%
that's occurring.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
They've seen a lot of objects in
the air above Skinwalker Ranch.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The owner of Blind
Frog Ranch has

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:84%
stated that he has
seen nine UFOs appear

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
in some type of cloud cloaking
devices above Blind Frog Ranch.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
You also have this
energy, whether it

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
be directed energy weapon
or just directed energy

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
affecting certain people.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And for some, it's
a negative aspect

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that it's occurring to them.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's never positive?

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It seems to
rarely be positive.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:90%
It's almost always negative.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have these
disconnect voices or some type

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence that seems to be
a little bit greater than what

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
we are at or where we're at
interacting with individuals

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:90%
on both ranches.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So it just seems to be-- and
then you also have the cattle

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:90%
mutilations too--

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: --that look to be
occurring at both locations

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and even on other areas
of the Uinta Basin.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many
people think they're

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:90%
ET related cattle mutilations.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: I've heard
that there could

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
be a possible relationship
between the two,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and they do look at that.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at some slides,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell
us what these are.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:17.232 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So this is a natural
marker on Blind Frog Ranch.

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was carved out.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.107 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It was
carved out, absolutely.

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You see it's too symmetrical
to have been natural.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
is it points directly

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.202 align:middle line:10%
towards a hidden
cave that we located.

00:15:30.202 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like a marker?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:10%
>>KEENAN: Like a marker.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:10%
So it's pointing
directly to a cave

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to research
further here in the coming

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.627 align:middle line:10%
summer.

00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our next image.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Somebody on his phone.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So what you got here
is I am at Blind Frog Ranch.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's
approximately 2 miles

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
of underground cavern
system where I'm at.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm using 3D ground
imaging right

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
now to detect what locations
those are and what direction

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.287 align:middle line:90%
that they're traveling.

00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
standing in front of, James?

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: So that was a--

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
initially before they
had dug straight down,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
they dug horizontally
into that hillside.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So they've covered up the
mine shaft area cavern

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:90%
that they created.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But they realized that
you couldn't get in there

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
by going horizontal.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
We had to go vertical
to get to it.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely
inundated with water.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Did you do you feel any
kind of special energy when

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
you're out there or
anything like that?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: So absolutely.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
There's certain energy zones
that are located on Blind Frog

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Ranch, and there's
an energy that you

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
can feel almost anywhere when
you're on Skinwalker Ranch.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it seems or I guess
you would say feels benevolent,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:90%
other times malevolent, and--

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:90%
On skin-- excuse me.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.171 align:middle line:84%
On Blind Frog Ranch,
actually they have a location

00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:05.129 align:middle line:90%
and they call the pond.

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So something's
looming over that place?

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: There's
a good possibility

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:90%
that there's something there.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some caves
and portals at Blind Frog

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Ranch.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:10%
Take a look.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We believe, and there's a
lot of evidence about that,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:10%
both from recent humans, that
caves were conceived as portals

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:10%
as gates to the underworld.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:10%
They conceived the underworld
as a world of prosperity

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:10%
or as the place of
origin of all things.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:10%
We believe, in their
opinion, the end of the cave

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:10%
was the connection
to the netherworld,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:10%
and they wanted to get
this connection in order

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:10%
to communicate and maintain
their relationships

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:10%
with the entities which are at
the other side of the world.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Animals and geometric
signs are the primary subjects

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:10%
of most of these paintings,
which were executed with

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:10%
an amazing level of artistic
ability, especially,

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:10%
considering the
time and conditions.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:10%
>> While going through art
and state of consciousness,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:10%
they saw the animals
within their vision,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:10%
and then they painted
them on the wall.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:10%
They then went there in
order to see animals.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:10%
They went there in order to
get attached to the cosmos.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And via that, they saw
things within the region

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and they put them on the wall.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Andrew Collins, an ancient
history researcher and writer

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:10%
on the significance
of this study.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: The greatest
takeaway, in my opinion,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:10%
relating to this study is not so
much the fact that they come up

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:10%
with this idea, which is
revolutionary in itself,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:10%
but it's the fact that
academics are seriously

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:10%
considering the idea
that we are communicating

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:10%
with non-human intelligences.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And that these entities, these
beings may well have been real.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to
try and understand

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%
exactly what those entities are.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What it shows
you is there are people

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
out there trying to get those
answers you're looking for.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Absolutely.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to portals, that's
one of my goals in research,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.937 align:middle line:90%
is to try to locate these--

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make sure you
come back, would you?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: I will.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of
people don't realize

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is the magnetic
energy that we have

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
available in certain locations,
many times, are high.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a possibility
that we have these electron

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:84%
diffusion regions here in
the , not just out in space.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
magnetic energy that's

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:84%
capable of being converted
into charged particle energy

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
by heat and kinetic energy
being forced through a smaller

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
location, which would
be considered a portal.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So when we charge this
energy and it opens up,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:84%
it would be something that
we would be considering

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:90%
as a vortex or a portal.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And I firmly believe
that the science is there

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:90%
to show that this can occur.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just there are certain
locations around our planet.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Northeastern Utah seems to
be one of the prime examples

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:90%
where this energy exists.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it just happens?

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It just happens.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:10%
And I think we've discussed it
slightly earlier that I believe

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:10%
there was some type of
meteor or asteroid impact

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:10%
that brought certain
types of material

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:10%
to the location that helps
create more of this energy.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And you see, you see a
lot higher mineralization

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that's taken place in the
Uinta mountains and the basin,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
including high amounts of gold,
and what's really interesting

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is high amounts of
iridium, which is rare

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.363 align:middle line:90%
unless there was a meteor or--

00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
very sought after.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: And it's
very sought after.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who did
the petroglyphs?

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So the petroglyphs
and the pictographs

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in that area where the desert
archaic people, the Barrier

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Canyon style and the Fremont.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.485 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting and unique.

00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are those carved?

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.003 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Those are petroglyphs.

00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
They've been carved into the
rock art or the rock wall.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.865 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
is what's missing in them.

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old do you
think that is, James?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: I think
this is probably

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.932 align:middle line:84%
anywhere between 2,000 to 8,000
years old, this specific one.

00:21:30.932 --> 00:21:33.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what is
that object on the left?

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Absolutely.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So remember that when
you're talking about--

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks
like a spaceship.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It does.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything is subjective.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at it and you think

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
about it in our current
viewpoints that we're aware of,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
it looks like some
type of technology

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:90%
that looks to have landed.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
It looks to be
beaming out something

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
there looks to be some type
of anthropomorphic figure

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that is coming down
from it, meeting up

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
with another
anthropomorphic figure

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and the zoomorphic figures,
which are the animals,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
seem to be mesmerized by
it not quite understanding

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:90%
what's occurring.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that look
like somebody named Steve?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: And you get the
vandalism unfortunately

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
all throughout no matter
where that takes place.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do we
know the vandalism didn't

00:22:16.853 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:90%
do everything?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Based
upon whether there's

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ways to look at--
you can look at the patina,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
you can look at
the other rock art.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
You want to look at it all,
what you see in the area,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.578 align:middle line:90%
not just small amounts of it.

00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:30.378 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:30.378 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And where are you here?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Here we're
at Dry Fork Canyon,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:90%
just outside of Vernal, Utah.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the most amazing sets

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of petroglyphs that were
done by the Fremont culture,

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
probably anywhere
between 0 and 1,200 AD.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing about this
one is, look what's behind me.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's gorgeous.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It's
representing what I believe

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to be one of the giants.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It has six digits on its
hands and super large feet.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one
right behind you?

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.508 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Well,
they're all giants,

00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
but that one specific
one looks like giant.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to match what the
neuralgic culture in Sardinia

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.715 align:middle line:90%
showed for their giant.

00:23:17.715 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got a sword
in his hand or something?

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: He has a specific
type of weapon and a spear.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The helmet and his
tunic seem to match

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:84%
what you see that was put
out by the neuralgic culture

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and Sardinia.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that coming
out of his side of his head?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So that looks
to be some type of helmet

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.110 align:middle line:90%
that they wore up on top.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Also, you see that there seems
to be that they were head

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
hunting, so they have other
indigenous peoples' heads that

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
they're carrying, which may
have been why some of the local

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
tribes considered,
like the Si-Te-Cah,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
which were the redhead
cannibal giants,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's where
cannibal came from,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
was due to the fact that
they were head hunters.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they particularly
enlightened people?

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: They
look to have been--

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
they look to have been
maybe pre-human or humankind

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:84%
where we're currently
at, current mankind.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were a
little bit ahead of us.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we had this bleed
over where we were with them.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is you have

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
certain groups of the giants
like the Starnake, which we're

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
told were mining giants
in that area that

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:90%
used tools that made sound.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that tells
me that they had

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
pneumatic or hydraulic
or electric power

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:90%
that they were using for that.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
You also have the
Si-Te-Cah, which were

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:90%
the red-haired cannibal giants.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
In Mesoamerica, you have the
Uemas and the Quinametzin.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But what you see is
you see a reduction

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in height taking place
as it gets closer

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to our current time, because
the Native Americans say,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and even the Spaniards came
across these redheaded giants

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
all the way until the middle
1800s in Nevada and Utah.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So what that's telling
me is at some point,

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
it looks like in
order to survive,

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
they had to mate
with Homo sapien,

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and that was where that
reduction in height

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:90%
started to occur.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like a
biblical story, doesn't it?

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.058 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It absolutely does.

00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:23.543 align:middle line:90%
It sure matches.

00:25:23.543 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
other phenomena

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:90%
is in this basin area?

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, you're getting this
interaction with technology.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be able to do
weird things with technology,

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
whether that be
drainage of batteries

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:90%
or destroying the technology.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.928 align:middle line:90%
I've had a manual--

00:25:42.928 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange things happen.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.262 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Strange things.

00:25:45.262 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I've had a manual magnetometer
get fried on Blind Frog Ranch,

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and that shouldn't
occur, because it isn't

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
using computers or software.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it just happens.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It just
happened, exactly.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have drones
that there's never

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
been any issues anywhere
else where they've been used,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
fly right into the
wall, because it's

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.568 align:middle line:84%
lost all power with
the Wi-Fi connection

00:26:11.568 --> 00:26:13.485 align:middle line:84%
and it just doesn't know
what to do but crash.

00:26:13.485 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:90%
You talked about portals.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's program, Deep Space,
they discussed this region.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's an ancient
presence in that area just like

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Shasta, and that the
sacred mountain of the East was

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:84%
a gathering place where all
the Native peoples they did not

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
fight, and the bloodless
valley was the San Luis Valley

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
for the Native peoples.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was because there
was an ancient connection

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
between these
interstellar civilizations

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and early Native American
people of that area.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's still that energy
that presence is still there.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> As a result of the location,
it's the only area in North

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
America where 3 regional
groups of Indians overlapped.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It's very interesting.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.262 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
How do you pick
your spots to go to?

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So what
I do is I'll run

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.045 align:middle line:84%
a deep historical
background on the location.

00:27:07.045 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before
you go out there?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.753 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Before I go out there.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to see exactly,
from an anthropological and

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:84%
archaeological standpoint,
what the data shows.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Then I want to look at it
from just a layman's terms.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're like,
it just doesn't make sense.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So I want to run a deep
history into the distant past

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and gather all that information,
not just from artifacts, not

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
just from petroglyphs
and pictographs,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
but from probably one of
the most important ways

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of receiving that,
which is oral tradition

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous
people that were here.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
out there James,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
do you have that oh wow factor?

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: All the time.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I figured that.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Sometimes
I try to tackle this

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific perspective
as much as I possibly can,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:90%
but there is just no way.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So sometimes
you can't do that?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.567 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: You can't do that.

00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't deny what
you come across

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:90%
that just is unexplainable.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like to use
the word paranormal.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to use unexplainable
because that's what it is.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love supernatural.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: That too.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you come
across this energy

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
that you feel like it's
interacting with you

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
what to do about it.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And those are what
I'm looking for.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
If I can put the data
points into technology

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to what I'm feeling or what
other people have experienced

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and show that, hey, this is the
possibility that the two are

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:84%
merging, that science
and the unknown

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
can really just be something
that, soon in the future,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:90%
we'll find out what that is.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not a puzzle
that's unsolvable.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It can be solved with the
technology we have today.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you heard
of David Paulides?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Absolutely.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: 411.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 411 books.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Missing people in regions
like this where people

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
are walking with somebody, they
turn around, the person's gone.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You might be able
to explain that?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sure.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So again, these are those
electron diffusion regions.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are certain
areas in this planet where

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
the energy can be converted.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And other intelligences
know how to do that.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:84%
They may be here just
at a different dimension

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or a different reality,
and they understand

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that connectivity between where
they are and where we are.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.665 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Americans
believe it or not--

00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh they are on it.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Yeah,
through their dance,

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:84%
through their use of altering
vibration and frequency

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.258 align:middle line:84%
with drums and with
certain reed instrument.

00:29:55.258 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sound resonance.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.383 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sound resonance.

00:29:57.383 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to create the
technology that we're just now

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:90%
discovering through science.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we lose this
information, this knowledge?

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
question, and it had

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:84%
to be through some type
of catastrophic event.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something severed it?

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Severed
it, and then people

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that are in control
of certain information

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
don't want to share that,
and it's understandable

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
when you see what they're trying
to accomplish through that.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, because I can
see things from my grandfather,

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother told my mother
something, she told me,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I told my kids.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It passes down over the
years, tens and tens of years.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But if something were
to happen to one of us

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and that knowledge would
to stop right there,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't pick up on it
until somebody stumbled into it.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's happening here.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: I agree 100%.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And think about, if we've
written something down,

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.673 align:middle line:84%
whether it be on old codicils
or parchment or books,

00:30:59.673 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
catastrophic event, what

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:90%
would happen to that?

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:90%
It would be destroyed.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly,
and gone forever.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: What would be the--

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
gone forever, but what
would be the only thing that

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
would survive?

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Would be the rock art.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
The petroglyphs
and the pictographs

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
have a better chance
of survival based

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
upon what it's the medium
that's being used along

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:90%
with oral tradition.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But even oral tradition
gets watered down

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.692 align:middle line:84%
or things are incorrectly
told over time.

00:31:23.692 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you've been
out there in these regions,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:90%
have you felt anything strange?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Many times.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Probably when I'm
on Skinwalker Ranch,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.203 align:middle line:84%
you cannot say that you don't
feel something occurring there.

00:31:38.203 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
very strange there.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Something
is very strange there.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I 100% believe
my hypothesis is

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's below ground,
whatever this is,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that energy is below ground.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be able
to see it or record it

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.142 align:middle line:90%
with instruments?

00:31:53.142 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: I believe so.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I think with the
magnetometers, I'm

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:84%
recording the
magnetic differences.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I can follow
that magnetic trail

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and then convert that
to 3D ground imaging,

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to
give locations where

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.565 align:middle line:84%
we can dig or match
up known entrances,

00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and then we would just
have to go underground

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.015 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully there's
connectivity, because there's

00:32:17.015 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes and other
things that could

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:90%
have severed that in the past.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
I believe that we'll

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:84%
be able to get to what the
causes that are affecting us.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's assume you
stumbled into a portal, James,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.228 align:middle line:90%
what do you see?

00:32:35.228 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: It's a good question.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all speculation.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I mean, do you see
the other side of the mountain?

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you see a different area?

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a different city?

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.512 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know
how to answer that.

00:32:50.512 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
on another planet?

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Are you
on another planet?

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The one thing too that we need
to take into consideration

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:84%
as people talk about all
these different dimensions.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
With me being a three
dimensional character

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:84%
were to walk into
a fourth dimension,

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:90%
would I really exist there?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:84%
What would my abilities
using our five senses be?

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Would I be able to actually
use them wherever that is?

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's a limitation
that at some point, hopefully

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to
further look into.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That map
we saw of those four

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
corners of that region,
these areas of Utah and New

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Mexico and all these
places, is there something

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:90%
special about this location?

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Oh, yeah.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You're on the reservation,
you have this ancient history,

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:84%
you have these sites like
Dulce, New Mexico where they

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.723 align:middle line:90%
state there is UFO phenomena--

00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: --all the time.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sedona.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sedona, absolutely.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about
tons of different cultures

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations coming
together in one area,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:84%
but there's so many
similarities why

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is that unless the same
phenomenon is occurring.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
these portals exist?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: I 100% believe
portals exist, yes.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't see them?

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.925 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: I haven't
seen them yet.

00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
could stumble into it.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And Gaia's Deep Space discuss
these portals in this four

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.740 align:middle line:90%
corners region.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to get your
reaction to this.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: OK.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Portals are actually
different areas.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They're also
described as vortexes.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of the portals that
we've gone to examine

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
are all in places that the
Indigenous people hold sacred.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:84%
There's always an oral history
in those indigenous tribes

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:90%
of strange happenings going on.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We believe that what's
causing the portals, which

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:84%
are a tear in the electric
membrane that separates

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.199 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, are
vast quartz crystal

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.360 align:middle line:84%
deposits underneath
the topography,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that these deposits actually
generate electromagnetic fields

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:84%
so strong that they can
cause a momentary rip

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
or tear in that membrane.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:84%
When you get that
tear occurring,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:84%
you have momentary
interaction between dimensions

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and we describe that
as being paranormal.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have is
a scenario by which there

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.410 align:middle line:84%
are areas like this where
the fields being generated

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
are so powerful
that they're causing

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
this non-stop interaction
with another dimension,

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing
that can explain

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
the wide array of paranormal
activity taking place

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
these fields exist,

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because they exist in a
very small geographic area

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Now today, it's almost like the
military is slowly buying up

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:84%
these areas where
these portals exist,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're placing a guard
at the door of each one.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that true?

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: I believe so.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they doing?

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It's interesting,
and they said it too.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're changing magnetic
energy into charged particle

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
energy that creates
these portals,

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:84%
it has to happen through
an electromagnetic field.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
this is occurring.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:84%
NASA's right now looking
at that above the Earth

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:90%
at these x points.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They have for satellites
that are doing that.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.405 align:middle line:84%
So if this can occur between
the sun and the Earth,

00:36:17.405 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:84%
we know there's a 93
million mile long portal,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:90%
why could it not occur here?

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And the Native Americans--

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
could be everywhere?

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: It could
be everywhere.

00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Americans
have been around

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and have kept their history for
so much longer than we have,

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that they know
where these exist,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
where this energy is
available to do this.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's on those lands
and, sure enough, it

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.520 align:middle line:84%
seems like the government
is taking more and more

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
away from us, making it
more difficult for me

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go out there
and investigate boots

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it when it's--

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Several
hundred thousand people

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:84%
disappear on this
planet every year.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:90%
They vanished.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where they are.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them
maybe were murdered

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
but not all of them.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable
these poor people

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:84%
are stumbling into these
portals and they can't get back?

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a possibility.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the Skinwalker
Ranch phenomena

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is what people say at
other areas they always

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
say it's a Skinwalker ranch
phenomena that's occurring.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've seen,
at other locations,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
them actually capture this
occurring on different imaging,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it be thermal
or infrared, meaning,

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:84%
it has to be in a different
radiation spectrum,

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the light spectrum is
different, and we're

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:90%
catching this occurring.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't have that
equipment or that ability,

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just using
our regular vision,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know it's there
in front of me and walk in,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and how would I get out
once I'm on the other side?

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there UFO reports
around these locations?

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Oh, yeah,
the Uinta Basin

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is considered part of UFO
alley, absolutely when

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.960 align:middle line:90%
something's going on.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
got to be a connection.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
There are no
coincidences, James.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: There's
no coincidences.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And you run this
area 335.00 degrees,

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and you have areas
like Los Alamos, Dulce.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.120 align:middle line:90%
You go--

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sedona.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Sedona.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
we detonated a nuclear bomb

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.992 align:middle line:84%
underground at this exact spot
in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe we
created a portal?

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Maybe we created
a portal or the energy that

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:84%
brought in the initial
group or something,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because after that 1945 date,
what started occurring all

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the time were all
these UFO sightings,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's up and down the same
UFO alley, which goes right

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:90%
through the Uinta Basin.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
many abduction cases

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: So I hear about
those, but it's not something

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that I'm tracking
currently right now.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking into.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might want to
look into that in future.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Maybe.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There could
be some correlation

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.260 align:middle line:90%
between some of them.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.885 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: There may
very well be there.

00:39:04.885 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about time travel?

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Yeah.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's another thing.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about these
vortexes or these portals,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe we're not going
to a different space,

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe we're going
to a different time.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:23.620 align:middle line:84%
If we're affecting space time,
we see, and here's my greatest

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:84%
example when I'm telling
people, on Skinwalker Ranch,

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
there have been
creatures that they

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.650 align:middle line:84%
have seen that look like
they were from the past.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
direwolves or things that

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:90%
would remind us that dinosaurs.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Should be extinct.

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Should be extinct what
other way could that possibly

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.677 align:middle line:84%
be unless time collapsed
on itself through a portal.

00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: Meaning the past
and the present came together.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And we follow these
creatures, we interact,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
they've shot these
creatures before,

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
seem to harm them.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
They seem to notice it, because
we're in the same space but not

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:90%
the same time.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And as it starts moving back
out into its space time,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:90%
it just suddenly disappears.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're occupying the same
space but not the same time.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So time travel could
absolutely be taking effect.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that
firsthand in multiple people,

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.150 align:middle line:84%
whether it had been BASS,
Bigelow Aerospace Advanced

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Space Studies, or NIDS,
the National Institute

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:90%
for Discovery Sciences.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which Bigelow
put together as well.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.057 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: He put
together as well.

00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And they recorded that.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Different groups
have recorded that.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:10%
And I've got firsthand knowledge
from some of those best team

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:10%
members of what they saw.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And where they saw it matches
up where my data points

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:90%
have been collected.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a 100% firm believer
that we may be looking at,

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:84%
not just space portals or
vortexes, but also time portals

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and vortexes.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: James, what's
your next project?

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>>KEENAN: I will be back
up on the Uinta Basin

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:10%
starting in June.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:10%
We're going to go
back to those markers,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:10%
we're going to go
underground, because I

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.452 align:middle line:10%
think the answers are--

00:41:06.452 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are deep down there.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: --deep down
there underground.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you'd be safe.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KEENAN: Thank you.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KEENAN: I
appreciate being here.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, George.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.148 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe we'll do a follow
up show with James Keenan,

00:41:16.148 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
unless he stumbles into a
portal and he doesn't come back,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.200 align:middle line:90%
you never know, but fascinating.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
