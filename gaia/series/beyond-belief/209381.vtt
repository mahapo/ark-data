>>MATTHEW LACROIX: The
true story of humanity

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is far more complex and
interesting than we're told.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Symbolism is really the
language of the ancient people.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:84%
There are really two distinctive
paths that we could take,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
which is what really the
serpent and the eagle represent.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with real eagles.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:84%
They represents this
flying above all,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
seeing all and conquering
all and attacking from above.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is the
very first symbol

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that is uniformly seen
all around Mesopotamia--

>>GEORGE NOORY:
All over the place?

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Symbolism was the way where you
could have a complex message.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Only those initiates who studied
it understand the symbolic

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
versus the literal
aspect of it would know

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:90%
what those symbols really mean.

edition of "Beyond Belief."

Matthew LaCroix is back with
us, a writer and researcher

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:10%
who specializes in Mesopotamian
history and megalithic

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:10%
civilizations.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of work, Matthew.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I'm great it's
awesome to be back talking

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:90%
to you again, George.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's truly an honor.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:14.615 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of topics?

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It was not
something that I planned for.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:10%
It was something that
was just some curiosity

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:10%
led me down that term,
rabbit hole, where

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:10%
you go deeper and deeper
into understanding

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:10%
ancient civilizations, how
the megalithic component plays

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:10%
into the different ages
of those civilizations--

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: And just the--

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.037 align:middle line:10%
I guess the passion of wanting
to know what the truth is.

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's then-- then here
we are after all these years

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:10%
later.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It became really the core of
what my real drive and passion

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:90%
is right now in life.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
Mesopotamian history?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: When we look
at around the world,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
the different civilizations--
the Fertile Crescent region,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that's discussed as the
birthplace of civilization

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and the first cities, the
Iraq-Syria area, up through--

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The cradle
of civilization?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Mesopotamian
area, like especially Iraq.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And because I specialize
in cuneiform tablets

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
from Sumerian,
Akkadian, and Babylonian

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that were in that
area, that's one of the reasons

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that I became so focused on
that particular area of study.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say
the Garden of Eden

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:90%
was slated right around there.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.353 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: This seems
like the story--

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
we can go back to the
very beginning, things

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
like the Atra-Hasis with this
creation of mankind coming

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
from this area that looks like I
think-- from what I've studied,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.728 align:middle line:84%
the Garden of Eden was likely
near the ancient city of Eridu,

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
which is something
that I'm also very

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.412 align:middle line:84%
passionate about
discussing as well.

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're really into
this ancient civilization

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
material, aren't you?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I can't
get enough of it.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I honestly-- it's
mind blowing when

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you talk to someone who's
not privy to this alternative

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
history aspect that we discuss,
and you actually tell them

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.612 align:middle line:84%
this true story based on tablets
and evidence around the world,

00:02:51.612 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, why wasn't
I taught that in school?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's
interesting about history--

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
teach this in school.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They don't.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the true
story of humanity

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
is far more complex and
interesting than we're told.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Symbols are
important too, aren't they?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Symbolism
is really the language

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient people.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they had languages.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Like the Sumerians had practiced
cuneiform Sumerian writing.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of leaving
behind a message that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
was shown around
the world, symbolism

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
was the way where you could
have a complex message

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
with multiple different
meanings and representations

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:90%
be shown in a civilization.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, only
those initiates who studied,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
understand the symbolic versus
the literal aspect of it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
would know what those
symbols really mean.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matthew,
tell us the symbol

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
of first of all, the serpent.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The serpent is, in
terms of looking at ancient

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, the very first
symbol that is uniformly seen

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:90%
all around Mesopotamia--

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the place?

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It really is a symbol that
then spread around the world

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and has close relations
to the dragon.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
one and the same,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and we can go into
that as we discuss it.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about the eagle?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.967 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And the
eagle was another one

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of these symbols that emerged
at the same time as the serpent.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to be
going along and discussing,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
it became a point
of contention where

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
they were really competing
against each other,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
because they really
represent almost

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of each other.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.191 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do these symbols
though tie into humanity?

00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The symbols
tie into humanity,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
because when we look
at something like,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:90%
what does a serpent represent?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the human
archetype of our energy field,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
our spinal cord with
the chakra energy

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
of reaching what is known as
the ancient Hindu understanding

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of Kundalini, reaching the
highest states of energy

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
we can, what happens
is if you were

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to look at that energy,
the spiral of energy

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
around the spinal cord,
it looks like a serpent.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.005 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's what our
energy field looks like.

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:43.645 align:middle line:90%
So it represents knowledge.

00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it was
shown around the world

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.097 align:middle line:84%
in civilizations that base
themselves on knowledge

00:04:48.097 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and reaching higher
states of consciousness.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't the symbol
for medicine also a serpent?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It is.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to have
to call an ambulance

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're driving down
the road and you see one go by,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice what is known
as the rod of asclepius,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.235 align:middle line:90%
which is on the side--

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.188 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: What's so strange
about that is that the serpent

00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
symbol became demonized
later and yet,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.715 align:middle line:84%
it's on some of our most
established medical industries.

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
this picture, Matthew.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're looking at.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.963 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the upper left.

00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking--

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Sure.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
a story that we're

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
going to get into as we go
along here, because it has

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
quite a background behind it.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's the flag of
Mexico, and really it

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.282 align:middle line:84%
is the heart to represent
in terms of what

00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be discussing.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:10%
Because what you see is
an eagle eating a serpent.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:90%
And as we go along, I want to--

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I can point out that
flag, the flag of Mexico

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
is not the original
flag of the Aztec.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It was
actually something

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
that was enacted by the
Spanish when they conquered,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
which again is the whole
purpose behind the symbol,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's showing you
that the eagle is conquering

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.903 align:middle line:90%
the serpent.

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the next
one there in the middle?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The next
one is the caduceus.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient Greek
and Egyptian symbol

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
known as the wings of Hermes.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It's also a show associated
with Thoth in Egypt.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And it basically represents
that spiral of energy

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
along the spinal cord
with wings of the top,

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and the wings
represent ascension

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.667 align:middle line:84%
to higher energy and higher
states of consciousness.

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one on the
far right, very similar.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.533 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's the
famous one that you'll

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
see on ambulances
in hospitals today.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
That's known as the
rod of asclepius.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And again, very similar
to the caduceus.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Instead of two
serpents, it's one.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And instead of wings
where you're actually

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:10%
seeing as a symbol--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:10%
without the wings represents
more of reaching good health.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bottom left?

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The bottom left
is the famous depiction

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of the Roman Aguila.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It represents the Roman Eagle,
which was so important to them

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:90%
that if they lost one of these--

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
they call them a Standards, if
they lost one of these eagles

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in battle, they would send
armies to retrieve them.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And often sometimes
losing hundreds, if not

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:90%
thousands of men.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
That was how important that was
to them in their civilization

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
empire.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one in
the middle of course?

00:06:57.438 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Everyone know.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the Great Seal of the
United States of America.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.032 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And as we
go along in discussing

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
what the eagle
really represents,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
people may have a different
perspective on seeing that.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bottom far right?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.522 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Bottom far right is
the World Health Organization.

00:07:11.522 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And as you can
see it once again,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
similar to the rod
of asclepius, you

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
have the symbol of the serpent
interwoven around the world,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
showing--

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
reaching higher states
of health in this case,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
but it can also
mean higher states

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.167 align:middle line:90%
of energy and consciousness.

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonny Enoch on Gaia's
"Mystery Teachings Special"

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
discusses symbolism of the
serpent around the world.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.598 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if that
matches what you've said.

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>>JONNY ENOCH: Probably
the most common symbolism

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:10%
we find all throughout the
mysteries is the serpent.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It is found all over
the world and represents

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:90%
different types of energy.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We find it in Asia
with the Naga,

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico with
Quetzalcoatl and Kukulkan.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, we find it on
the headdress of the king,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
protruding from
the pineal gland.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It's on the caduceus or the
medical symbol we use today

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:10%
on the side of your ambulance,
showing the serpents moving up

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:10%
the spine and awakening the
pineal and the two swan wings

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:10%
on either side or the
hemispheres of your brain,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:10%
representing the equilibrium.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is among
the oldest worship

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:90%
symbols venerated in the world.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Anthropologists have even
found caves in Africa

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that portrays serpent worship
going back 70,000 years.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
What we believe
is this tradition

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
comes from Atlantis,
as according

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to the Arab geographers the
mythical island, was often

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
referred to as Antilles
Island or the Dragon's Isle.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is symbolized as the
awakening of the spirit fire,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
immortality, and
regeneration within us.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:10%
It is also represented
on the cartouche

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian
Royalty or name titles.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
When it is facing inwards,
it means the initiate

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:90%
is seeking immortality.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But if the serpents are
facing away from each other,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
it means immortality
has been attained.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:10%
The alchemists, inspired
by ancient Egypt,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:10%
Greece, and the Gnostics, often
use the symbol of the Ouroboros

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:10%
or the serpent eating its own
tail to symbolize immortality

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:10%
and wisdom.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Genesis, Adam and Eve

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
eat from the tree of knowledge
after conversing with a talking

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
snake that moves up
a tree or the spine,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
as portrayed in
the Sistine Chapel

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:90%
by the master Michelangelo.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And isn't the
serpent Matthew also

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.383 align:middle line:84%
representative of
the devil, Satan?

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well that's where
the inversion came into play.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Because really when we
look at that history,

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
like they just pulled up that
story Jonny Enoch was talking

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
about, Genesis story
of the Garden of Eden,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
the serpent, what happened was
that depiction or description

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of that story was almost--
it was an inversion.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if you read that,
it's considered evil

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that, that serpent tempted
Adam and Eve with the knowledge

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:90%
of good and evil.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:90%
But why would you--

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we consider-- be considered evil
if you were to give knowledge

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.572 align:middle line:84%
in higher consciousness
to someone--

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it get
taken out of context?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.988 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: What happened
was, it ended up

00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
being religious wars
emerged, especially

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
with Constantine and the rise
of the Holy Roman Empire.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
With this-- again, the Roman
Empire with the Eagle, right?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It emerged a great
struggle over these

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
originally-- as we're going to
get into these original Anunna

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:84%
gods, which is what's
depicted in depicted

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
in Genesis, as these creator
gods that are basically

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
battling over our
realm of our reality.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, the Roman
Empire, the Holy Roman Empire

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:84%
emerging out of the
Roman Empire ended up

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
adopting the eagle as this great
symbol of power and conquering.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they basically demonized
and destroyed the serpent

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
civilizations around the world
like Jonny Enoch mentioned,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics and the
Great Hindu cultures

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
with the Nagas and the
Mesopotamian cultures

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the
Americas as we'll get into.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Sumerians wrote
a lot about the Anunnaki.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.623 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you think of that.

00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
My take on that entire
realm of information

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is slightly differs
from some researchers.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I ended up becoming quite
fascinated and almost

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.883 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with understanding
what the true story was.

00:11:08.883 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when I started
to read those stories--

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great story.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It's amazing.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you see comparisons
all around the world.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be the
first influencers on the rise

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
and fall of civilizations.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
they seem to be

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
where the source
of all civilization

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
emerged in-- for instance,
in ancient Sumer.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
We find that the Sumerian
civilization literally

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
came out of nowhere
with the city of Eridu

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
being the first
city ever created

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
with metallurgy and metal
husbandry and astronomy

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.243 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics and complex
languages and agriculture.

00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Really, the blueprints
and the building blocks

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of a civilization
just were handed down

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
by these Anunna or Anunnaki
gods to literally create

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.655 align:middle line:84%
civilization in
lower kingship, not--

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Not just random
archetypes of nature.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matthew, who corrupted
the symbol of the eagle?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The
symbol of the eagle

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
if-- for instance,
if you were to look

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
into Native American
cultures like in the United

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
States, the Pacific Northwest,
the eagle represents something

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
very different than it does to
a lot of other civilizations

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because there
are different interpretations

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of how we could view that.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're strictly talking
about ancient civilizations,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
their depictions
of the eagle come

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
from a place that's
very different than what

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:90%
we've been told.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, I really
want to strong emphasize

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that the symbols of the
serpent and the eagle

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.435 align:middle line:84%
very much changed
over and became

00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
something very different
than what they started as.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So we think of now like you
said, the devil or Satan

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.077 align:middle line:84%
or the underworld with a
serpent and this demonization,

00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and there's of course there's
an entire story that I can

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
get into on why that happened.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.862 align:middle line:84%
But basically, we're looking
at an inversion of that symbol.

00:12:45.862 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
why that happened.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Sure.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
The place that we can track
that to, the very earliest

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.225 align:middle line:84%
story where we know that
those symbols were established

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
in the way they were
and the reason they were

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
comes from an ancient tablet
known as the Legend of Etana.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Etana.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And the Legend of Etana
goes into this entire story

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of the eagle and the serpent,
which I want to point out

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is the first tablet
that actually discusses

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
this distinction
between these two,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
but not in a way where
they're describing

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
those symbols for
archetypes of humanity,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
but actually represented by
some of these Anunna gods.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in the
Garden of Eden story,

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the serpent that
tempts Adam and Eve

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
is this original figure that
came out of Mesopotamia.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.598 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the founder
of Eridu known as Enki.

00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
familiar with Enki.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:90%
That was his original name.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
His later Akkadian name was Ea,
and his symbol was the serpent.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And just like that, you find
the rise of civilizations

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.503 align:middle line:84%
underneath him, connections to
all that's the same mentality--

00:13:43.503 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
over the planet.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time, his counterpart

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
was known as Enlil,
lord of the air or--

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't
one kill the other?

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well they were
battling over control

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:90%
of our realm and our dominion.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil and according
to the stories,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
ended up-- if you read
the Legend of Etana,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
he describes in that
how Enki was forced

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to rule in the underworld
to be a positive counterpart

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of another being known as
Nergal, who was a negative war

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
god.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about it this way--

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like the devil.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.912 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it in the idea

00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that as above so below in
terms of the underworld

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and the higher dimensions
in our physical plane,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.572 align:middle line:84%
there always has
to be a balance.

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have to have a
positive and negative balance

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
in the underworld.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.583 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have to have a
positive-negative balance

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:31.108 align:middle line:84%
in the higher dimensions
or above the underworld.

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
that's what happened

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is that Enki was essentially
tricked in some ways

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.547 align:middle line:84%
or forced to rule in the
underworld in which he was then

00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
thrown under the bus, if
you want to use that term

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and just considered
this evil being.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
When really, the story
became very, very misled

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
by modern religions that
emerged out of Christianity.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think,
Matthew, really happened?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think what we're
looking at is a story of how--

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
when I've studied the best
translators in the world

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
for Sumerian cuneiform--

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
George Smith was
the first person

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to crack the code of ancient
Sumerian back in the 1800s.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
He figured out what no one had
known to read or understand

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in over 1,000 years.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.033 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian is considered
an isolated language

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that's not shared by anything
else around the world.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it doesn't
even have an alphabet.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It's simply made up of
enormous amount of characters.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And the language
itself is so ancient

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that it actually died
out, and no one alive

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:90%
knew how to read or write it.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so George Smith
came along in the 1800s

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and with this great
discovery of the Ashu-- known

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:84%
as the Ashurbanipal
Library, they

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
discovered an enormous cache
of these cuneiform tablets.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And he went through and spent
years and years and years

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
pouring in his
knowledge of ancient

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Assyrian and Sumerian
culture to translate them.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
one in over 1,000 years

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to start to break down
what that story was.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
his information was

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
verified by great experts,
Samuel Kramer and Stephanie

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Dalley.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
Zecharia Sitchin fit in?

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Zecharia
Sitchin was--

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
he started to interpret
these ancient tablets.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily agree
with all of his translations,

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
but he certainly got the
ball rolling for people

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to know what these stories
are and what they represent.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he
somewhat accurate?

00:16:14.613 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: He's
somewhat accurate.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But I disagree with some of
his interpretations for why--

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of humanity and
the reason why they came--

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that these Anunna gods came here
and what their purpose was--

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you do agree
that the gods did come here?

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're certainly not--

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
dramatic all by itself.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: No, they had
very direct conversations.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.185 align:middle line:84%
They used to have
a lot of-- they

00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
used to fight with one another
over what our role would be,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
not only in this Earth
but in the universe.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that comes across that's

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:84%
fascinating if you connect
the Legend of Etana

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
with these roles that
these different Anunna seem

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to take up in our reality.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
I want to make is,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.663 align:middle line:84%
I really-- the more
I've studied this,

00:16:51.663 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
the more I don't see it
as spaceship coming here

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and landing and
beings coming out.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
They seem to
inter-dimensional beings

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.758 align:middle line:84%
that are incredibly
powerful in the universe.

00:17:00.758 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that in
a lot of different texts.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, George Smith came
to the very same conclusion.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And he talked
about how they seem

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to come backwards and forwards
in time in our history

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
to basically intervene in these
certain events, in moments.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
the Anunnaki even

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
conceive of
influencing humanity?

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well
the actual story--

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
so if you were curious like,
what is the point of humanity?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:90%
How did it all start?

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Really where you get that
story comes from a tablet

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:90%
called the Atra-Hasis.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the Atra-Hasis,
you find out

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that there were these lower
beings right below the Great

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Anunna who are
known as the Igigi.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing all of this
physical work on the planet,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
describes how they were
clearing river channels.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know those river channels
are in the Fertile Crescent

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
known as the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
which if you don't clear
for agricultural purposes--

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
the Garden of Eden hit.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They can fill with
sediment, and then they

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
could become unusable.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So they were tasked and
described in the stories

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
as having to manually
clear these river channels

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:90%
and build these sacred temples.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
revolting, because they

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
considered themselves
like demigods

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and didn't want to
be doing this work.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
was, there was a decision

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
made among these Great
Anunna or Anunnaki

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
where they decided
to create humanity

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in their image to basically
do all the work of the gods.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And they called it the
Workload of the Gods.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias De Stefano
talked about the Anunnaki

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and the influence
they had on the humans

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.468 align:middle line:90%
on the series, "Initiation."

00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: Aessir,
those who came from the stars,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:10%
from the heavens, from the
unseen, what we call it.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:10%
They came from one of the stars
of the Orion's constellation.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Orion portal is one of the
most important in the galaxy.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
They were big people
like the Giants.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
They had this military shape
of body, really strong.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You can compare that with the
gods of Greece and Middle East

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that have all these
muscles and big beards.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were the first ones to
be really attached to humanity.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But what we have more pressing
today is what Aessir gave us.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Aessir gave us the
structure of society.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Aessir gave us the basis of
our culture and our society

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They gave us the construction
of the first temples

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:90%
with big stones.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
We can find these big stones
and big temples that they built

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and they created
all over the planet.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They had settlements
in Middle East

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
all over and in the
Mediterranean Sea,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:90%
in Central America, in Asia.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
They had different
spots wherever

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
you find these big blocks,
these big stones that

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
are the basements
for the new temples

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.272 align:middle line:84%
were guided by the Aessir
and built by humans.

00:20:10.272 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's pretty
accurate in terms

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of them coming here
and literally creating

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%
They discussed that.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
They used to describe
how they would

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.935 align:middle line:84%
build temples and pure spots
of energy on the Earth.

00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And today, when
we look at what's

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
known as the 30th parallel
across the planet,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:84%
we see that a lot of
these ancient sites

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
like Eradu and get
into the ancient Hindu

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.512 align:middle line:84%
temples like Barabar
caves and Ellora caves

00:20:33.512 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
areas around the world

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
as we continue throughout,
like Cairo, Egypt

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and in the Giza Plateau,
right through the Americas.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Seem like they built in
these very specific places

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
with these very
specific reasons.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
archetypes or the architects

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:90%
of essentially humanity.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And they would pick these
bloodline kings that were

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
related to their bloodlines.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would have them rule
over the rest of the people.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zecharia Sitchin
believes they came here

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:90%
in genetically altered us.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you accept that?

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I definitely-- when
I look at the work of experts

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:84%
like Lloyd Pye who've looked
into this early hominid,

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:90%
hominid--

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him by the way.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I do too.

00:21:12.323 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
He was a great man.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And he went into detail
looking at-- well,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:10%
if you look at the history of
the genetic history of mankind

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:10%
and the early Homo sapiens,
Neanderthals, Cro-Magnon,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:10%
type of early--

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:10%
early aspect of our story,
you find this gigantic leap

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:10%
that just comes out of nowhere
where our brain size doubles,

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:10%
and we all of a sudden lose
much of the hair on our body,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:10%
and we turn into
something very different.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
That seems to not be about this
natural survival on the planet,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
but something that's about a
more civilized type of being.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Something that's more of
like a steward of the planet,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
rather than just the survival
of the fittest aspect.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
secret societies

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.477 align:middle line:84%
tied around the serpent
are there, Matthew?

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That is where
secret societies really began.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what
came out of Babylon,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what
came out of Egypt--

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, we had the
followers of Horus.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we of course, we
know that they would often

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
depict a serpent coming
out of their forehead--

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were everywhere.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.083 align:middle line:84%
Which is known as
the third eye, which

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
is connected again to the pineal
gland and knowledge, higher

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
Naga Civilizations

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in India, which they worshipped
the serpent and the dragon.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And then in China, we
see the same thing,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
in Japan, throughout a
lot of Southeast Asia

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:90%
and right into the Americas.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Jonny Enoch mentioned how--

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:84%
so the Maya, their
serpent dragon God

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:90%
was known as Kukulkan.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the Aztec, theirs
was known as Quetzalcoatl.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And that as we go
down further South,

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the Inca and the pre-Inca
was known as Viracocha.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time we find this
serpent-dragon symbology,

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
which is often associated
with secret societies.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most famous
is known as the Brotherhood

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of the Serpent.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These societies,
why were they created?

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The idea was that
if knowledge wasn't protected

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
in certain key places,
the knowledge that

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
had been handed down, that it
could be lost and corrupted

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what would happen was,
initiates in great and temples

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
would be built and groups
would come together

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of certain individuals that are
of a higher conscious mindset,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
someone who saw the
universe in a different way

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and saw energy and consciousness
in a different way.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.810 align:middle line:90%
And they were hand-picked.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that they
were the regular people,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
commoners could just
join these schools.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
They were actually chosen
through these initiate groups

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
of individuals and then
these sects of groups

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:84%
formed around the world to
basically preserve and protect

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge that had
been handed down thousands

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years before.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.368 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
Freddy Silva

00:23:41.368 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief" who talked
about the serpent people.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>>FREDDY SILVA: And in 9600
BC, and this is actually

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:10%
written down in one of the
sacred books of the Maya.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Group of gods suddenly
arrives in what

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
today is called the Yucatan,
and they were called the Itz

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And they navigated
from stepping stone

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to stepping stone,
the remains of what

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
used to be a big
landmass in the Atlantic

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
from a place called Atl.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
They were really into
big names back then.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Aztec eventually called
the Atitlan or as we know it

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:90%
today, Atlantis.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atlantis.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they said that
basically, they were called

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
the People of the Serpent.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with being reptilian,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
just the fact that anyone who
harnessed the laws of nature

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
was deemed to be in control
of the serpent energy,

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.853 align:middle line:84%
because the serpents move
like this as does energy.

00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got to
be some truth to this.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Because of the same moments on
the other side of the Atlantic,

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a group of people
called the Ophiussa who

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
land in Portugal, in fact in
the location where I was born,

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.693 align:middle line:90%
which is really weird.

00:24:40.693 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were called the
People of the Serpent

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:90%
as well at the same time.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And they escaped the sinking
landmass in the Atlantic.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time in Egypt, they

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
show up as the
followers of Horus.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They're also People
of the Serpent.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
the same group of people

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
going out and repopulating
the world after everything

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:90%
been completely changed.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were there
so many symbolisms

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:90%
tied around the serpent?

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's
really the core symbol

00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
that represented knowledge
in higher consciousness.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at
the archetypes of humanity

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and these different
paths that we could take,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
there are really two distinctive
paths that we could take,

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
which is what really the
serpent and the eagle represent.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is
the path of taking

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
towards higher
consciousness, knowledge,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and basically this energetic
balance of both hemispheres

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and being--

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
being a being that doesn't
fall into the illusions

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of the material world
and conquering in war.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And but that is exactly what
the eagle ended up representing.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course it has nothing
to do with real eagles.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Real eagles are beautiful.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But it represents
this flying above all,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
seeing all, and conquering
all, and attacking from above.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil's the reason why
that symbol was first used.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
He can be shown in everything
from cylinder seals

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to his later
incarnations and things

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
like the Greek culture as Zeus
with an eagle on his shoulder.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- that
was his mentality

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and his domain in the way
that he decided basically

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
because of the laws of
duality here that exist.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They assumed different
roles within our reality.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially
what this great battle--

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
secret battle around the
world that most don't even

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:90%
know exist really came from.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
fact that it's again

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
at the cradle of civilization
is fascinating, isn't it?

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that those
symbols came from the Anunna.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't something that was
a later creation of humanity--

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been around
since the beginning of time.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.637 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: These are the
symbols they injected

00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
into our collective based
on the mentalities of how

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:90%
they would rule our realm.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where it
seems like this came down to,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
where there was jealousy
over how to rule us

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
in terms of this reality
we exist in where Enlil

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
was actually quite jealous over
the potential that humanity--

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a tablet called
the Myth of Adapa

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
where it's described how there's
jealousy over this being that

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:84%
gets created in perfection,
the first perfect man, who

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
they describe as being the
greatest among the Anunnaki.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It actually says that.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It says that not
only are we separate,

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
we are essentially them, but
like the children of them.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.648 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the
pinecone and handbag represent?

00:27:15.648 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's one
of my favorite things

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, because it's
a way where you can prove

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that, that knowledge that
emerged on the Fertile Crescent

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and then also was present
in Egypt and Atlantis

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
basically went around
the entire world.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we find, especially
in Mesopotamia and Iraq

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
is that the Anunna gods
are shown passing knowledge

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.003 align:middle line:84%
through the pinecone
to the pineal gland,

00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
like they pointed towards
the back of the head

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of a king and a priest.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:84%
There's those are the
two individuals that

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:84%
were chosen to essentially
be the hierarchy

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
to rule over humanity.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
One from the spiritual
religious side and one

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:84%
from the rulership side
of over the people.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they would show
these two symbols every time.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't just end there.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It emerged around the world,
and what that was, was

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
they would show the passing
knowledge to those individuals,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.500 align:middle line:90%
and they but--

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
they would also have in
their hand what looks

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:90%
like some kind of a handbag.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look into handbags,
they keep things that are safe.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
They keep things
to protect them.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe that
those symbols represented

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
was not a literal
representation at all.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe that again, symbolism
is language of the ancients,

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that they were showing
that these ancient gods had

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
all knowledge,
and that they were

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
passing the knowledge
that they had

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:90%
on to these kings and priests.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
mention one more thing--

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
if you go-- of course you see
in Egypt the symbol the serpent,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
but specifically in the Americas
with the Olmec civilization

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
in Veracruz, there's depictions
of the handbag with the serpent

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
being passed there, and
we find the same thing

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
with these handbag symbols
and Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So we see this spreading of
knowledge all around the world.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
injection of all these symbols

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
into our society?

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, the original
meanings behind those symbols

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
has great-- has
been greatly lost.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And now of course, people think
the serpent is evil and all

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%
of these different aspects.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But it really, it was injected
into those secret societies

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
where--

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to give an example when we look
at, say, the Maya, the Aztec,

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Toltec, and then we look into
the Inca, a lot of people

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
will be like, well,
hey, Matt, how

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
can you say that
these civilizations

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:84%
were created by the serpent and
were higher consciousness when

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
they were doing blood
sacrifice in war?

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And really what you find
is that those groups that

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:84%
are depicted-- the Maya
and the Aztec and the Inca

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
are actually a much later
civilization that came.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the original civilizations
that were founded there

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
call them the proto-Maya or
the proto-Aztec or proto-Inca.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Those were the ones that were
the pure civilizations that

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
were first created, and then
later on they became corrupted.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about secret
societies today, Matt?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Today--

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
based around this?

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they still hold
that knowledge and practice.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest-- the
symbols shown-- the Gnostics

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
had the symbol of the serpent.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And to them, Gnosis
represented knowledge.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is that
all around the world,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
there was secret societies
and groups that existed,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:90%
peppered all around the planet.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, the Holy
Roman Empire under the eagle

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these
other conquering empires

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
that I've studied, you look
at every flag and crest

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
of nearly every
empire in history,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
they've all had eagles or
variation of the eagle.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was, the war was

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that the Holy Roman
Empire decided

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to rewrite history.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they did.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.332 align:middle line:84%
And the way they did
that was by erasing

00:30:36.332 --> 00:30:38.540 align:middle line:84%
what is known as the old
religion, which was religion

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of the serpent, by
going around and burning

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Alexandria in
Egypt, destroying the Gnostics,

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and even going up-- and of
course conquering the Americas.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And eventually-- and of
course, that wasn't the Romans,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
but that was a
later Spanish group.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But then we saw-- essentially,
the best Roman story

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.120 align:middle line:84%
of that, which we'll I'm sure
we'll get into is St. Patrick.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
intentionally mislead people?

00:30:58.527 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They did.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who rewrote the
story to demonize the serpent

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and to make the eagle
seem like a symbol of just

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:90%
freedom and higher states.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:90%
But really it was the opposite.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We've been greatly
tricked in these symbols.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go
back and look at what

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:84%
the ancients said about
them, like Freddy Silva just

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:90%
described.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We know this knowledge was
passed all around the world.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.702 align:middle line:84%
And we know what it
originally meant.

00:31:21.702 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So we need to go
back, not forwards,

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and learn what we've
lost, and then reestablish

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and reintegrate that
into our thinking

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to see these symbols
and their meanings

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:90%
in a completely new light again.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
St. Patrick's Day.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
How does that tie into this?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:84%
That's actually one of the
saddest things of all--

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saddest, really?

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, it really is.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the most
misunderstood and saddest

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:84%
holidays that we
celebrate of all time.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, let me give you
an example of what that really

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.220 align:middle line:90%
represents.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
is going to ruin it

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people that
love St. Patrick's Day.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it has nothing
to do with Irish pride.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:90%
That's how it was shown later.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
leprechauns or Irish pride.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to--

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just killed
two great fantasy--

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I know.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Really, if you look
into what that was,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:90%
is that St. Patrick, right?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:90%
The St. Patrick was a Roman.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:90%
His father was a Roman official.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was tasked, just
like the Roman Empire did

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.382 align:middle line:84%
with cleansing-- destroying the
Gnostic people who originally

00:32:16.382 --> 00:32:18.590 align:middle line:84%
were the Egyptians and
burning library of Alexandria,

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:84%
he was tasked with going to
Ireland and the UK and Scotland

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.110 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But we specifically
think of it as Ireland,

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
because that was
the core of this.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.655 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Where
they went there,

00:32:29.655 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and they were supposed to
eradicate the last group

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that
was still studying

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:84%
was that ancient old religion
who were known as The Serpent.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
story of St. Patrick,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
he was reading the
serpents, the snakes--

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:90%
the snakes from Ireland.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you look all
throughout geologic history

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of that region, there's never
been snakes that lived there.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphor.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor for
the Druid people,

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and pagans as a more
general term, anyone

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.190 align:middle line:84%
who didn't follow this
monotheistic Christian

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:84%
religion, and they
were seen as a threat.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they were the last group
that had the ancient knowledge,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and they were greatly demonized
later-- so what happened was,

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
you're celebrating
the representation

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:84%
of the genocide and cleansing
of the last Serpent group

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, the Druids,
who build Stonehenge.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did St. Patrick's
have a staff and a serpent?

00:33:19.627 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That was Moses.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was Moses?

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Moses had the staff
and the serpent.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course you
look into that story

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and you find out
that he was commanded

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to destroy these ancient
bloodlines of the sons of Enoch

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
in the land of
Canaan, which go back

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.730 align:middle line:84%
to these bloodlines of
the Serpent and Enki

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.063 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning, who
are known as the Nepheline.

00:33:36.063 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went to
Chichen Itza back in 2017.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I did.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:84%
That was a really
enlightening trip for me.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And here's an image of
what I want to describe.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have been there.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very popular
tourist location.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But really what most
people are focusing on

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
is the Great Kukulkan's
temple in the very center.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish called
it El Castillo.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:57.643 align:middle line:90%
But when I was--

00:33:57.643 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for something
entirely different

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:90%
when I was there.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for evidence of
when the Maya became corrupted

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.830 align:middle line:90%
by the Eagle influences.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I recognized that
the Maya civilization had

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:84%
this great downfall, and
there was an influence that

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
arose later on in
their civilization

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:90%
that came at a different time.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.889 align:middle line:84%
And I found it in a
very obscure place.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a location that's
very small and almost no one

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:90%
visits it.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It sort of sits off to the
side of Kukulkan's temple known

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
as The Platform, the
Eagle, and the Jaguars.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this is
depicting right here.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just
explain this for a minute.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
What the Maya are showing
here in these glyphs

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:90%
is they're showing a story.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:90%
They're showing their story.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing how on the
right side, that's Kukulkan,

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and it could be shown with
snakes all coming out of him.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And notice, he's not
actually a feathered dragon

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:90%
like the symbols often show.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
That's a metaphor and a
symbol to describe his symbol,

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:84%
which was the serpent
and the dragon.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Notice how he's a man.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.949 align:middle line:90%
He's a-- he's a-- he's a man--

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With weird feet.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.215 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: With weird feet.

00:34:59.215 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But he also-- it shows the
symbols of the serpents

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:84%
coming out of him and what-- and
notice how it's in its own box,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it began.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
as Kukulkan creating

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
the Maya civilization and its
purity from the very beginning.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Now look, George,
what's in the middle.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we have
something very different

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that comes in.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We see an eagle
eating the pinecone.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.887 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Because
the pinecone is

00:35:24.887 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:90%
seen as a symbol of knowledge.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, if you look
at the influences of empires

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
knowledge was not

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
seen as a trait that was passed
along or really encouraged.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the eagle empires
like the Roman Empire

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
was all about domination
and control through fear.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about
passing knowledge.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So what you see there, just
like the flag of Mexico.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing the
eagle dominating

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of
those civilizations

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.497 align:middle line:84%
and corrupting them into a
war culture, which exactly

00:35:53.497 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:90%
what happened to the Maya.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
a passion for this.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I do.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: To me, when you
look at these breadcrumbs from

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:03.973 align:middle line:84%
the ancients and you track them,
they tell us the entire story

00:36:03.973 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:90%
of what we've been through--

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.840 align:middle line:84%
this great struggle
of civilizations

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.378 align:middle line:84%
rising and following based
on these various influences

00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and how it really
gets into the heart

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and core of who we are and about
who we were supposed to be.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And how really what
we're doing now

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is trying to regain the
knowledge of these Serpent

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Secret Societies that have
been destroyed systematically

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world by
Columbus in the North,

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Pizarro in South America
and Cortez in Mexico

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.923 align:middle line:84%
who systematically
conquered those

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:33.340 align:middle line:84%
civilizations and
destroyed them--

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And wipe them out.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.388 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: And wipe them out.

00:36:35.388 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're trying
to take those fragments

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and those pieces, put
them together again

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and then regain that knowledge.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That sculpture we
just saw from Chichen Itza,

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.838 align:middle line:84%
where was that in
relationship to--

00:36:45.838 --> 00:36:47.838 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's right
next to Kukulkan's Temple,

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's a small platform that
everyone just sort of walks

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.370 align:middle line:90%
right by.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've never heard
anyone discuss that.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.712 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I brought it up to tour
guides, and they have no idea--

00:36:56.712 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it guarded?

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.837 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It's not guarded.

00:36:58.837 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just not known about.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I think
it depicts this--

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
you could call it
forbidden story,

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that forbidden story
of what really happened

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to these civilizations and
how the influences that

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
destroyed them are very
much still in control today.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a lot of evil
behind these so civilizations?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you an
example back to the Maya

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:90%
showing the eagle.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that when
you look into the Maya,

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
they actually describe an
influence that came later.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:31.200 align:middle line:84%
They called it God L. And the
God L was shown all of a sudden

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
when Kukulkan departed
from that region and left

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and then created
civilizations elsewhere.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Something else-- another
influence came in.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Another Anunna god came in
and started influencing them.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.458 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is,
George, if I mentioned how

00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:84%
in the underworld, it's
ruled by a positive

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and a negative being.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Enki was the positive
being with a serpent,

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and then the eagle counterpart
was known as Nergal.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Now he was shown
as a god of war.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell it?

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: N-E-R-G-A-L. And
he was known as a god of war.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look
at the descriptions

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.200 align:middle line:84%
of God L in the Maya,
it's exactly the same.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And so what you're seeing is--

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.647 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:38:07.647 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: There's
battling of these energies

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to create civilizations and then
later corrupt and destroy them.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
our world was like then?

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:21.523 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Back then we can
imagine these isolated groups

00:38:21.523 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that were trading
with each other,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:84%
but isolated in
terms of not knowing

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the totality of these Anunna
gods and where they were.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance,
the Aztec were

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.840 align:middle line:84%
waiting for this
return of Quetzalcoatl.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.437 align:middle line:84%
They were waiting
for his return--

00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:36.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like
he was in a spaceship.

00:38:36.312 --> 00:38:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It's-- he left.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Essentially departed with his
groups of sages and mystics.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we don't
know where exactly he went.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But the point was,
the Spanish actually

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
knew the entire
Aztec story, and they

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:84%
realized that the only way that
they could conquer a Great War

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:84%
empire that the Aztec became was
to time Cortez's return exactly

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.370 align:middle line:84%
when Quetzalcoatl was
supposed to return to them.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And they confused
him with being--

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:84%
with being
Quetzalcoatl, and then

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:84%
he was subsequently able
to conquer Moctezuma

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
and the entire Aztec empire.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do these
secret societies today,

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, embed their symbolisms
in our own futures and lives?

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well I mean, again
in the modern medical industry

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and all these
prestigious symbols,

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:90%
the serpent is still there.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:84%
It's still present in
the most highest esteemed

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:90%
establishments.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So how can it really be that
evil symbol that we know

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:90%
or that were taught, right?

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the problem is
that those secret societies

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that really practice
this were literally

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.400 align:middle line:90%
eradicated all over the world.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:84%
That was the purpose
of St. Patrick

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Druids-- with
the Druids in Ireland

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and how the Romans conquered
all the way through the Gnostics

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.100 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and all those areas.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.080 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
wipe that story out,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.928 align:middle line:84%
so that knowledge
would be truly lost--

00:39:49.928 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They almost did.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They almost did.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In "The Secret
Life of Symbols,"

00:39:53.838 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the late Jordan Maxwell
discusses his idea of symbolism

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:90%
with secret societies

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JORDAN MAXWELL: You have to be
careful about secret societies.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:10%
Because these
different societies

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:10%
become very powerful
and very wealthy,

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:10%
but they have an agenda.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They have a particular
agenda that they're

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to create or
to bring into being.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they will build
the whole world around you.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And you accept what--

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.030 align:middle line:84%
when you're a child or a
baby, you come into the world,

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and you just accept everything.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't grow up,
you just-- as a grown person,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:84%
you just accept
whatever there is.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the way it is.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.520 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the way it is.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And you keep in
mind that there were

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.180 align:middle line:84%
secret societies
that were involved

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in founding this country.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.970 align:middle line:90%
And who were they?

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And what were they trying to do?

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.866 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:49.866 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:10%
You have to know
secret societies

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:10%
to understand why there are
so many different symbols

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:10%
and emblems in Washington
DC and around the world.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
different groups,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
societies that are working
towards certain agenda.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.370 align:middle line:10%
And they are putting symbols
out that represent their agenda.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jordan Maxwell, who
passed away at the age of 82,

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:90%
will be missed sorely.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yes, he will.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why were
there even secret societies

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.560 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.935 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
it was generally

00:41:23.935 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:84%
understood that this
knowledge was not

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:middle line:84%
able to be understood
by the masses.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
would only be allowed

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to be understood by those
who had the consciousness

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and capacity to understand it.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.458 align:middle line:90%
And so they recognize that.

00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not
you agree with it,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.810 align:middle line:84%
it's just the way that it was
decided that only small groups

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:90%
were created around the world.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Now just like was
mentioned in that video,

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:84%
those secret societies,
the original Serpent Secret

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Societies were first
conquered, and then

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.820 align:middle line:84%
the other original societies
were gradually became

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.620 align:middle line:90%
corrupted.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to point out, it's
mentioned the founding fathers

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.980 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Those are known
as the Freemasons.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
founding fathers were

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
part of the Freemasons, which is
a secret society that actually

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:90%
still--

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Corruptible--

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exist today.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But what's funny is that or
not funny but interesting

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:90%
is that, Benjamin--

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Franklin knew about
what the symbol of eagle meant.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Its a conquering symbol.

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And he actually wanted the
symbol of the United States

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:90%
to be a turkey.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A turkey?

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Completely
diff-- think

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.890 align:middle line:84%
about a turkey is on the
ground rather than flying.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.258 align:middle line:90%
It represents the opposite.

00:42:23.258 --> 00:42:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a
bird, but it doesn't

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
represent the same thing
that the eagle does.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's our future
hold for us, Matthew?

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.372 align:middle line:90%
Look into your crystal ball.

00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think our
future is really bright.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because what we have
now is the internet

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
has allowed
like-minded individuals

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to no longer hide
in the shadows.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:84%
The secret societies
are no longer

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:84%
hidden behind this
term, esoteric.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:90%
This term of hidden knowledge.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Now it's in the open for
anyone who wants to learn.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you get groups
on like social media and people

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.610 align:middle line:84%
around the world that are
sharing, coming together

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back
this shared knowledge

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:90%
from these secret societies.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being secret,
now it's just completely open.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It just takes the
inquisitive mind of someone

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:84%
who's open-minded enough
and curious to want

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to know the truth to break
down these old paradigms

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and then reforge to learn what
the secrets of the ancients

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do some of
these secret societies

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:84%
know that there are
people like you who

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:19.833 align:middle line:90%
have decoded their messages?

00:43:19.833 --> 00:43:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
that they're probably

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.990 align:middle line:84%
happy that the torch is
being carried by a younger

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.120 align:middle line:84%
generation that is
passionate enough

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
to want to return this
knowledge in the light of truth,

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.210 align:middle line:84%
not in a corrupted way,
but in a way where what did

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
the original secret societies
known as the Old Religion

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.123 align:middle line:84%
like I mentioned around the
world, what were they trying

00:43:37.123 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to say, what were they
trying to pass to us,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
what exactly did that
knowledge mean to represent us

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.420 align:middle line:90%
in our state in this reality?

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that it represents
reaching higher states

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.530 align:middle line:90%
of energy to reach Kundalini.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what's mimicked by all
these groups, whether it's

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:84%
the Nagas and the ancient
monks and the Hindu

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.980 align:middle line:84%
cultures to the
Chinese cultures back

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity to the Egyptians
and the Mesopotamians

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Mediterranean and
the Druids and the Americas.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They're all saying
the same thing

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.928 align:middle line:84%
that we all have the power
to become gods ourselves

00:44:08.928 --> 00:44:10.970 align:middle line:84%
if we simply can remember
what the knowledge that

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:90%
was lost once was.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matthew, predict
our future for us.

00:44:14.245 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think that
what we're seeing right now

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is there is a cauldron
of water on an oven

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.890 align:middle line:84%
right now that
represents consciousness,

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's a top
that's being held down

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.720 align:middle line:84%
by certain controlling
elites around the world,

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.910 align:middle line:84%
corrupted controlling
elites, that don't

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.410 align:middle line:90%
want that knowledge known.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
holding down this top.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing
about, if you think

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:84%
about that in terms
of where we're going

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is that, cauldron of water,
that bubbling cauldron,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that top can't stay
on there forever.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
eventually blow off.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I see our path
as a conscious society here

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.380 align:middle line:84%
on Earth is that slowly
the truth is being known

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:84%
by more and more
people around the world

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
until that old paradigm
in an illusion falls.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
bullish on the future?

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.762 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I'm very optimistic.

00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that we will
return to the Golden

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Age with the knowledge
that we once had,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be able to take all
the technology we have now

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:10.298 align:middle line:84%
and combine it to reach a
new stage of our human story

00:45:10.298 --> 00:45:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that's never been
able to be reached,

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.420 align:middle line:84%
because there have
been so many falls

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of these civilizations that
haven't allowed them to reach

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.720 align:middle line:90%
the next stage.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
a hold of you, Matthew?

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.997 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: People
can find my work

00:45:20.997 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:10%
through my website at
TheStageOfTime.com.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm also on YouTube
under Matthew LaCroix

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.790 align:middle line:10%
and under Instagram
under thestageoftime.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:30.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your next project?

00:45:30.508 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right now,
I'm finishing writing

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.067 align:middle line:84%
a co-authoring a book with Billy
Carson where we're writing--

00:45:35.067 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
it's known as the Epic of
Humanity where we're telling--

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
the world of Billy.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.653 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The true
story of humanity.

00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
traveling down actually.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.310 align:middle line:10%
Him and I and several
others meeting

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.890 align:middle line:10%
with Brien Foerster in
South America in Bolivia

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:10%
to go to these ancient
megalithic sites

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:10%
to show the story
of how there was

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.457 align:middle line:10%
different civilizations
that came and left that

00:45:53.457 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:10%
have come a lot over time.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Report back to
us when you come back.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exciting.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Matt, for
being on the program.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Thank you, George.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These secret societies
have meant so much to our past,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:10%
but they really have
influenced our future.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
