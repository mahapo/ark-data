>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Anthony Sanchez with us,
author of the amazing book

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
"UFO Highway," which really does
an amazing job investigating

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:90%
UFO cases.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
He currently works to
bring public awareness

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
of the secret
underground facilities,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
alien/human hybridization
programs, and the weaponization

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Anthony, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY SANCHEZ: Thank you
so much for having me, George.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're looking good.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.035 align:middle line:90%
How you been?

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I'm doing great.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keeping busy?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.497 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Absolutely.

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your
response to your book

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
after you wrote it?

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
You got the kind of notoriety
and publicity you got.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: You know, right
away I became somewhat

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:10%
of a controversial figure in the
UFO community because, whenever

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:10%
you--

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:10%
it's sort of like
what's happening right

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:10%
now with the Trump
administration,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.277 align:middle line:10%
they have this anonymous,
you know, op-ed.

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:84%
When you interview an
anonymous source who

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
has incredible information about
the military industrial complex

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
working alongside aliens, it's
going to create controversy,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make me
a controversial figure,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
let alone the source
of the material.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in the research, Anthony,
of UFOs and the Secret Space

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Program?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So since the time I was a child,
I've had my own engagement.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether it
be UFO sightings--

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I was abducted
by aliens when I was a child.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And I've
written about this.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I've written about this.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know about it--

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you have.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.138 align:middle line:90%
You've documented that.

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --but I've shared
that with other researchers.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've done
some personal writings

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
on my experiences,
and I've shared them.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Jones from the UK,
Norio Hayakawa from New Mexico,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Rio Rancho, New Mexico.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people seem to
think that those experiences

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
as a child is what propelled
me into the research

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.105 align:middle line:90%
as a young man.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're right, that's
exactly what propelled me

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
into the research.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I need to know what
happened to me as a child.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've seen orbs, I've
seen cubes, I've seen massive,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, classic
saucer-shape UFOs.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.478 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what has
thrusted me into this research.

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And take
this the right way,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
but you're obsessed with
trying to get these answers.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Absolutely.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like a lifelong obsession.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have to know
what me and countless others

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
have encountered.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.305 align:middle line:84%
You know, is it something
that is in our mind,

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
or is it something that's
physical, or is it both?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard
getting to the bottom

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of these types of
answers, especially

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're delving into the
supernatural, the paranormal,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
the esoteric, because
the experts that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
are in academia who could
possibly offer guidance or give

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.315 align:middle line:84%
you some sort of answer,
they shy away from it.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to talk about it.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're left within our
own community of researchers

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
to engage with one
another and try

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.028 align:middle line:90%
to come up with the answers.

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony,
the president wants

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
an additional military force
called the Space Force.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
There are some who say
we already have it.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you say?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We do already
have a space force.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Air Force.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you look going back
decades with the Air Force,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
they currently manage over
300 classified satellites

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in space, not to mention
countless other satellites

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
from private sector
firms who have

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to work with the military
to make sure that everything

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is kosher up in space.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing that
I find interesting.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2017, there was actually
a congressional committee

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that was pushing for an
independent operating body

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
outside of the Air Force
for the purposes of space.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were pushing
for it because they

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
felt that the Air Force had
dropped the ball when it came

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
to Russia and China, who are
our two major adversaries when

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the weaponization
and/or militarization of space.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do we stand
right now, in your opinion,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%
with the weaponization of space?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: The whole genesis
of the weaponization of space

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
can be traced back to the 1950s,
when the Space Race began.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But really, in 1967, there
was the Outer Space Treaty.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was a treaty that
had stated that anything

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
was fair game except for
weapons of mass destruction

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
in outer space.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Where that puts us today is
space is heavily weaponized.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have already
seen demonstrations

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.605 align:middle line:90%
from the Chinese--

00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the most recent
demonstration was

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
from the Chinese,
whereby they have

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
developed ASAT technology, which
is anti-satellite technology.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.885 align:middle line:84%
They had literally blasted
an aging weather satellite

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.338 align:middle line:84%
out of low earth orbit
as a demonstration

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to both the Russians
and to the Americans--

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they could do it.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.338 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --that
they could do it.

00:05:17.338 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
There are laser-based
satellite systems

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that are disruptive
systems, a jamming

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
system to jam the signals
between the satellites.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't realize
is that our entire existence

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
today hinges on our
ability to communicate

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:90%
via satellite technology.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Without the satellites
that are in space now,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have
GPS technology--

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cell phones, nothing.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --cell phone
technology, and our military

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.793 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to communicate.

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese
know that, if they

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
were to take out just a
few critical satellites

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that the United States
military operates,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.985 align:middle line:84%
they would essentially cut off
all communications worldwide

00:05:56.985 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
between the various
branches of the military.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And it would leave
us wide open for attack.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the first
thing we do when we attack?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:90%
We take out command and control.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:90%
We did that in Iraq.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:90%
We did it in Afghanistan.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what we do.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: That's right.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So you know, whether it's
ground-based telecommunication

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, space-borne
telecommunication, all of it

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.455 align:middle line:84%
is critical to the success
of these military operations.

00:06:24.455 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Carol Rossen, who

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
once was the right-hand aide
to the father of our space

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
program, Wernher von Braun,
was part of the group that

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:90%
put the treaty together.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, my name's
Carol Rossen.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to introduce to you
today a treaty that all of us

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:10%
can work on that can actually
change the whole game that's

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:10%
causing so many problems and
challenges on this planet,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:10%
that's causing so
much suffering,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:10%
so much damage, and
possibly the obliteration

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:10%
of the whole human species.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that a
game was being played.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's aimed at
weaponizing outer space.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.408 align:middle line:90%
And why is that important?

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Why is this an important
issue when we have

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:90%
so many problems on the planet?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:84%
It's because it is the
place, outer space, where

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we can transform the entire war
industry into a space industry.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:10%
I've been working in the last
couple of months on a treaty

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:10%
that we named the Outer Space
Security and Development

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Treaty of 2011.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:10%
And as quickly as
possible, you and I

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:10%
can work to get this signed.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:10%
What's unique about
it is it's going

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:10%
to put a lid on the
total war industry,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:10%
while allowing it to transform
into a space industry.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
was created in 2011.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Mhm.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it have teeth?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: You know, I met with
Dr. Carolyn Rosalynn in Bucks

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
County, Pennsylvania.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
This is back in 2012.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.578 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And she and
I had a discussion, just

00:07:51.578 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
a brief discussion.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We were traveling
from one location

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to another on the bus
as part of this group.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
made it clear to her

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that I felt a treaty
of that nature was--

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
substance behind it.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
However, unfortunately, space
was already heavily weaponized

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: If you go back to--

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More so now.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --right.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back to the
Reagan administration,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
when they started talking
about the Strategic Defense

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Initiative, this is what kicked
off Star Wars technology.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
why that happened

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is because we realized
that China at that time

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
was capable of developing highly
advanced integrated circuit

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
technology and keeping on
par with technology that

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
was emerging from America
and the United States,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
both the private sector
and the military.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I mean,
yes, there's substance

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
behind that sort of
a treaty, however, we

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
need to start thinking
beyond treaties,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and we need to start
thinking about mitigating

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the event of some sort
of a space-borne attack.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And most likely, it's going
to be from the Chinese.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The Russians just
released a satellite

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that has done something
completely strange that

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
has dumbfounded our
military industrial complex.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
All of the key contractors that
operate within the US military,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
figure out how is it

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that the Russians can create
a satellite that's berthing

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
itself in low earth orbit.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.502 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
get answers from Russia,

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
why are you developing
a satellite that's

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.202 align:middle line:90%
berthing itself?

00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, because if
you think of the analogy

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.785 align:middle line:84%
of a Russian doll,
there's the big one,

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.118 align:middle line:84%
then there's a little one
inside it, then a littler one.

00:09:39.118 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
satellite's doing.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating some
sort of like a path,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:90%
like a pathway of communication.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very sophisticated.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: What's
bothering us about that

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not giving
any explanation as to what

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:90%
it's for.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to tell us.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So you know, so
there's a lot that's

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
happening up there right now
that's just causing a lot of--

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to say chaos
within the military.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stress?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
do we have, Anthony?

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:90%
What do we have up there?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
We've got to have something.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we have
highly sophisticated systems up

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:90%
there right now, currently.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.172 align:middle line:84%
I was privy to some
information about one

00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
of the most sophisticated
projects that's

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:90%
on record, Leonid.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
We may have discussed
this before,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
but Leonid is the low earth
orbit nanosatellite interceptor

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:90%
defense system.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's up there now.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.608 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's up there now.

00:10:33.608 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
I was put in contact

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
with this couple, a
mother and daughter,

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.793 align:middle line:84%
and they had
information that they

00:10:43.793 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
wanted to share with
me as a researcher.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
They knew what I work in.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And she had said to me that her
husband was an engineer working

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
at Lockheed Martin,
and he made the mistake

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of announcing to some
people at a party

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that they were hosting that
they had successfully launched

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the nanosatellites part
of this Leonid project

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:90%
into low earth orbit.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.798 align:middle line:84%
Well, he went
missing a week later.

00:11:03.798 --> 00:11:04.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh.

00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:05.398 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they ever find him?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.415 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --they
found him dead.

00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:10.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh.

00:11:10.215 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: And I--

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Foul play, no doubt.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --right, so
apparently he suicided himself.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With no blood around
or something, probably.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --no, they
found him in a car

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
in a parking lot outside
of Moffett Field.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a
shot in the head.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
There was an
abandoned McDonald's,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.042 align:middle line:84%
well-known place
in Moffett Field.

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Married
kid and everything

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be going well.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had been in contact with
Project Camelot, Kerry Cassidy,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and together we confirmed that
this was a legitimate, you

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
know, inside job.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that project propelled
me into further research

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
into Black Project projects,
specifically with companies

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
that were around where I was
based in northern California.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And through doing some
research with Aerojet--

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
there was a company
called Aerojet--

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I was able to uncover
congressional documentation

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that pointed me towards the
existence of that project

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Leonid.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I shared that with
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I gave her the
information on that.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I remember.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And I started
receiving phone calls, visits

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.555 align:middle line:84%
to my house from
people that said

00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:19.433 align:middle line:84%
they were from AFOSI, and to
not look into these projects.

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that I was
writing a book, because I--

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they threaten you?

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --you could
call it a threat, you know,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
when they say don't
release the book, you know,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.898 align:middle line:84%
that you're planning
on working on.

00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
little bit unnerving.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:90%
It was unnerving.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's really scary when you
delve into these projects that

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
are military-based, when you
start to uncover the-- when you

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
start to uncover information
that they don't want known

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to the general public,
you will get contacted.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell
you exactly what

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
it is you're doing
that's wrong, and what's

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
going to get you into trouble.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
running a country,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you want
weaponization in space?

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: The answer
to that is yes, I

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
would want the
weaponization of space,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
but not so much for the
purpose of being antagonistic,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
but for the purpose
of mitigating

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:90%
what others might do to us.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do you
think it's been going on?

00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We know that
the weaponization of space

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.025 align:middle line:84%
has been happening regularly
since the 1980s, for sure.

00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ASAT technology
has been developed by both

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:90%
the Russians and the Chinese.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But when you jump all the way
up into more recent times,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
you know that the
advancement in the technology

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
has just been exponential,
because if you think

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
about the X37B, which was on a
classified mission in low earth

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
orbit for 287
straight days, this

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
was the first classified
mission, a lot of people

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
believed that it was
not just an ISR, which

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
is intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance, you know--

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mission.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --mission,
they believed

00:13:58.218 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that it was also a mission
slated for deployment

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.472 align:middle line:84%
of classified technologies
that were inside

00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:84%
of the bay of the
extraterrestrial.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's possible.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia program
"Deep Space,"

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
weaponization of the moon.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Project Horizon was an
idea put forth by the military

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1950s for
sending a man to the moon.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was that
they would basically

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:10%
just launch some
guys to the moon,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:10%
leave them there, and
shoot them supplies

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.872 align:middle line:10%
until they could figure out
a way to get them back home.

00:14:30.872 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of a way of
politically beating

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.782 align:middle line:10%
the Russians to the moon.

00:14:33.782 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting
about Project Horizon,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.907 align:middle line:10%
though, is that
they were supposed

00:14:36.907 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:10%
to be sent to the moon
with nuclear weapons.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They were sent there
with nuclear missiles.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question
you have to ask

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:10%
is, if you're going to send
weapons on an expedition

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.162 align:middle line:10%
like that, exactly who are
you defending yourself from?

00:14:51.162 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to start a
nuclear war with the Russians

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:90%
by fighting with them?

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to start a war
with the German flying saucers?

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Or were we sending nuclear
weapons there with them

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
to protect them from aliens.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
interesting question.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine any reason why
we would send nuclear weapons

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
to the moon other than
dealing with aliens or Germans

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who had very
advanced technology.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing that you see
is that you see the military

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
kicking off a
series of programs.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
You see the army
goes out and comes up

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:90%
with Project Horizon to land--

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
by 1962, to land 200
soldier astronauts,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
as they called it, on
the moon, and to build

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
a permanent installation.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:10%
Then you see the Air Force,
they come out with Lunex,

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:10%
the same kind of model,
except they wanted theirs

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:10%
to be a little more mobile.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Soviets at
the same time came out

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
with Zvezda, which
was, again, to build

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:84%
a subsurface permanent
facility on the moon.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's been going
on for a long, long time,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:90%
this weaponization.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even looking
at Mike Barratt talking

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
about sending men to
the moon on basically

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
a one-way trip
with nukes, I mean,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:90%
my god, what are they planning?

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, you know,
there's also the idea that we

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
may be defending from something
else other than another hu--

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aliens?

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --right,
it could be aliens.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask
me, are we under threat

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:90%
from a potential alien invasion?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It sounds outlandish,
when you think about it.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.380 align:middle line:90%
But.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: But you have
some high-level individuals

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
throughout mainstream academia
who have warned against,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
one, the existence
of aliens, two,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the malevolent nature
of them, three,

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
because of how
unsophisticated we

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
are by comparison
to a species that

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
could make it all
the way to our planet

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and introduce themselves.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Hawking comes to mind.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
very clear about,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
if aliens were to
make themselves known

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.775 align:middle line:84%
and introduce
themselves to humanity,

00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't be good for us.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It would be a lot like when
Columbus visited the Indians.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
That didn't turn out too
well for the Indians.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's absolutely true.

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You've investigated underground
facilities on this planet.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.486 align:middle line:84%
Where are they, and what
are they being used for?

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: The largest one
we know of is in China.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: China.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.123 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: In China.

00:17:18.123 --> 00:17:21.059 align:middle line:84%
3,500 plus miles of
state-of-the-art underground

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:90%
facilities.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
These are magnetic--

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.018 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --these
are magnetically

00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
shielded,
electronically grounded,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're living facilities.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody knows
that the construction

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
was undertaken by the
People's Liberation Army.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And Philip A. Carver, who
was a former Pentagon analyst

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and specialist who was also a
professor and who led a team

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that conducted a
two-year-long survey--

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
a study.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:90%
They uncovered it.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
However, people like
us in the UFO field,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.392 align:middle line:84%
in the research field,
we get information,

00:17:51.392 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
we're privy to
information from insiders.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had information,
that information--

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Years ahead.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --well, not
years, but let's say months.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm giving you credit.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Months ahead of time.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And weeks before
they went public,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I went public on several main
outlets for the UFO community.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The late Jerry
Pippin, Mel Fabregas

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
with the "Veritas Show,"
and several other shows.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had given the
information about the existence

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
of these facilities.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I like to draw a parallel to

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is they say, well, why did
the Chinese build all of this?

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Because Philip Carver,
Professor Carver's study

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
said that, oh, do you
house nuclear weapons

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and other facets of
the military, you know,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:90%
equipment and whatnot?

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Who needs 3,500
miles to do that?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's overkill.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
The real reason
is they're living

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:90%
facilities for the elite class.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
For instance, remember
the movie "2012?"

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:90%
They had the arks.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
If you had a billion
euros, you had your ticket,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
you were safe in the event
of a major catastrophe.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
believe that there's

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
something forthcoming,
whether it's

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:84%
World War III, some
sort of invasion,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.536 align:middle line:84%
or it could be something
natural, like, you know,

00:19:09.536 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:90%
a coronal mass ejection.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
These facilities,
from what I've been

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
told, from people who
said they've seen them,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
they're like meant for a
billionaire class of people.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have them here
in the United States, too, in--

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.698 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: What we have here
in the United States are

00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
we have a disparate network
of underground facilities.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:84%
We have amazing military
underground facilities,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
like In Dulce.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think there's
some here in the Denver area,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:90%
under the airport.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.568 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well,
Denver International,

00:19:46.568 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that
there's a massive continuity

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
of government facility that--

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they unearth
enough dirt to--

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that's equal to the amount
of 11 Great Pyramids.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:90%
This is a massive amount.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:10%
So we also know that the private
sector has also begun to delve

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:10%
into the construction of
state-of-the-art underground

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:10%
facilities.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
If you just Google SubTropolis,
you're going to find

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
a million-square-foot facility
here in the United States that

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
has state-of-the-art data
centers, office facilities,

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.857 align:middle line:90%
refrigeration facilities.

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And there are roadways in there.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And some people claim
that the roadways,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:84%
they're 1,600
miles long, going--

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --all the way
up to Washington, DC.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe this?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I don't have to
believe it, I've seen it.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've seen it?

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah,
SubTropolis actually exists.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to ask ourselves,
do facilities like SubTropolis

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
actually exist within
the military world?

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
We know the Raven Rock facility.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
We know of Cheyenne Mountain.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
underground facilities.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh, those
are antiquated facilities.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.987 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so sure about
that, because there is

00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:02.195 align:middle line:90%
ongoing military operations--

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:03.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're probably
state-of-the-art.

00:21:03.987 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --right, and there's
constantly retrofitting these

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
facilities, making them--

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
isn't it smart, though,

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.876 align:middle line:90%
to be ready for a catastrophe?

00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --I think so.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I don't see
anything sinister about it.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The sinister part
is that they're not

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
telling the American
public about it, because--

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --these facilities
are for them, not for us.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we knew that, the
world would go crazy.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly
making these discoveries

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
about potential
asteroids that could

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
cause an extinction-level
event here on Earth.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, with that sort
of knowledge, we have to ask,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is there some part
of the government

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
that is actively constructing
underground facilities?

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.183 align:middle line:90%
And if they are, for who?

00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we think
the answer is yes.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For them.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you say them, I want
to point to the elite class.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.412 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --which
would include, you know,

00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
high-level
politicians, you know--

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The rich, the famous.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --the rich.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.978 align:middle line:90%
The very, very rich, yeah.

00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't have a ticket.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I don't.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We won't be going.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, at least
we're warning everybody.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
always told people,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
if an asteroid
comes our way when

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.792 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing "Coast to Coast,"
that's what I'll be doing.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I'll be listening.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you have this
whole community of preppers.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, we discuss a lot on
"Coast to Coast," you know,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
you have the entire prepper
community out there.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have
people in states like Nevada

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and way up in northern
California, preppers

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that are building their
own underground facilities.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
plans online how

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to construct your own
two-story underground facility

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to last for five to 10 years
in the case of something

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:90%
catastrophic.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they're vacuum
sealing rice and beans,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're storing away water
and they're putting away fuel,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.335 align:middle line:84%
they're building these
ingenious solar panel

00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
system, electrical systems.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.365 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
what they're doing.

00:22:59.365 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony, paint
us a picture, though.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:84%
If you go into one of these
underground shelters for 10

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
years because of some calamity
that occurred outside,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and you come back out after
10 years, what's left?

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.747 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, you have
to figure-- let's say

00:23:16.747 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:90%
if it was a nuclear event.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.307 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.307 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
There would have
been a nuclear winter

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that we would have to have--

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh,
everything's obliterated.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --everything is gone.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So resources would be
something to consider.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.613 align:middle line:84%
You know, is the
water drinkable,

00:23:30.613 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:90%
is the air breathable.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So who wants to
live in that environment?

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.322 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I've come
to terms with the idea

00:23:36.322 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that, if something
were to happen,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'd make the
effort to try and survive

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
through it, you know, in an
underground type facility.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, think of
the planet the way it was

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and the way it could be.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too upsetting.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I like to
think that the Earth,

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:84%
the humanity is here on Earth,
and we're somewhat parasitic,

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and that we eventually will be
gone and the Earth will return

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to what it naturally is,
which is a beautiful green--

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we ever
get helped by the ETs?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Would they come
here and save us?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.135 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: It's
so funny, George,

00:24:12.135 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
attending a lot of
the conferences,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
like the Awake and
Aware Conference,

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
all the different
conferences, you know,

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
there are individuals
out there who

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
truly believe that we
are already interacting

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
with alien species who are
just watching and waiting

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to see if we're going
to make that next step

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
towards a positive
evolution or we're

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
going to devolve through
something like a World War III.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.495 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
questions that comes up

00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what you asked,
are they going to intervene,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.168 align:middle line:84%
or can they prevent
that from happening?

00:24:46.168 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some pretty
convincing arguments

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that it will happen,
that we're being

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
monitored by alien
species who don't

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:90%
want us to destroy ourselves.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we coexist
with them, Anthony?

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I guess the question then
would be then, well, OK,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:10%
if there were these ancient
astronauts, as they call them,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:10%
in our distant past,
did they all leave,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:10%
or are some of them still here?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
How do you answer that?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's real simple.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You look at, truthfully and
clearly, at human history.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
If, as we're taught
in school, we're

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the product of just a slow
evolutionary climb from cavemen

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to hunter-gatherers to
city-states to nations

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to empires, as we're
taught, then that

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
should be our history, and
there shouldn't be anything else

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.475 align:middle line:10%
But if you look
carefully, you'll

00:25:34.475 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:10%
find that, from the flying
boats of the ancient Egyptians

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:10%
to the dragons of the Chinese
to the Dogon tribe in Africa

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:10%
that talks about the
people come from Sirius,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:10%
and you talked
with the Aborigines

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:10%
in Australia that
talk about the gods,

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:10%
you talk about the
Aztecs and the Incas that

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.560 align:middle line:10%
talk about the
gods from the sky,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:10%
and then you bring it
right on up to the UFO,

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:10%
to the cattle mutilations,
to the crop circles,

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.155 align:middle line:10%
to the abductions,
somebody's still here.

00:26:04.155 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The late Jim Mars.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.133 align:middle line:90%
I miss him, Anthony.

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Absolutely.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
great researcher.

00:26:08.425 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: You know, I had a
great conversation with him

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.370 align:middle line:84%
before he passed in a
little video on YouTube.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
a lot of the ideas that

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
came out of that man's
mind were just amazing.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
But he's absolutely right.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, they
put me on the spot,

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and they say, OK,
Anthony, are we alone?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And my answer to that is no.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Our history, the history
of humanity as a whole--

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and you look at all the various
evidence that's out there,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, it points back
to this timeline going back

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
almost 13,000 years that shows
that there was something,

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
there was some
group of individuals

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
here-- now, well, if you
look at the Sumerians,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
they talk about the Anunnaki.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And they quite clearly
state that they are not

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:90%
from this world.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're nine to 12
feet tall, highly intelligent,

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
highly powerful, and they were
talking about the gods that

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.007 align:middle line:90%
are coming out of the Acadian--

00:27:09.007 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're right
there in the Book of Genesis,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:90%
too, by the way.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --right, when
they talk about the Nephilim.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, in the Bible,

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a passage
that actually mentions

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:84%
one of these gods of the
Sumerian list of kings

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:90%
and gods--

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Anunnaki.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.502 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Anunnaki,
which goes back,

00:27:27.502 --> 00:27:29.255 align:middle line:90%
like over a million years back.

00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 400,000
years maybe, at least?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, some of
them, right, but actually

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.240 align:middle line:84%
some of them go back a
million, 500,000 years.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: So but
Tammuz is mentioned

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:84%
is one of these deities that
existed 250,000 years ago,

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
but then Tammuz is actually
mentioned in the Bible,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all well documented.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But yes, one of the things we're
learning now through research

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is that there's scientific
evidence that actually points

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to an event that happened some
13,000 years ago that nearly

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:90%
wiped out humanity.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:90%
And at that time--

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it wipe
out Atlantis, too?

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --right.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the writings
that came from Plato and--

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I forget the-- there's
one of Plato's relatives,

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:84%
he's a direct descendant of
another Greek philosopher,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
but he talks about Atlantis, and
the timing works out perfectly

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that it would have
been at this juncture

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
in time which was
around 13,000 years ago.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing, a
lot of the writings

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly
existed on Atlantis

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and what these people
were all about disappeared

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:84%
when the library of Alexandria
was burnt to the ground.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
We lost so much
about early humanity

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
that it's just unrecoverable.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So matter of fact,
if you look at a lot

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Greek
historians, they always

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:84%
refer to the people from
the time of Atlantis

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and before Atlantis
as the ancient ones.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of writings
about the ancient ones that

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.830 align:middle line:84%
was at Alexandria
that's just now gone.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just forever
lost to humanity.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we believe is that,
before 13,000 years ago,

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
there was an intelligent race
of humans that were highly

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:90%
technologically advanced.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And they created facilities
across the globe.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:90%
If you look at a lot of--

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
look, if you look at
Pumapunku and if you

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
look at ancient Egypt, and
you do a lot of comparisons--

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:84%
also, with the Incan
and Mayan ruins--

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
if you do a lot of comparisons
of the architecture,

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.315 align:middle line:90%
the similarities are striking.

00:29:38.315 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're astounding.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how could people
across an entire planet,

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
have technology

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.278 align:middle line:90%
to create such architecture?

00:29:50.278 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
how do you explain

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
some of these ancient
carvings we just

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:84%
looked at, with the GMR
section, where you could clearly

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
see what looks like
an alien being waving

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:90%
with a spaceship over his head?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Who would come up with that
20, 30, 40,000 years ago?

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Remember,
when we looked

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:84%
at-- when we looked
at-- all you need to do

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.653 align:middle line:90%
is look at the Sumerians.

00:30:13.653 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
at their culture,

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.776 align:middle line:84%
and we look at a lot
of the cuneiform--

00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:18.576 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tablets?

00:30:18.576 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --clay tablets that
were found in southern Iraq--

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:84%
going all the way
back to the 1840s,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
when they were first discovered
by Western archaeologists--

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what they wrote
was about the Anunnaki,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:90%
who were not of this Earth.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
most people-- that's

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
why we don't learn about
the Anunnaki in our schools.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught
about the Anunnaki.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
great course that--

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We're not
talking about the Sumerians.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be a great course.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't it?

00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And we're not taught
about the Sumerian culture.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:90%
It's overlooked.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that has to do
with politics and religion

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of our modern
academic institutions are based

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
on ones that were
created-- going back 1,000,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years ago--

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.580 align:middle line:84%
which were founded
on religion and then,

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, political
ideologies that just don't want

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to have anything to do with
Sumerians, who contradict

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit of
what we were taught

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:90%
in both religions in schools.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
so many mysteries

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, Anthony,
that we have barely scratched

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:90%
the surface of what's going on.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But with great researchers,
like you and the late Jim Marrs,

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe we're going to get
these answers, eventually.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: What's going
to happen when Antarctica

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:90%
becomes--

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When it really melts?

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: When
it starts to melt?

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
saying that there is--

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the Russians
just discovered a lake.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's some five
miles beneath of ice,

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:90%
or two miles beneath the ice.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
A freshwater lake that
was untouched for millions

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of years, and they say
that they're already

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
discovering species down
there that we have--

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That we have
no idea what they were.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: No.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
But who's to say--

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's our planet.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.863 align:middle line:84%
And who's to say that
there weren't vestiges

00:32:07.863 --> 00:32:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of humanity that,
at one time, existed

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:90%
on Antarctica a long time ago?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.137 align:middle line:84%
Let's say 20,000 years
ago, 50,000 years ago.

00:32:17.137 --> 00:32:18.720 align:middle line:84%
What's that going
to tell us about who

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
we are today, when the earliest
known form of writing that we

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
know about emanates from
the cradle of civilization,

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.813 align:middle line:84%
the Tigris and Euphrates,
via the Sumerians,

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
who they don't teach
us about in school?

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we know,
obviously, we've been visited.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's clear that just
with the artifacts that are

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:90%
out there, we've been visited.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The big question is, are
we still being visited,

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.618 align:middle line:90%
or are they here among us now?

00:32:45.618 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I like to think
they're still here among us.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:90%
We had been visited--

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:84%
we had been visited,
and I think they're

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:90%
here-- they're still here.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a
lot of the research

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that's been done based
on people of today who

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
claim to have been abducted
by gray aliens, who

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
claim to have seen
orbs, who claim to have

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:90%
seen massive tubes in the sky.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
People that undergo
memory regression

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and give incredible
detail about situations

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:84%
that they found
themselves in with people

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:90%
that are not of this Earth--

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.750 align:middle line:84%
beings that are
not of this Earth.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.032 align:middle line:84%
And the similarities
of the stories.

00:33:25.032 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
disparate communities

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
across the globe,
individuals who

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
don't share the same language,
giving the same details

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:90%
about what happened to them.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It makes you wonder,
is it really happening?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.800 align:middle line:90%
I think the answer is yes.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
grays on this planet.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
other alien communities.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I've had conversations
with Linda Moulton Howe,

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and she's made it quite clear to
me that, through her contacts--

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
very high-level contacts-- that
there are other alien species

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.613 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it
appear that there's

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:84%
a suppression of information
from the UFO community?

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We have
to ask ourselves,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
why are these wonderful groups,
like MUFON and various others,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:84%
being staffed with
ex-FBI, ex-CIA--

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plants.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:90%
They're plants.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.335 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Are they plants?

00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:84%
Are they there to
espouse disinformation?

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they there to
hide various elements

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:84%
of the data that's
been collected

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
over the many, many
years from the public?

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm
actually leading up

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.591 align:middle line:84%
an effort trying to put
together a non-profit to start

00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:33.049 align:middle line:84%
something that's
free to everybody,

00:34:33.049 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that no one has
to pay a dime for.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.159 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to join, other
than give your email address.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have direct
access to tools

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to research the history of UFOs
and alien abduction phenomena

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth using a global
connected network of tools

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:90%
available to everybody.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would computers
play a role in that?

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:55.269 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:34:55.269 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually building
servers across the globe

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:84%
right now for a new project
I'm doing called UFO Nexus.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to allow
people to communicate online,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in real time, and see where
UFO sightings are appearing

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:90%
on the planet--

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Connected worldwide.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:10.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Worldwide.

00:35:10.405 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:90%
A worldwide network.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.528 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great idea.

00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:90%
What about abductions?

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Would they be
added to that, too?

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Same thing.

00:35:14.405 --> 00:35:15.205 align:middle line:90%
Abductions, yeah.

00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So reported abductions,
reported sightings.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have a whole list

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of other types of
supernatural and UFO

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and alien-based scenarios that
can play out that will appear

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO Nexus network.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and I go to
a lot of UFO conferences.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you think some of them
are infiltrated by CIA

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:90%
or secret government people?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I do.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, I was at
an event, and I

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
was speaking with Janet
Saylor, who had the ASB

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:90%
organization in New Mexico.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.055 align:middle line:90%
And it was a great event.

00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I met a lot of
good people there.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rita Louise was there,
and a whole bunch of people

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:90%
in the community.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Stan Friedman was there.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And we were--

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love the guy.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.012 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We were having
a discussion on Dulce,

00:36:04.012 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and there was a strange
couple that had approached me

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and they
asked me if I wanted

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to leave the
conference to go appear

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
at their-- they had a
television studio there in town.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.912 align:middle line:84%
And Janet was-- she
overheard what was happening,

00:36:19.912 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and she looked at
me and she said--

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.287 align:middle line:84%
she gave me these hand
signals like, don't you

00:36:23.287 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:90%
dare leave with these people.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And they were very persistent.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: And ultimately--

00:36:28.765 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were they
going to do with you?

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So Janet and several
other people came over,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and they kind of intervened.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And Janet said, there
is no television studio

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.410 align:middle line:90%
in Angelfall in New Mexico.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: There's no-- she
goes, who are you people?

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.745 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And they became
kind of confrontational.

00:36:46.745 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And then they just left.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And Janet said--

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
want to kidnap you?

00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I don't know
about kidnap, but maybe--

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, George.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just, were they
from the military?

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what we surmised.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.002 align:middle line:84%
That's what we thought
of at the event.

00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We said maybe these
were people who

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:84%
were unhappy with what I
was sharing about this Dulce

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:84%
facility at this
particular conference.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were there
to tell me, hey,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:84%
you better not go
up and speak about--

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --the facility.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without being direct.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And we do know that
there are people

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that attend MUFON meetings,
and various other groups that

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.342 align:middle line:90%
put on conferences.

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're
infiltrating--

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
MUFON, Mutual UFO Network?

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: MUFON is
a great organization.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
been infiltrated?

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.193 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: A lot of people
believe they have been.

00:37:33.193 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you?

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I do.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that, at times,
MUFON has been infiltrated

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:90%
by various government entities.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we
know that MUFON--

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.687 align:middle line:84%
do you recall the
NIDS program they had?

00:37:45.687 --> 00:37:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.268 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And a lot of people
felt that that was some sort

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:90%
of a compromised--

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that the government
was just too involved

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:84%
in MUFON, which
should have nothing

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to do with the government,
on the surface.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then Bigelow has strong
ties to the military industrial

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He does.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.033 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: And I don't know--

00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I think
he's the real deal.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, he
is the real deal.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
anything negative has ever

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:84%
come about through the
so-called infiltration of groups

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:90%
like MUFON.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the suppression of
some information, but not

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:90%
all information.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Because so much has come
out of groups like MUFON.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of friends who
are investigators within MUFON,

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and they do an amazing job.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where
does all this head?

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.657 align:middle line:90%
Where is it leading?

00:38:28.657 --> 00:38:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, we have the
suppression of information,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
we have chaos happening
in the low Earth

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.760 align:middle line:84%
orbit with the
weaponization of space.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.170 align:middle line:90%
We have suppression of ideas.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we have
shows like "Beyond Belief,"

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.303 align:middle line:90%
"Ancient Aliens."

00:38:45.303 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:84%
We have the old
"UFO Hunters" show

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Birnes
that are doing things

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:84%
like pushing the information
that they don't want out there

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And great
podcasts, too,

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.435 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of dedicated people.

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Jimmy Church is a--

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, Jimmy's my buddy.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.192 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Connie Willis.

00:39:01.192 --> 00:39:03.165 align:middle line:84%
The two of them have
some great podcasts.

00:39:03.165 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And there are--

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of them as
little mini George Noorys.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:84%
They get out there and they
just put the truth out there,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and they ask the hard questions.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And they don't pull any punches.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And the information that
ends up out in the public

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:84%
is, a lot of times, what's
trying to be suppressed by--

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.550 align:middle line:84%
the information that's trying
to be suppressed by the powers

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:90%
that be.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, and what
I think we need to do,

00:39:25.815 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Anthony, and we're doing
it, is to give people

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.890 align:middle line:84%
like that the vehicle
to get their word out

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:90%
so people can hear them.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may not have 50
people listening to a certain

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:90%
podcast--

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --at any given time.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But when Connie comes
on, or Jimmy does,

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:84%
they've got a platform
of millions of people,

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:90%
and they get that word out.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.245 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:39:46.245 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or when you're on,
talking about the UFO highway.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a huge audience
night for us, and for you.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us researchers
are grateful to you, George,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and to your entire
team of people that

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:90%
are just making this possible.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm hopeful,
and thankful to companies

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:84%
like Gaia, who
invest a lot of money

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to get the answers out to
these great mysteries that

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:90%
are surrounding all of us.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get that
kind of opportunity

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
in many other places to be
able to just get the word out

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.033 align:middle line:84%
about all these
incredible mysteries.

00:40:23.033 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think this
heads for all of us, though?

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.810 align:middle line:90%
What's the end game here?

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Ultimately,
I think that we're

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
looking at a new future that
is unlike anything that we

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.478 align:middle line:90%
could even imagine.

00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I like to believe that,
because technology

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:84%
has evolved exponentially,
from just a short time ago,

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's affecting humanity
on a level that none of us

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:90%
are capable of imagining.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.760 align:middle line:84%
By 2020, they think
that the average person

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.190 align:middle line:84%
is going to have more
conversations with bot

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.190 align:middle line:90%
technology than actual humans.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We are already interfacing
with artificial intelligence

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.960 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
How many households
across the globe

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
have this new technology,
these little devices

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:90%
that they speak to?

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So are we transforming
as a species?

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And with all of
the climate change,

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is somebody
terraforming our planet?

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Is that a possibility?

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.375 align:middle line:90%
Where does this all lead?

00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a hard
question to answer,

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be unlike
anything we could imagine.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take a moment and look
at that camera directly right

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:84%
over my shoulder, and talk
to the people watching

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
this program right
now, who may be

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:84%
concerned about their future
and their children's future.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I think that,
if we could come together

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:84%
as a collective group
of like-minded thinkers

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
hoping for a positive outcome,
we could make it happen.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
power of intention.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, with all the
negativity that is out there,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:84%
it takes just a handful of
us to come together and think

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.460 align:middle line:84%
on a whole other
plane of positivity

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that the
future for our children

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
wonderful place,

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.903 align:middle line:84%
and not something
that's negative.

00:42:19.903 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Anthony.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.418 align:middle line:84%
Are you concerned
about your own safety--

00:42:23.418 --> 00:42:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I used to be--

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --at this point?

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --when I started
delving into black budget

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:90%
projects, these black projects.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I never thought that people
would actually come to my house

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and ask me to stop
doing what I was doing.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.362 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I'd
get these phone calls.

00:42:38.362 --> 00:42:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I actually had my
house broken into

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and all my hard
drives were stolen.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Everything was left,
but my hard drives were stolen.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They won't
stop at anything.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: No.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:84%
That had to do with
their project lead-in.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't want
me talking about that.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But thank god for Linda,
it's at her site now.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you seem
to keep going forward.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Have to.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't stop.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.068 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: You have to.

00:42:57.068 --> 00:42:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Look at Jim Morris.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:90%
He never stopped.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I don't want to stop.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
say to new researchers?

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Young people who want
to get into what you do.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.520 align:middle line:10%
Listen, I think that the
future of the UFO community

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.320 align:middle line:10%
hinges on a youth effort.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:10%
We need young people to
take a strong interest

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:10%
in what most people
have tried to shame

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:10%
over the last 20 to 30 years.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of UFO technology
and alien abduction phenomena

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
as something for Hollywood.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
actually affected a lot of us

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:90%
in real life.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And I know that a
lot of young people out there,

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:84%
they've succumbed
to a lot of this.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
the youth effort is

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
what's going to propel the
future of the UFO research

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a
young boy in Detroit,

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I would go out to the
night sky with my telescope

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
planets and the moon.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would look up
at the stars, Anthony,

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and I would try to will
a UFO to come down.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Never happened.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.140 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they did it later.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:05.545 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: It's funny
how the universe works.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe it didn't
happen at that moment,

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:84%
like you wanted,
but you ended up

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
becoming the voice of
the entire UFO community?

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Anthony, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Thank
you so much, George.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.732 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Isn't it great
to have researchers

00:44:20.732 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:10%
like Anthony Sanchez, author of
"The UFO Highway," who go out

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:10%
and spend their careers, and
put their lives on the line,

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.830 align:middle line:10%
to get us information about
what's really happening

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.710 align:middle line:10%
on this planet and up there?

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:45.014 align:middle line:90%
