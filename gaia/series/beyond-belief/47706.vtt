00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.932 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: The mysterious
creature: half man, half ape.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We know him as Bigfoot,
Sasquatch, or Yeti.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:90%
And where does he live?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:90%
What does he eat?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Hunters and researchers comb
the forests and mountains

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
in hopes of a glimpse of
this mysterious creature.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He seems to be one step
ahead at all times.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will
we ever capture him?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:10%
The hunt for Bigfoot
has fascinated all of us

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:10%
for so many years.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:10%
It has fascinated Rhettman
Mullis, who at the age of 10

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:10%
had his first encounter,
and he never forgot it.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.842 align:middle line:10%
And that has pushed your
whole career, hasn't it?

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.175 align:middle line:10%
>> RHETTMAN MULLIS: Yes, it has.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:10%
You know, you live your life.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:10%
After that, I was still
growing up, went in the Navy,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:10%
went to college, went to
college, went in the Navy,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:10%
went back to college, got
married, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And then became an engineer.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:10%
But over time, went into
the field of psychology,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:10%
became a professor
and psychologist.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.385 align:middle line:10%
But that's always been in the
background: the curiosity.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:10%
Especially whenever
you go in the woods

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.565 align:middle line:10%
and you still have
stuff happening,

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't leave you.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I've seen two Bigfoots, one
in 1977 swimming, and the one

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
in '97, where she was
sitting in a quarry pond,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.114 align:middle line:84%
and we chased her in the woods
for about an hour after that.

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I get asked every
once in a while,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:10%
what would you have done
if you had caught her?

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Are they fast?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.014 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: Very fast.

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
We actually have them clocked
running through the woods

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.452 align:middle line:10%
at 35 miles an hour.

00:01:54.452 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're quite fast,
and they're quite agile.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.243 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's funny
you say that, Rhettman.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
When my little boy
was about 10 and we

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
lived with a house that backed
to the woods in St. Louis,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
he, with his buddy,
he claims he saw

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:84%
something that could
have been Bigfoot.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, now
that he's an adult,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to explain or try to
remember what he saw.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Dad, all I
know is it wasn't a person.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear it
running through the woods.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I caught a
glimpse of it, and it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
scared the living
daylights out of me."

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a little eight
or ten-year-old kid.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.355 align:middle line:84%
Might he have seen something
there in the woods of Missouri?

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.605 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Very realistically.

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
because they're bipedal,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a definite
difference in the padding run

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.284 align:middle line:84%
of a biped as opposed to
quadruped, like a bear.

00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: So you
can pull that out,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:90%
even for the common person.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
When I coach people-- I used
to do a lot of coaching.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you want to
go have an experience,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:90%
this is what you need to do.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And part that coaching
was telling them

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
take kids out with you.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Take your wife out with you.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Have fun.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Sing.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Do it around the campfire.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But just be cognitive of
what's going on around you.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.614 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Be careful.

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:09.364 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: Because
what happens is though,

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:11.822 align:middle line:10%
they're walking through the
woods and come across something

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:10%
that interests them.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So what they'll do is
they generally get down

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.834 align:middle line:84%
on all fours, or even crawl
into a site, watch for a while.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they're usually
seen is when they get bored

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.333 align:middle line:90%
and they stand up and walk away.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They saw what they want.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.322 align:middle line:84%
But children tend
to bring them in,

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
women tend to bring them
in, and that's mainaly

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
because of the pheromone
aspect of their bodies

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and their nonaggressive appeal.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's very common to
have children see them

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.721 align:middle line:84%
even though the parents
weren't paying attention.

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they steal?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Do they take things
from the camp grounds?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.991 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Oh yeah.

00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:10%
They're what I call an
opportunistic eater.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:10%
They are somewhat scavenger-ish.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:10%
We've gone down trails where
the nearest house was miles away

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:10%
and found bags that were stolen.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:10%
And they were ripping
open the bags,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:10%
pulling stuff out as they're
walking down obscure trails.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We found toys miles away
from the nearest house

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
or daycare that
were strewn about.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I still have toys
to this day where--

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.823 align:middle line:84%
like a plastic basketball with
this big incisor tooth bitten

00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They chewed it.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Oh yeah, all
kinds of stuff like that.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they
think it was food?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: I don't
know what they thought.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So to you and I we'd
go, that's plastic.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a Nerf football.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't look
appealing to me.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
been chewed on.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But if they become
familiarized with you,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:90%
they'll do gifts exchange.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And like for example, out on the
Lummi Reservation, a gentleman

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
we were work with named Jim, he
was working with a small family

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
group on a property
that he was living on.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And he started giving
them rice and honey.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would leave him
things like a coyote skull.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I actually still
have pictures of it.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A little trade out?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yeah.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.281 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting about
the coyote skulls, because you

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
know how bone is very rough?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
This had been handled
so much that the wax

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
build-up on the bone
made it look smooth.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.219 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
interesting, and we

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
were able to identify
that as coyote.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's very common
for them to gift.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that gives you
the impression there's some

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
intelligence behind
these creatures.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: There is some.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
There is some.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It's still a primitive
intelligence.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And once you start realizing--

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Caveman type?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.624 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Once you start
realizing it's a very primitive

00:05:15.624 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
caveman type intelligence, it
also helps a person understand

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%
their behavior.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:10%
Like for example, we see a
lot of videos or pictures

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:10%
where they think they're
hiding behind a tree.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:10%
But they're-- well,
that's juvenile behavior.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: They're
bigger than the tree.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: They're
bigger than the tree,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.536 align:middle line:10%
but they think they're hiding,
just like a child does when

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:33.437 align:middle line:10%
playing peak-a-boo.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:34.895 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Ha ha,
you can't find me.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:37.749 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: They can't see you,
but they think they can't-- you

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:10%
can't see them, even though you
can still see their shoulders

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:10%
So it is a very
primitive intelligence.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Smarter than most animals?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.295 align:middle line:90%
Smarter than man?

00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.003 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What you think
we're talking about here?

00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
What is this creature?

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: My thinking has
evolved over the years.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '90s, I worked
with Dr. Grover Krantz out

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
of Washington State
University, and I

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
used to collect
evidence for him.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And he had the
Gigantopithecus theory.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.282 align:middle line:90%
So I did hold that for a while.

00:06:07.282 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is an
ape-like creature, right?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: It's an extinct ape.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But over time when
I started learning

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
more about the indigenous
tribes' lore of them

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.965 align:middle line:84%
mating with human
females, it made

00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:22.847 align:middle line:84%
me realize they had to be
closer to humans genetically.

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.549 align:middle line:90%
For it to work, right?

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:90%
So I evolved that thinking.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, in my mind,
it can't be a Gigantopithecus.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to be some
other form of closer

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:90%
relic or sub-genus human.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
trying to figure out

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
now with all this DNA
research that we're doing.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some people have
called it dimensional.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Other people have called
them extraterrestrial.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think that they are
some species from this planet.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: There's nothing--
I know there's what we call

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:90%
a cult following now.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
making outlandish claims

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
is, because we don't have
a species in captivity

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
or a species that we
can monitor and watch,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
people can make any claim
they want, and you can't say,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
well, that's not true.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like in science, we
can say anything we want,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
but we still can't say
that's 100% true either.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So people are out there
making wild claims

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
about these animals that
don't exist anywhere

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
else in any other of the
species of the world,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.235 align:middle line:90%
no matter what that species is.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I've
seen two of them.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I've had a couple hundred
plus interactions now

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
over the last 37 years
with these things.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
paranormal about them.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They're just regular flesh
and blood-- whatever they are.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when somebody says,
I saw a UFO with them.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's nice.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, they cloak.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's nice, too.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Klingons cloak, too, but I
don't believe in Klingons,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I believe in Bigfoot.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, actually,
one of our team members

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is Pearl Hoda, she had
one cloak in front of her.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So she's adamant that
they're able to cloak.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And she's been
trying to prove that.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
She's actually writing a
book right now about it.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I
love her and think

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.671 align:middle line:84%
she's a great woman--
she's our historian--

00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
we are great-- we are friends.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.412 align:middle line:84%
She knows I don't
agree with that.

00:08:13.412 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
other explanations,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.786 align:middle line:84%
especially from a
psychological point of view,

00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:90%
how I can explain these things.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But until we actually have
that set of documented Bigfoot,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
saying this is what they are.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.692 align:middle line:90%
We know they die.

00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We know they've been shot at.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.066 align:middle line:90%
We know they've been killed.

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:35.336 align:middle line:84%
We know that-- we think
we found burial mounds,

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot of red tape
to be able to get in there

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and excavate them.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
If they were ethereal, being
able to shape-shift, cloak,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
go into other dimensions,
then why are they dying?

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Why do they die?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Why do they get sick?

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.894 align:middle line:90%
Why do they die and rot?

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And there can't
be too many of them.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: No, there's not.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
to put a number on it.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people estimate
into the millions.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Some people estimate 10,000.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I take a more
realistic approach.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I was actually pressed upon
that about a decade ago.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We'd have more
sightings right now if we had

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:90%
that many.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.363 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: We have
a lot of sightings,

00:09:10.363 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is most
people, again, are autocentric.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.027 align:middle line:90%
They only focus on here.

00:09:15.027 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
really pay attention

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on besides that.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.446 align:middle line:84%
So even when they're
hiking around,

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
they'll get a
whiff of something.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They'll feel like they're being
looked, they're being watched.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.645 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't do
is they don't look up.

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they tend to be up,
they could be up in the trees

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
depending on their size
and size of the trees.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
They could be up on
a hillside somewhere.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Being that they're a
apex predator, that

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
means they more than likely
have a high acuity of vision,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
a high acuity of smell,
and so on and so forth,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
which means-- I kind
of make a joke of it.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Like we're out
looking at a river

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.416 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
like Suiattle River

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:90%
area of Washington.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say, here we are.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:90%
We're looking out going, wow.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.112 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful trees.

00:09:53.112 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful mountainside.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Look at the river below.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The Bigfoot's over
on the other side

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:90%
going, that guy has green eyes.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.698 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a-- there's no
way to really prove that,

00:10:01.698 --> 00:10:04.982 align:middle line:84%
but it's just kind of a joke
showing that's how more keen

00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
they are, in terms of they're
being able to perceive,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:90%
over us.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we've
developed this world

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
where we don't have to rely
on our senses so much anymore.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.994 align:middle line:84%
So we've lost some of
that sense ability.

00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's been documented
that people have been

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from parks,
state parks specifically,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Yellowstone in particular,
and also Yosemite.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.747 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot?

00:10:27.747 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Something's happening
to these people.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.496 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Could be Bigfoot.

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
other predators.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were talking
about cult following earlier.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Another cult following
is they believe

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that they can identify
guns and cameras and stuff.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.645 align:middle line:84%
Every situation I've
ever had in the woods,

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:48.667 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying, because
there's other things

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to worry about even
more than Bigfoot.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Lions and
tigers and bears.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.129 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: And the feral man,
or your drug dealers out there

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:90%
growing their marijuana fields.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who doesn't
want to see you out there.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yeah.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
So you have to protect yourself.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I've always been armed.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, a lot of
people on our team are armed.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Not because we
want to kill them.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.088 align:middle line:90%
We have no intention of that.

00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's for
personal protection.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.637 align:middle line:84%
But that's never hindered
us from having sightings.

00:11:13.637 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
most sightings actually

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
occur with hunters
who are armed.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.637 align:middle line:10%
And they'll kill a deer and
even have their deer taken

00:11:20.637 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:10%
by the Bigfoot before they can--

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: How many of
those hunters will shoot

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:10%
at their Bigfoot sighting?

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.524 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Rare.

00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's good.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But some will?

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.806 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: We have a guy on
our team named Richard Turner.

00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:90%
He's a 40, 50-year hunter.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And he actually has
this famous story

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
where he had one in his
sight, in his scope.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:10%
And he debated, am I
going to shoot this?

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:10%
Because he could see her face.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:10%
And he looked down, there was
a youngling on her nipple.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:10%
And he kept going back
and forth going, I can't.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Because facial-wise,
they're so human.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
easily identify

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
someone who's doing a
hoax and someone's not.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, you were
talking about the 2008 hoax

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I was sent a picture
of that by a friend.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.424 align:middle line:84%
And it took me all of three
seconds to go, that's a hoax.

00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Because in the picture
of the freezer,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
they had a gorilla ape,
which is a flat nose.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoots have human
face, which means

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.372 align:middle line:84%
they have hooded
noses like ours.

00:12:11.372 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They can be different
shapes, sure.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:90%
But they're still hooded noses.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at their face
and we see that they have ears,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
they have a nose, they have
a mouth, and they have eyes,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and they have whites--

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You think twice about
shooting something like that.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.515 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Another team
member we had named Tim Olson,

00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:29.095 align:middle line:84%
who's out of
northern California,

00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
he documented a story
about the Orleans story,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
where a girl was mushroom
hunting in the woods.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And she found this mushroom
bed that had been torn up.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was unusual,
because she's

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
used to seeing beer and
dear-- deer and bear do it,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
but it was kind
of an unusual way.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking at it,
and she heard something.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
She looks up, and
there's a female.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And the female she described
had kaleidoscope eyes,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.769 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a hazely
eyes, which shows us also

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that they have an
array of eye color,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
just like an array
of hair color.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And she also had a youngling.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.869 align:middle line:84%
And the way they in, in a
difficult situation like that,

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
the way they keep the
younglings quiet is they'll

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
put the youngling on their
breast to keep it quiet.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And they'll take
shelter in the trees.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And she finally, the
woman, the female Bigfoot

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:90%
was looking up this way.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And she caught the
eye of the adult male.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And then she started
running, and the adult male

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.544 align:middle line:84%
started swinging down
out of the trees.

00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:30.329 align:middle line:84%
And one swift movement,
chased after her.

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:90%
They could've caught her.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.474 align:middle line:84%
But he was just chasing
her away, obviously.

00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:10%
She got in her car with
a couple other people,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:10%
and they were literally
driving as fast they can

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:10%
up this dirt road,
35, 40 miles an hour.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:10%
And it was keeping pace
with her in the woods

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:10%
alongside the road.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:10%
So she, to this day,
my understanding

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:10%
is she still doesn't want
to go back up in there.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:10%
But that's not an unusual story.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:10%
So it happens quite a bit.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Tell me about
your 1997 sighting.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: I have this joke that
I see a Bigfoot every 20 years.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:10%
So I don't think I'll see
the next one until 2017.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:10%
But in 1997, we were
investigating an old story.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
My research partner,
Gary Holman-- in fact

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
who's an old Inuit
Indian-- his sister was

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
a caretaker at the Tule Indian
Reservation for a quarry

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
pond that wasn't used
anymore, a quarry site.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.125 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that what
we're looking at there?

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Ah, yes, exactly.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a PowerPoint I did.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:90%
She lived in the mobile home.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
set of trees that

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
would be east of
the mobile home.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And that green part
of the brown road

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
is where the tree had a
canopy, it was a canopy cover.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.242 align:middle line:84%
And she'd given the story that
they would come up and slap

00:14:45.242 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
her mobile home, look in the
windows, which is very common.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Shake it.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Shake it.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we got out and we started
walking down that covered dirt

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
road part, where the
green showing the canopy.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And I got that heavy,
musky whiff smell.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the tree
line to the north,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:90%
where there's nothing there.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And nothing was there, so
I walked across the street

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to where you see the
little blue circles are.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I found two of the biggest
nesting areas I'd ever seen.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And it had a smell,
but it looked old,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.784 align:middle line:84%
which fell in line with
the sister's story,

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because she said
the last time she

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
had any interaction was
about a year before.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was a beautiful
summer, Washington day,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:90%
so we just decided to walk down.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.373 align:middle line:84%
She was going to show us in the
quarry pond, where she usually

00:15:29.373 --> 00:15:30.976 align:middle line:90%
sees them drinking and sitting.

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Gosh.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
She must be seeing
a lot of them.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.696 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yeah.

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:36.315 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked down and
did that 90 degree turn.

00:15:36.315 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a big out
building there,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.176 align:middle line:90%
and there's the quarry pond.

00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
line of trees

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
on the south side
of that quarry pond.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's that
little red spot, by the way?

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: The red
spot, the big one,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
was a big blackberry or
raspberry bush that sat

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And then past that was a
bunch of water lilies, lily

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:90%
pads and stuff.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The smaller red
dot is-- but just

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
as we got past
that out building,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
we're all just chatting.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.663 align:middle line:84%
I had my girlfriend
there and her son,

00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:90%
and the sister and Gary Holman.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:11.345 align:middle line:84%
And Gary, he's like, he was 63
at the time-- spry, spry, guy.

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he bends
down and yells, look at that.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And we all turn our
head, and we see

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.294 align:middle line:84%
this female, the little red
dot, sitting in the quarry pond.

00:16:20.294 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I originally thought she
was there cleaning herself.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized is, because
they're cold weather creatures,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.262 align:middle line:84%
we see a lot of
stories like this,

00:16:28.262 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
where they're sitting in
the pond, sitting in a swamp

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
to try and stay cool.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she
saw us and we saw her,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the most
elegant movements.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
She just stood right
up, and just turned,

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and walked behind
that blackberry bush,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:90%
just very gracefully.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not afraid?

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Not afraid, just
very calmly-- which is typical,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:90%
again, Bigfoot behavior.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
They're always-- they
see a human, they vacate.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And so she started the trek.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.434 align:middle line:84%
I drew the trek
line in to where she

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
walked through the quarry pond
behind the blackberry bush,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:90%
whatever that bush was.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And the blackberry
bush, we measured.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%
It was like 9-feet tall.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And she was about a foot under.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.301 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So about 8 feet?

00:17:09.301 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: About 8 feet.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But then again, she was
also sitting in the water.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't measure
into the water.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And so Jerry and I
ran around that pond,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and we saw her going
into the woods right

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the swamp
area there, the lily pads.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that road there,
and I told Jerry, stay there.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And I ran back to my
Jeep, drove around,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:90%
and picked him up at that road.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And we continued, we
found a dirt road path

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.684 align:middle line:90%
going through the trees there.

00:17:37.684 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had special
sound equipment.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.482 align:middle line:84%
And we were tracking her
for an hour after that.

00:17:42.482 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
We never saw her again after
that, but we could still hear.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.734 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I told Jerry,
I said hold your breath,

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
tell if it's her--

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:90%
[HEAVY BREATHING]

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.944 align:middle line:84%
--or if it's us, because
we're all excited about this.

00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:90%
So we held our breath.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
snap, crackle, pop;

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
it was like a freight train
going through the woods.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And so we kept track of her.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.269 align:middle line:84%
And we finally lost her where
they had clear cut this area.

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She was out of there.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.768 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: And what's
interesting is if anybody knows

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that area, you can Google that
area of Marysville, Washington.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And what you find now
is Walmart, the casinos.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Everything's
knocked down.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Everything.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a clear cut
area that we lost her in,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.658 align:middle line:84%
which just shows the point and
proves the point that I tell

00:18:19.658 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
people is, you don't have
to go out of town very

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
far in many instances
to have encounters

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.365 align:middle line:90%
with these creatures.

00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you saying
Bigfoot shops at Walmart?

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
commercial for that.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: I don't know if
you've ever seen those Walmart

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.085 align:middle line:84%
pictures, but there's some
people in there you kind

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of scratch your head
going what is that?

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
But no, that was a lot of fun.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, that was one of
those, people have asked me,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
well, what would you have
done if you caught her?

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.252 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:44.252 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
think about that.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would they
have fought you if you--?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.466 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:18:48.466 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They would.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever tried
to communicate verbally

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:90%
with a Bigfoot, or gestures?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you had waved,
would it have waved back?

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.152 align:middle line:84%
Does it know that
much to do that?

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: I've tried to
communicate with them.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
When I know that they're around,
I will speak out to them.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of the
different Indian tribes

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, they
like to do the same thing,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.059 align:middle line:84%
try to speak to them, make
them feel comfortable,

00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:90%
familiar with them.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
ever talk back?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.031 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Oh yeah.

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:90%
We'll do calls back and forth.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.714 align:middle line:84%
We'll do whistles
back and forth.

00:19:20.714 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
have a language?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: Oh yes,
definitely have a language.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:10%
We know they have a language.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.053 align:middle line:10%
They have a culture.

00:19:25.053 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:10%
They have a sociology.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:10%
I started talking about
this many, many years ago.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.152 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
anecdotal evidence

00:19:32.152 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:90%
they like to bury their dead.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We found those burial
mounds, we think,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.011 align:middle line:90%
that we need to excavate.

00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they sound
human-like when they speak?

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.809 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yeah, very gibberish.

00:19:40.809 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
that are doing excellent work

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
at trying to understand
what they're saying,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
picking up certain dialects
like certain Native American,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:90%
certain--

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.481 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:53.395 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have those
sounds been recorded?

00:19:53.395 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Yeah,
sounds were recorded.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We have several people that
do excellent sound analyses.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Paul Graves does an excellent
work in sound analysis.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Ron Morehead.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
They did the Sierra sounds.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
best set of sounds,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
we have a team member out
of Texas, Bob Trakowski,

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:90%
an excellent tech guy.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And he goes out to the
Trinity River area of Texas.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And he'll sit there on a
lawn chair with apples,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.538 align:middle line:84%
and he'll sit there
all night long.

00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually recorded
the most clear recordings

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard in my life.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.936 align:middle line:90%
And I can get those for you.

00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
screams or talk?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Talk.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
He's actually extrapolated from
the dialogue between a mother

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and a daughter, even the
daughter's name, Iggy.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one, I think
it's a boy, he has his name.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.927 align:middle line:84%
And he's got them recording,
having yelling back and forth,

00:20:39.927 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
a-la-la-la-la, with
their gibberish talking.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.614 align:middle line:90%
Iggy stop, or Iggy ba.

00:20:44.614 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You can hear that?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.985 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:20:46.985 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's as clear as you
and I are talking.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.308 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, that's amazing.

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: And Bob
does excellent work.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.857 align:middle line:10%
But he's got calls, some of the
best audio work I've ever heard

00:20:57.857 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:10%
has come out of Bob.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And there are a lot
of good audio people

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:10%
out there, don't get me wrong.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
There's excellent audio people.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
What you see here is actually
a very common depiction,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in native drawings,
indigenous people drawing,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:90%
or this is a totem pole.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
form of the lips.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
One of their typical
calls is the woo call.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Woo-ooo-ooo, like that.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
shape of their lips

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that they make when
they make that woo call.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how
many totems you'll

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
find in all the different
types of tribals.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You can see there,
she has breasts.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But I believe they use very
similar to like coyotes

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and wolves, they
have locator calls,

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:84%
like the one, the screamer
that I had in Coupeville,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:84%
when I lived on
Whidbey Island in '98.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:90%
That was a screamer.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that was kind
of a locator call, which

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
it starts real low and it goes
real high It goes, woo-ooo-oop.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.779 align:middle line:90%
It'll do whoops, it'll go whoop.

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: What are
they trying to do?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: I think you're
just trying to locate.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Another one?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.206 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: Yeah.

00:21:56.206 --> 00:22:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Because they don't have--
can I tell you a funny story?

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.645 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:01.415 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: OK.

00:22:01.415 --> 00:22:03.737 align:middle line:10%
You know about the
swimming Bigfoot in '77?

00:22:03.737 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: OK, I was living in
Oak Harbor when I was a kid.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.759 align:middle line:84%
And I used to walk
through the woods

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to go fishing all the
time, because I lived

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
in an unlisted cape
part on the island.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading about
Bigfoot after I saw him.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was told by Bill
Cosby, on his recordings,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that if you whistle, it
scares the monsters away.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I walked through
that track of woods, I would--

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLING]

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:90%
--whistle.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Later, as I started researching
these things even more,

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that when they
trek through the woods,

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
they don't go side by--
they don't go single file.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.495 align:middle line:90%
They go parallel.

00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This is while
they'll, as they're

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.087 align:middle line:84%
going through the
woods, they'll whistle

00:22:43.087 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of
themselves as they're

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.666 align:middle line:90%
going through the woods.

00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't until later
that I learned all that

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and I realized, oh, I was really
just kind of whistling them in.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was--

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He knows our language.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.319 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: --counterintuitive.

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, we know all
the different sounds

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:10%
that they make.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The woo calls, the whoop
calls, the screams.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the Oak Harbor
Bigfoot that woke everybody up

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
at 1:30 in the morning.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How'd he wake him up?

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: They were screaming.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
doing screams calls,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not going
to mimic because I'll

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:90%
blow out a vocal chord.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And we went back the next
day to track them down.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
We went out there that night.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.484 align:middle line:84%
Oak Harbor, after the
sun goes down, it's dead.

00:23:25.484 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a little,
little island town.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All you
can see is stars.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.838 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Right.

00:23:28.838 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And so we got called at 1:30.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And we drove down there.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.037 align:middle line:84%
We're only a mile away
from this location.

00:23:34.037 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
By the time we got down there,
there was so much traffic

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
down there, you'd think it
was rush hour in Seattle.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we went
back the next day.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.844 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to think of
it, because back then, I

00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:90%
was an engineer.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.593 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to think of
acoustically in the valley

00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
where they would be
to carry that call.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And we narrowed in on this site.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And we went down to the trailer.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.117 align:middle line:84%
It's that little green
square on the left there.

00:23:57.117 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We went down to that trailer,
and we talked to that guy.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I still have the
recording somewhere.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
we heard the call.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was the
coyotes that are in the area.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:10%
But there was such a different
and louder sound that he got

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:10%
dressed, and walked down
his little dirt road there

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:10%
towards-- that's Taylor road
there, the main blacktop--

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.095 align:middle line:10%
and walked across,
and he kept listening

00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:10%
to these things screaming.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's pitch black.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no lighting out there.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And he walked all
the way up to where

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:84%
it's like a little U
driveway-- some trees,

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and then that big white patch--
it was a high grass field.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.289 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the grass was
a good 4 and 1/2, 5 feet tall,

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:90%
as tall as the fence was.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great place to hide.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: It came up
to like here on me.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there's a
little garden patch,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that little tiny bluish-green
square in that round area.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the house up above.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And all that is
forest around that.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to track
them coming out of the woods,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
going behind that
house, crossing

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that little gravel
road, the driveway.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.606 align:middle line:90%
They had big sit down areas.

00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
It was really kind of cool,
because they sat down--

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like a family?

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: And two big adults,
they sat down next to each

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
other and created this
perfect grass circle,

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
even single blades still
standing, you know,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
tall blades.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we tracked
them to where

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
they were on the north side
of that little green garden

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.235 align:middle line:84%
area, which is
that little square

00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:26.374 align:middle line:90%
to the south of the circle.

00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And the guy had
walked up-- he was

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
on the south side
of that garden area.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And he sat there, and just
had this thing blaring,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.729 align:middle line:84%
these things blaring
into his face.

00:25:34.729 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And he finally lifted up his
flashlight, clicked it on,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.801 align:middle line:90%
it went dead.

00:25:37.801 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They took off.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so-- no, they
just hid, they ducked down.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he got really
scared, and he went back.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, we traced back.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
found that they had also

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
crossed that road again
on the other side, where

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that little square is,
into that field, which

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
is where that red tracing.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.177 align:middle line:84%
And in that high
grass, they just-- they

00:25:55.177 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
literally just straddled
that 5-foot fence like it

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:90%
was nothing.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
their footprints

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%
going back up into the woods.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There must more
evidence out there, Rhettman,

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.335 align:middle line:84%
more witnesses than
we can imagine.

00:26:06.335 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: There are.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And most people are afraid
of the stigma involved,

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:90%
so they'll not say anything.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.924 align:middle line:84%
Or if they do get
into this, they'll

00:26:13.924 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
put themselves under
a pseudonym so they

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:90%
don't know who they are.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
That screamer was the
same type of scream

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that was-- I lived
in Coupeville in '98,

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and in a place called
Admiral's Cove.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And we had come back
on a Thursday night

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
from Christmas shopping.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.927 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- a box had fallen
out of-- my dad was living

00:26:31.927 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
with us at this
time-- out of his van.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I was picking this stuff
up, and my wife came out.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And before she came
up to me, I started

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.255 align:middle line:84%
realizing all the dogs in the
neighborhood were howling.

00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:42.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, dogs are pretty
brave animals.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: But this
is was a weird howl.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:10%
It was like, help me.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Get me away.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.816 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They didn't want
anything to do with them.

00:26:50.816 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Do these creatures eat dogs?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: They've been known
to kill them, yes, very much so.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was
listening to the dogs,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized
I'm hearing the scream

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
call over the top
of these things.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And my wife comes out,
she-- by this time,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
we'd already been
married a few months.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
She'd already heard
all my recordings.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.635 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
nice, that's pleasant.

00:27:09.635 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
she starts talking.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.126 align:middle line:90%
I said shh, listen.

00:27:13.126 --> 00:27:14.305 align:middle line:90%
And then she heard it.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes went as
wide as saucers.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.577 align:middle line:10%
But I stepped out into
the road, and I walked up

00:27:18.577 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:10%
the end of Mitchell Drive,
which is what lived on,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.142 align:middle line:10%
to Admiral Drive, which
is not a very far walk.

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And again, pitch black.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing this thing
literally 20, 30, 40 feet away,

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:90%
screaming at me.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:10%
And it was just so frustrating,
because it was so dark that you

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:10%
can't see it, but you can
smell it, you can feel it.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.554 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: No fear on your part?

00:27:39.554 --> 00:27:40.595 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: There is fear.

00:27:40.595 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But when you get caught up in
that situation, it goes away.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.415 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a morbid curiosity.

00:27:48.415 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But there have been times when
I've been out in the woods

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
where you have
this sense of fear,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and you need to respect that.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You think
they'd attack you?

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> MULLIS: I'm sure if
the situation was right,

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:10%
they would probably
attack somebody.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:10%
They have attacked
people in the past.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: For no reason?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: No, it's
always a reason.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Whether they feel--
it's just like coming up

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:90%
across a bear in the woods.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They might
feel threatened.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.723 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Yeah,
they feel threatened.

00:28:12.723 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll do a typical charge
stance, intimidation stance,

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:90%
just like a gorilla would do.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And they have killed people,
so you just have to be careful.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.184 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
for all the stories

00:28:27.184 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that we have of them killing
somebody or threatening

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
somebody, we have even
thousands more stories of them

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
not, of them actually
doing kindness.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have they ever
tried helping people?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: Yes.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories,
actually, comes out of Montana.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.705 align:middle line:84%
A guy had-- he was a recluse,
had been living there out

00:28:45.705 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
nowhere for a long time.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
He had an ongoing
history of feeding them,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:90%
especially in the winter time.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And he had a relationship with
what he called the Old Gray.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.499 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he fell on a
trail and broke his leg.

00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And he thought, OK, this is it.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is it.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm stuck here.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: Because the nearest
neighbor is 5, 10 miles away.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah,
they'll never find you.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: The Old Gray
came up, picked him up,

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and carried him all the
way to the next neighbor.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.583 align:middle line:90%
>> MULLIS: OK.

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's not an
uncommon story, either.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:10%
So it's all about
relationships here,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:10%
which is what I do for
a living, relationships.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:10%
You were talking about
communication earlier as well.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:10%
Because they're so
human-like, there

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:10%
have-- humans don't
communicate primarily by words.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.326 align:middle line:10%
We don't.

00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:10%
We communicate by
the nonverbal first.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.634 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Actions,
gestures, things.

00:29:35.634 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MULLIS: And just like
our dog, we can read a dog,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:90%
just like our dog can read us.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoots can do the same thing.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.556 align:middle line:84%
So they can read
intent even by watching

00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
you walk through the words.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you an aggressive person,
or are you nonaggressive?

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I would wave at one.
