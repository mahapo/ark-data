>>GEORGE NOORY: Hi.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:10%
What you're about to hear
today is a dramatic program

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with
the Federal Reserve.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So many people believe
the Federal Reserve

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:90%
is part of the US government.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.917 align:middle line:84%
As you will hear from G.
Edward Griffin, it is not.

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: He has challenged
the status quo and pushed

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
boundaries for decades.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
G. Edward Griffin is
best known as the author

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:10%
of the groundbreaking
book, The Creature

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:10%
from Jekyll Island, which
exposes the Federal Reserve.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1960s, Griffin
has confronted conspiracies

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
over American foreign policy,
the international monetary

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:90%
system, and the United Nations.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
He is no stranger to
controversial opinions ranging

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:10%
from the political to the
scientific, your health,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.177 align:middle line:10%
and more.

00:01:09.177 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in
this special edition

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of "Beyond Belief"
with G. Edward Griffin,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk
primarily about the Federal

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Reserve and government
and what they're

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:90%
doing to affect all of us.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Edward, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>G. EDWARD GRIFFIN: Thank you.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's good to meet you
in person after so many "Coast

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to Coast" appearances.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It is, indeed.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I get to see the face
attached to the man.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I do, too.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And I do, too.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
When we talked years
ago about The Creature

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
from Jekyll Island, I got more
response on the radio show

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.397 align:middle line:84%
than any interview I've
done and it is amazing.

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
get into that, but I

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
want you to explain what
the Federal Reserve is

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
because there are still
a lot of people out there

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
who think that the Federal
Reserve is part of the US

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: That's right.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, before I
answer that question,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to comment on
the response that you had.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:10%
It's truly amazing
to me because when

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:10%
I wrote this book
I thought, nobody's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:10%
going to want to read
about the Federal Reserve.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought, I wasted
seen years my life

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:10%
and I ordered all these books.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I said to my wife, oh my
gosh, what have I done?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that
the popular response

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:90%
has been so strong.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And in looking back on
it now in retrospect,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I do understand it
more clearly than when

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I started the project.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the banking system
and the monetary system

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
touches every
aspect of our lives,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and especially lately
with the economy getting

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
under great stress
and people worried

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
about what happens next, there
is a lot of interest in that.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But now to the question,
what is this thing,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.227 align:middle line:90%
this thing I call the creature?

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're right, it's not
a government agency at all,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
although I thought it was
when I started down this path.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And they go to great lengths
to make it appear that it is.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it has the power
of government behind it,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
which is what makes it seem
like a government agency.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the chairman is
appointed by president, right?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.193 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yes, he is but
that's an interesting question

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
in itself because in
most cases-- in fact,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I think in all cases--
the president has never

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.897 align:middle line:84%
met the chairman
when he appoints him.

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know who this guy is.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's just told--

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.525 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: He's just told.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.865 align:middle line:84%
And that leads down
another path, who tells him

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:16.615 align:middle line:84%
and who has the
authority to suggested

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that here's the list of three or
four people you might consider?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's another issue.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a cartel,
that's the bottom line.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.402 align:middle line:84%
It's no different than a banana
cartel or an oil cartel--

00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:29.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a drug cartel.

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: A drug
cartel, exactly.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be
a banking cartel.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that word means
a little explanation.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
A cartel merely is
a shared monopoly.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It represents a
group of companies

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:90%
who appear to be competitors.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They're in the same
field but they're

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
tired of competing
with each other

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
because to be successful
in competition,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you have to offer a better
product or service or a lower

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
price or something and
they don't like that.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So they decide after a while
to get together and share

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
the market and stop competing
so they can guarantee

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:84%
their control over the
market and more profits

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And that all started at the
turn of the last century,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
when America gradually and--
maybe not so gradually, rather

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
quickly, now that I
think about it-- moved

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
from the tradition of free
enterprise competition, which

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is how America became
great in my view

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
because companies
did have to compete.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
After the biggest
companies-- JP Morgan

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Rockefellers-- they
got to the top of the mountain,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
they decided they didn't
want any competitors coming

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:90%
after them.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted
to own the mountain.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.649 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They wanted
to own the mountain

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:90%
and take the latter away.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So they started to join
together and form cartels.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And that means that they
agree with each other

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to divide their markets
and their patents

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and their processes that
we won't compete here.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll all charge the same
price or you get North America,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I get South America, you
get to produce automobiles,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I produce tractors,
and this sort of thing.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And the end of that process is
that the people are paying more

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.502 align:middle line:84%
for the product or services
and they don't have the choice.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And the corporations are
very happy, thank you,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
because they now own the
mountain, as you say.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prior to the Federal
Reserve's creation, though,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.642 align:middle line:84%
what did we have for a monetary
system in this country?

00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: A very good
question because people think,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.516 align:middle line:84%
and if you read the textbooks it
says pretty clearly that we had

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:22.271 align:middle line:90%
chaos in the monetary system.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
needed the Federal

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Reserve is to organize
it and get rid

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
of that chaotic environment.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the matter is we
had a lot of little Federal

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Reserves in America.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Every state had its own
version of what we now

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.529 align:middle line:90%
call the Federal Reserve.

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Independent little
banks and things like that?

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.278 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
independent, yeah.

00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The bank of a state would they
go to the state legislature

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and they would negotiate
with the politicians

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to get certain
privileges and the right

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to do things that other
companies couldn't do.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
They make promises they don't
have to keep, for example.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.545 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
well, since banking

00:05:57.545 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
is so important to the
economy and to the nation

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
or to the state,
in this case, we

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
want to know that
you will protect us

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and if we got into trouble,
you will bail us out--

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
they didn't use that
phrase in those days,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
but that's what it was--
you'll make us whole

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
again because if you don't it
will be bad for the country

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:90%
or for the state.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But that was going on
in all of the states.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the reason
there were bank runs,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
banks were failing and
people were saying,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
we want our money
back that we deposited

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
into your venerable
bank and now you tell us

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%
you don't have the money.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:90%
But we want it now.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
terrible exposure

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
of the fraud that was
made legal, by the way,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
state by state.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And so banking had
a bad reputation.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.859 align:middle line:84%
And instead of solving
the problem, what

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:84%
they did is they all
got together and said,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
let's all share this problem,
let's make it bigger,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.797 align:middle line:84%
let's make it national
rather than on a state level.

00:06:48.797 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't change anything
except to make it bigger

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and kick the can down a little
bit and the can got bigger.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So we inherited all
of those problems

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
when the Federal Reserve
System was created.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who helped create it,
what president at the time?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, Woodrow
Wilson was president

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
at the time when the
bill was passed, in 1913.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
story in itself

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
because Wilson was actually
the candidate of the bankers.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
He was selected by a small
group of very elite banking

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
interests.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Edward Mandell
House was his name,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
lived in the White House, by
the way, when Wilson was--

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He lived
in the White House?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.179 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: He lived, had an
office in the White House,

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:10%
had two rooms in
the White House.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:10%
He was the hidden
influence behind Wilson.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And Wilson admitted
that, he wrote about it.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, Wilson
teaches me everything,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
what Wilson says I believe.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And Wilson was really
the unknown president

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And the story there
is that Wilson

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
campaigned to a heavy
degree against the banks.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, we have a problem
with the banks, the elites

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.024 align:middle line:84%
and Wall Street and
we have to break

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:90%
the grip of the money trust.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.564 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
theme of the day

00:08:05.564 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and Wilson was in
the middle of that.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.996 align:middle line:84%
People didn't know
that he was their man.

00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tactic,
by the way, we

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
see all the time in politics.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
You lead your own
opposition and then

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
betray the people
that believe in you.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was the game was played
and Wilson was the quarterback.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they formed
this organization called

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve, which
then by calling it federal,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
everybody thought it was part
of the United States government,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.699 align:middle line:90%
dictating monetary policy.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But the policy came from these
independent and private banks

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
that were part of
the Federal Reserve.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
that is it exactly.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Because in 1910
and thereabouts, it

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
was clear that the
political pressure

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
was moving in the direction
of some kind of legislation

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:90%
to control the banks.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And so these guys
are not stupid,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:84%
they're are some of the most
brilliant men in the world.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
this is going to happen,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have legislation
to control the banks.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Why should we sit here
and let somebody else

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:90%
write this legislation for us?

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We'll do it, we'll write
our own legislation.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.482 align:middle line:84%
Which is why they had
to do it in secret.

00:09:16.482 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up a
very intriguing part

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:90%
of this whole story.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The reason I called my book
The Creature from Jekyll Island

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is because this whole thing
was done on a private island

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
called Jekyll Island,
off the coast of Georgia.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They went there so that
they wouldn't be seen,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.669 align:middle line:84%
there wouldn't be
newspaper reporters.

00:09:34.669 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
the Bohemian Grove

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.344 align:middle line:84%
people and all of the
Bilderbergs, all those things.

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Get out of the public
view while they did this thing.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.635 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And in those
days, they didn't

00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:10%
have the kind of media
and social networking

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:10%
that we have today.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:10%
It was easy to
hide in those days.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Pretty easy.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.755 align:middle line:90%
Relatively easy, yeah.

00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Especially Jekyll
Island was privately

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:90%
owned by these very people.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Jekyll Island Club

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.924 align:middle line:90%
and it was a resort island.

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it still around?

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Oh, it's
definitely still around.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:90%
You should visit it.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.687 align:middle line:90%
Everybody should visit it.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anybody can visit this?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, anybody can
visit it today, absolutely.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, you
had to take a ferry boat

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to get across the inland
straits and now you

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
can drive across a
bridge and there you are.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of these mansions that
the super wealthy had there--

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
they called them cottages at
the time-- big 14 room, 15 room

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
houses and so forth, they've
been restored, many of them,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can visit and see
how the elite of the period

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:90%
lived in great elegance.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.375 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, they lived well.

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Very well.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.205 align:middle line:10%
They actually had
bathrooms on every floor.

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I take a look at a clip
from the former Fed Chairman

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Ben Bernanke.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
This will astound a lot of you.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN DUNCAN: --caused problems
for the Fed or for the autonomy

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.491 align:middle line:10%
if that legislation was to pass.

00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN BERNANKE: My concern
about the legislation

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:10%
is that if the GAO
is auditing not

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:10%
only the operational
aspects of our programs

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:10%
and the details of the programs,
but is making judgments

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:10%
about our policy decisions,
that would effectively

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.459 align:middle line:10%
be a takeover of monetary policy
by the Congress, a repudiation

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:10%
of the independence of
the Federal Reserve,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:10%
which would be highly
destructive to the stability

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:10%
of the financial
system, the dollar,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.615 align:middle line:10%
and our national
economic situation.

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now let's take a
look at Bernie Sanders talking

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
about the Fed.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BERNIE SANDERS: I understand
that this amendment will not

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
be supported by everyone.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Some may suggest, inaccurately,
that this amendment,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, because I've
heard this statement already,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
takes away the independence
of the Federal Reserve

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and puts monetary policy
into the hands of Congress

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.550 align:middle line:90%
end of quote.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me address those concerns
by simply reading exactly

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
what is in the amendment.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:90%
This is not complicated.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And I quote from page
four of the amendment.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
This is what it says.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you could be
more straightforward than this,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
quote, nothing in
this amendment shall

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
be construed as interference in
or dictation of monetary policy

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
by the Federal Reserve System by
the Congress or the Government

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Accountability
Office end of quote.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.479 align:middle line:84%
You simply can't be more
straightforward than

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:90%
the language in this amendment.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So when people tell you
that this amendment is going

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to interfere and have Congress
dictate monetary policy,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
it is simply not true.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ed, we have two
different juxtaposed positions.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:10%
You've got the former Chairman
of the Federal Reserve, Ben

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:10%
Bernanke, telling you, we
don't need to audit the Fed,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:10%
and then you have Senator
Bernie Sanders saying,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:10%
we've got to get this done.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:10%
Who wins?

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it certainly
isn't the American people.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And I have kind of a jaundiced
view of that because we all

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:84%
understand-- not
all, but many of us

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
understand-- that you
can't trust the banks.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't trust the bankers
because they have a motive.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
They have their own agenda
and it doesn't necessarily

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
include the best interests
of the American people.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But juxtaposed against
that is the idea

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that well, now all we have to
do is turn it over to Congress

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and we can trust those
politicians to do what we

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:90%
can't trust the bankers to do.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my
view, I don't think

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
you can trust the
politicians, either,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:90%
to create money out of nothing.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The concept of who controls
the creation of money,

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Congress or the
banks, is an important concept.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as
important, in my view,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:90%
as the extent of that control.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:10%
If the control were
limited to creating

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:10%
money that was backed by
something of intrinsic value,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:10%
which means that it could
be limited in supply

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.465 align:middle line:10%
and can't just be
created at will--

00:13:57.465 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which
they're doing now.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.256 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Which
they're doing now

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and which all
governments do also.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:10%
If we turned it over
to a government, that

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't change, you see.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question
of who gets the power

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:90%
to create money out of nothing.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is,
well, since we know

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that the banks have
abused that power,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
let's turn it over to these
trustworthy politicians

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.856 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll be safe.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't buy
into that at all.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It could be worse.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It could be worse,
and certainly not any better.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
If the concept of what
that power includes,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
we should not allow anyone to
create money out of nothing.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It should be backed
by something that

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
takes human effort to
produce, has intrinsic value.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And that all by itself would
solve, in my view, about 95%

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
of all of our monetary issues.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't want
to lose that kind of power, Ed.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Oh, no.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
They fight over
who has that power.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean can you imagine
creating money out of nothing?

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
This would be like you,
you're at home saying,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I need $10,000 today.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have it, so you
make it and now you have it.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what's
been going on all these years.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I've always
wondered, though, why

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
we can do it in
the United States

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.485 align:middle line:84%
to create this
incredible wealth out

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
of nothing and some
other third world

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
countries that have
nothing, have no money,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
they can't do it.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Is it because people
look at the dollar

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
as the power dollar
in the world?

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that's
exactly it, George.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The comparison between
the money in Zimbabwe,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the United
States Federal Reserve notes

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
revealed that
neither one of them

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.527 align:middle line:84%
are worth anything
intrinsically.

00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zero value.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Zero real
intrinsic value,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:10%
except maybe you could
light a fire with them,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:10%
the value of burning paper.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
You might, if you were
freezing, have a little bonfire.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you needed to shim a
table up so it didn't it tilt,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
you could get a
stack of $100 bills

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and have some intrinsic value.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:90%
But beyond that, that's it.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So why do they accept
American dollars

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
around the world and not
the Zimbabwe dollars?

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And the answer,
as you suggested,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
is the strength of the dollar.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
How you define strength,
why is it strong?

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It's primarily because
it's already in place,

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
it's been in place since
the end of World War II.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
The Bretton Woods agreement
set the American dollar

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
international trade.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.122 align:middle line:84%
It's also strong
because of US military.

00:16:26.122 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
There have been
countries that have

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.177 align:middle line:84%
tried to break away from
using the American dollar--

00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Iraq being one of them.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Iraq
being one of them.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And whenever some
country decides

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
it wants to use something
other than American dollars

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
in international trade, in
particular in the purchase

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and selling of oil,
well, all of a sudden

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
those countries are declared to
be rogue countries and centers

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of terrorism and we
send in the Marines

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and we have a regime change.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.574 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
how that works.

00:16:54.574 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Very interesting.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then with
that regime change,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.452 align:middle line:84%
the new leader wants
to keep the dollar.

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Wants
to keep the dollar

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're back in
operation again.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how
Qaddafi and people like

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that-- when they wanted to
get off the dollar for the oil

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
standard, that's where
they made their mistake.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Then all of a
sudden, they're the bad guys.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I don't think
there are many real good guys

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
out there, but we're
highly selective on which

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%
ones are the worst.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, as
far as the American

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
public is concerned, Ed, do they
have any say so in any of this,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:90%
or are we at their mercy?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Hard question.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Right now I think the
mechanism is still there

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
for the American people
do have a say so.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not being used
because Americans are so

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
influenced by the educational
system, influenced

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
by the media, influenced by
politics that they don't really

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
perceive, I believe,
don't perceive

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
the world in the reality
that they should.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And so they're easily swayed.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They still have the power, but
they're not using the power.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We've surrendered a lot of
power to the political parties

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
without realizing the
political parties, both

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
of the major ones, are
really under the influence

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of these same
international forces

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and they give us the illusion
of going back and forth--

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
oh, the Republicans are going
to win this year, the Democrats,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
no, they're going to take over--
and we get this the feeling

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that we're having a contest
between two opposing groups.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
the control mechanisms,

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.985 align:middle line:84%
both of these groups are
really in the same sphere

00:18:34.985 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and controlled by a relatively
small group of people

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that have the same domestic
and international policies.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So right now it's
kind of a farce,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
but we still have
the mechanism there,

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
if we have the
knowledge and the will,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to break the grip
of this control.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I think we could return
to where we should be.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope so, too.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:84%
The Fed has kept interest rates
at virtually zero for years,

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:90%
inching it up just slightly.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It will probably inch up for the
rest of the year just slightly.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Now they're talking about
negative interest rates, which

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
means that if you put
$10,000 in a bank, in a year

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:84%
you can go and get your
money and it might be $9,916.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It'll be less than what it
was when you brought it in.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.147 align:middle line:90%
How can they do this?

00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, they've
been doing that for years

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:84%
through inflation, except we
look at the numbers and not

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
the purchasing power.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
If we had a
purchasing power index

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that we were using instead
of the numbers, dollars,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
we would see that they're
already decreasing our savings

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:90%
account every year.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So they can do it because
the American people don't

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
understand it and they
don't have any options.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they actually start
showing the numbers going down

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
in terms of hard numbers,
rather than in purchasing power,

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
it presents a real challenge
because people will take

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
their money out of the banks.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.436 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well,
we're not going

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to play that game anymore.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So now we hear a lot of talk
about getting rid of currency

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so that people can literally
not take their money out

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:90%
of the bank.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost impossible
to get your money out

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:90%
of the bank today.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Ed, if you go to the bank
and you make a deposit,

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be a
certain amount, right?

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's over that, you
have to report that-- I'm

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:90%
talking about a cash deposit.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
want to take it out,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:90%
it's like robbing Fort Knox.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
they come up to you

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
say, well, we can't do that.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about a lot of cash.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you want $3,000,
$4,000 out of the bank account.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They say, you can't
take that money,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:90%
we don't have it here right now.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of this before.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it's
increasingly happening

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to see more of it.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think the ultimate
solution to that dilemma

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.289 align:middle line:84%
is that they'll
simply eliminate cash.

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
sell that right now

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
as being a good thing.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We should want that because cash
is used by criminals and drug

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
lords and that sort of
thing and it's inconvenient

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and you can get robbed
and all these things

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
they're using to sell us on
the idea of getting rid of cash

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and going strictly to a
denominated type of currency

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that's all checkbook money.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And that way, we have
no ability to withdraw.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
We cannot withdraw, except to
buy something and then we can

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
buy a crate of
oranges or something.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got money
outside of the system,

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
but oranges will
rot and so forth.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
Bitcoins, isn't it?

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that what they
want to do with us?

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.794 align:middle line:90%
Bitcoins, everything's digital?

00:21:36.794 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah, I
think they would like

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:90%
to have everything digital.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Because that way we can't
escape the system, you see.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
As long as money
is real, if it's

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
backed by gold or silver or
marshmallows or something

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that you can use,
people have some way

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
to escape that kind
of absolute control.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But if money is
completely digital

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and you can't take
it in any other form,

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
they have you completely
under their control.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the oil cartels,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
the drug cartels that are
making hundreds and hundreds

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
of millions of
dollars illicitly?

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
If there's no cash,
how is a drug cartel

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.024 align:middle line:84%
going to transfer electronic
money into a system?

00:22:21.024 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
it's very simple.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do that.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.986 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: In my view,
it's very simple.

00:22:24.986 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be a
controversial statement,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
but all they have do
is just buy Congress.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's a lot
of money in the drug cartel

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
business and they have a
lot of political influence

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and they have exceptions.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
They will be able to find
exceptions to these rules.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Honest, law abiding
people will not.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you're sitting on
the cash flow involving

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of millions of dollars,
you can buy politicians.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the system is
politicized like it is now,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that means you can buy
an exception to the rule

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:90%
that other people have to obey.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
will the Federal Reserve

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
ever go away?

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Hard question.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to say it's
not will it, it must.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If men are to continue
to live in freedom

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and any kind of dignity,
they must throw off

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
this kind of control that's
being built around them.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.355 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, it will hardly
be a humanized society.

00:23:35.355 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It will be a beehive society
and will be totally controlled

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:90%
through the monetary system.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We're getting in
that direction now,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%
we're moving in that direction.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So my answer is a
reluctant one because I

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
fear that we're heading
in the opposite direction.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But I say we must
make that happen.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:90%
We must.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We must dedicate
ourselves to that.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what it takes,
we must bring that about.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.937 align:middle line:84%
We must break the grip
of that money trust.

00:23:59.937 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you wrote The
Creature from Jekyll Island,

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:84%
did you expect that kind of
response, the response being,

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, there's a
Federal Reserve out there

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing this to us?

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: No.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't really.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was
kind of a surprise

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to me that I had any kind
of positive results at all.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those cases, I
think many people experience it.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:90%
You learn as you go.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You become a teacher
because you've

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
learned a few things and
people ask you to explain it

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and in the process
of explaining it,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
you discover, oh, there's
something I don't know.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And you go back and
you learn that and now

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.044 align:middle line:84%
you have a little
more knowledge.

00:24:36.044 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue to
teach, you continue to learn.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's been the
story of my life.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought I understood
something early on,

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized
10 years later

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:90%
I was just a babe in the woods.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You still
had to learn more.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.029 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yes,
learn more and more.

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We used to be on
the gold standard, gold

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:90%
backing our money.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that anymore.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So realistically, how weak
is our monetary system?

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.705 align:middle line:90%
It could collapse at any time.

00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, yes.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And it probably will, as long
as it is based on the concept

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:90%
that it now is based.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
A monetary system is
useful only to the extent

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that people will use it
and willingly use it.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You can force people to use
a monetary system, of course,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.781 align:middle line:84%
and then you're not
talking about a system

00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:90%
that we want to live in.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.870 align:middle line:10%
You're trapped, you might
as well be in prison.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of a prison without
walls, with economic walls

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:10%
instead.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we have to
break that system.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we have to return

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of a standard
of measure of value,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we're going to be
just put into an economic prison

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
and we will have no escape.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We seem to be
like sheep, though, Ed.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We just seem to follow along
just doing whatever government

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
dictates to us because we really
don't have much of a choice.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the bottom line, we
don't have much of a choice?

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%
People need money.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that
is the test, isn't it?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Choice, we must have choice.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And we do have choices still,
but they get harder and harder.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that we
could make easy choices,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
but the growth of a
tyrannical government all

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
around the world, not just here,
but everywhere in the world,

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is all about limiting
those choices so that we

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:90%
have fewer and fewer options.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's been
going on, certainly

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:90%
going on in my entire life.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised to find out how
far it was already progressed

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:90%
when I tuned into it.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I was born into
the system thinking,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.139 align:middle line:84%
this is America and I love
America and I still do.

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I still think it's the
best country in the world,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:84%
but now I realize what's
been happening to it.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.306 align:middle line:84%
They've been whittling away at
it, chopping pieces out of it.

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And they'd been doing that long
before I came on the scene,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
long before I was born
even, and I didn't know it.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think, unfortunately,
many people today still

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
don't know that this
process is going on.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So although we remain
loyal and happy citizens

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.634 align:middle line:84%
and grateful citizens,
we have to, I believe,

00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:84%
take on the responsibility
of saying, wait a minute,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
this is my country,
this is my system,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing bad things
to it and I have to defend it.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I must stop it, I
must reverse it.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an obligation
of patriotism,

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
I think, that we have.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big to fail is it?

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
We saw back in 2007-2008
that they would not

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
like big banks fail,
they're too big to fail.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:90%
What could happen now?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:84%
What about the next
economic downturn?

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I'm very bad
at making predictions

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:84%
because usually I'm off in
timing, not by substance.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not in concept.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Not in
concept, by timing.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.804 align:middle line:84%
I always think the
bad things are going

00:27:54.804 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:90%
to happen sooner than they do.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They still happen, but
I miss them by date.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the question
is, where are we headed?

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.715 align:middle line:84%
Is that the essence
of the question?

00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It depends on
us, that's the bottom line.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:84%
If we do nothing, if we
make no changes at all,

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
we're just headed into
something new in history,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:90%
I think, something new.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this
point, we've always

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:90%
had the ability to rebound.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We can go through bad
experiences, we can have wars,

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
we can have world
wars, and yet cities

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
rebuild; families, they
recover; corporations

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:90%
recover, they rebuild.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:10%
I think we're going
into something

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.450 align:middle line:10%
now that's a little
bit different,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and that is that for the first
time in history on this planet,

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:10%
all of civilization is being
brought into a global one

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:10%
unified-- the plan.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:10%
There's no place to go.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:10%
There are no escape
hatches, there are no doors

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:10%
that you can go
out the back way,

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:10%
there's no field that
you could rebuild on

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:10%
because it's all now one.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
If they can succeed in capturing
the whole world this time,

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%
there will be no place to go.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they succeed in
eliminating money, for example,

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
except through digits
that the governments give

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to you in reward for your
being good boys and girls,

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
essentially, complying
and don't resist.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.174 align:middle line:84%
You get reward points and
you live well like that.

00:29:28.174 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
what I'm saying is

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
if you envision the
world becoming much

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.831 align:middle line:84%
like a military organization,
where there is rank,

00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and you don't really have to
buy anything because everything

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:90%
is provided by the system.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You go into the mess hall
in the food was there.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to buy it
because you're in the military.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.532 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to buy clothes
because they're issued to you.

00:29:48.532 --> 00:29:50.615 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to buy
transportation because there

00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:10%
are trucks and everything.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So you don't really
need money anymore

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:90%
under a military system.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
perhaps a good analogy

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
for the type of system
we're moving into,

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
where money will no longer
even be in existence.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It will just be
credits of some kind,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:84%
bonus points depending
on the extent

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:90%
to which you serve the system.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you step outside of that,
they'll just cut off your bonus

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
points and you won't be
able to eat or live--

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.275 align:middle line:84%
I think we're headed
for that kind of a thing

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.427 align:middle line:90%
and that's new in history.

00:30:20.427 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's scary.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It's scary.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop it
because once we get there,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to imagine how
mankind could get out of it.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever get to
a point, Ed, where we wake up,

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:84%
check our bank accounts,
and the money's gone?

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it's
already happened.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not all of the
money is gone, but look

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.804 align:middle line:90%
what happened in Cyprus and--

00:30:45.804 --> 00:30:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.636 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It's scary.

00:30:47.636 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And some of the money was gone,
big chunks of it just gone.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And it points to the fact
that today's view of banking

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
is a little different
than it was 100 years ago.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, you put
your money in the bank

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and the bank said, well, thank
you, we'll guard your money

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and if you want it back,
we'll give it back to you

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
because that's our contract.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Now you put the
money in the bank

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and they say, thank you
for investing it with us.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It's now our money and let's
hope we can do well with it.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But if we can't,
well, we both lose.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the FDIC
truly be able to ensure up

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:84%
to $250,000 per account
if we had a disaster?

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, they can if
they take it from us first

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.800 align:middle line:90%
and then give it back to us.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.644 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's how they'll do it.

00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:90%
That's how they do it.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So they create the
money out of nothing

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and then say, here,
you can have it.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It didn't exist 10 minutes
ago, but now you have it.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Which means that the
inflation would be so rampant

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.735 align:middle line:90%
that it's worthless.

00:31:45.735 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed, we've got some
Facebook questions here

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go through them.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Kevin mentions, what do you
know about Chinese bonds

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese investments
with the Federal Reserve?

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.495 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything there?

00:31:59.495 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, the active
word there is "know," do I know?

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I really don't have first
hand information on that.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It's my impression-- as long
as that word is understood--

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:84%
my impression that Chinese
have over the years

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:84%
acquired tremendous amount of
government equities, bonds.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But they stopped buying
them some time ago

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and gradually are
liquidating them.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.160 align:middle line:84%
They want to get out of
bonds as quickly as possible,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but since they have
so many of them

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you can't just do
this all at once

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
without disrupting the
international economy.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And also the Chinese are
dependent on the value

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.200 align:middle line:84%
of those bonds because
they hold so many of them.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So they can't do anything
that would suddenly

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.254 align:middle line:84%
downgrade the value
of those bonds

00:32:51.254 --> 00:32:52.795 align:middle line:84%
because they'd be
hurting themselves.

00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They'd crush themselves

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.158 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: They'd
crush themselves.

00:32:55.158 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
the primary reason

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:84%
they're in a very slow process
of getting rid of those bonds.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
those bonds, they

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:90%
want to be independent of them.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think what they're
doing is gradually

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to transfer
their assets from bonds

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.992 align:middle line:90%
into precious metals.

00:33:11.992 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:84%

Carrie writes, what would
happen to the economy

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.516 align:middle line:90%
if we simply abolished the Fed?

00:33:19.516 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
can't do that anymore.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I think we've gone too far.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I think The Creature from Jekyll
Island has gotten too big.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I
think it has to happen.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But the question
is, how rapidly?

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Can it be done cold turkey?

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I agree that cold
turkey-- let's face it,

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:84%
we're sort of like
a drug addict.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Were addicted to the
Federal Reserve System,

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
we're addicted to
this free money

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that is created easily and
pumped into the system.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
Federal Reserve notes.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if we just get rid of
all of that, all of a sudden

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
we're back practically to
living in caves eating raw meat.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:90%
What do we do for money?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear that we can't
just get rid of it quickly.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
it could be phased out

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.701 align:middle line:90%
over a period of time.

00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:08.409 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what that
time would be but,

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
in my view it probably
would be five, maybe 10

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:90%
years at the most.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
If we gradually introduced
a real currency that

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.760 align:middle line:84%
was backed by something
like gold or silver,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that had value, and then let
people choose between the two,

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd see a process
whereby people would start

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:84%
cashing in their old
Federal Reserve notes,

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
which were backed by paper-- and
that's all they are-- and say,

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I would rather spend 100 of
these old Federal Reserve notes

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that are gradually decreasing
in value every day of my life

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and put them into
a currency that

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
is gold or silver that
is gradually increasing

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:90%
every day of my life.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take a
discount to do it.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
had the freedom

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:84%
to do that and a real currency
in existence to do that it

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
would probably take, in my view,
maybe five years and everybody

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
would have switched over and we
would have made the transition

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
not entirely without a
little disease and pain,

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
but we would make it
without collapsing.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a program
called Better Call Saul

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
out there, Edward, and it's
about a shyster attorney trying

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to make a living,
based in New Mexico.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an offshoot from the
Breaking Bad TV series.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And Saul is meeting
with a client

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
who wants to secede
from the United States.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:84%
He owns some acreage and
he wants that acreage

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:90%
to be its own little nation.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he has hired
Saul, the attorney,

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:90%
to sue and to do that.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They started talking
about Saul's fee

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and they came to
an understanding

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that he'd get a
retainer of $1 million.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And the individual who wants to
secede from the United States

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
said, I'll give you
half a million up front.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, Saul is sitting
there going crazy

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
because that's more money
than he's ever had this life.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The guy goes to his safe
and brings back a tray full

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:84%
of $500,000, gives it to Saul,
and Saul is just like in shock.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But he starts
looking at the money

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's printed up with
that guy's face on it.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
They're $100 denomination
notes, but it's

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
got that guy's face on it,
the guy who wants to secede.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:90%
They're worthless.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And Saul looks at it and
goes, well, what's this?

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't take this money.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, in due time
it'll be worth something.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.707 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel that way
about our money right now.

00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, which way, that
it's going down or coming up?

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That it's going down.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Going down.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the
purchasing power of it.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
any further than that.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When the Federal Reserve bills
were introduced back in 1913,

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
they had the
purchasing power if we

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
pay get it $1 for $1,
whatever that was in 1913,

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and look at it today
it's worth $0.03.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:84%
$1 is worth $0.03
in purchasing power.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's since 1913.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
That's almost
within the lifetime

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of-- probably a few
people alive this still

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
saw the whole thing happen.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's generational and
it's going on all the time.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the plan,
it's not an accident.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.457 align:middle line:90%
The people that--

00:37:23.457 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, like you said,
they're not stupid people.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.331 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They're
not stupid people.

00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And they know that as long
as they can be whittled away

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
at purchasing power 3%
to 5% or 6% per year,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
people will grumble but
they'll put up with it.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And they get old and they die.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Their kids don't
know any different,

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what $1 used to buy.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.395 align:middle line:90%
And so they put up with it.

00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's this gradual transition,
one generation to the other.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way of
milking society

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of their purchasing power
by the economic scientists.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the Federal
Reserve interact, if they do,

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.555 align:middle line:90%
with world banks?

00:38:00.555 --> 00:38:03.144 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.144 --> 00:38:05.185 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: How do they
interact with world banks?

00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, world banks and
the Federal Reserve

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:90%
are sort of joined at the hip.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:90%
They're like Siamese twins.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The World Bank is--
you might consider it

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.085 align:middle line:84%
as the central
bank of the world.

00:38:21.085 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
Board is the central bank

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.835 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:25.049 align:middle line:90%
They're both central banks.

00:38:25.049 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
interact with each other?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.548 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They interact
with each other.

00:38:28.548 --> 00:38:30.654 align:middle line:84%
They share assets, they
support each other.

00:38:30.654 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:84%
People go to work
from one to the other,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.690 align:middle line:90%
they move from one to the other.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The philosophy is the same,
except that the objective,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:84%
of course, is
international with the IMF,

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas with the Federal
Reserve System it's national,

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.500 align:middle line:90%
theoretically.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have heard,
this is what I heard,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that they like to loan
money to Third World nations

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and force them to default
so they can take over

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:84%
their assets, be it the
land or the country itself.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear of that?

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Oh, yes.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They don't want
the loans paid back.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that's true.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want
a loan paid back when

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
they could get the country?

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what they really want.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the goal?

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to own the country

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of real
estate, but they

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:90%
want to own it politically.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They
want the people--

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want the control.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.021 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: --the control of it.

00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And that has been going
on ever since-- well,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
ever since the United
Nations was formed.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You look at these countries, the
ones that are getting trashed

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
are resisting that.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you put this
back on the gold standard?

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Absolutely.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.406 align:middle line:90%
Or some standard at least.

00:39:41.406 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
standard it is.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Whatever people want, they
ought to have whatever standard

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people want some
kind of a standard,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:84%
they don't want some
politician's word.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.479 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To date, we have
nothing backing up our money.

00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Except our military.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: That's it.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.448 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lot, by the way.

00:39:58.448 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may
be more than gold.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.998 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: In fact, that's
how they look at it.

00:40:01.998 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
As long as we have
the supreme military,

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
we can demand anything we want
in any country and if they

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.730 align:middle line:84%
don't comply-- if they
don't accept our dollars,

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
international trade, well,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.435 align:middle line:84%
all we have to do is declare
them as a rogue nation--

00:40:16.435 --> 00:40:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And take them out.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.515 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: --and send
the Marines in and say,

00:40:19.515 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
look at the good
job we're doing.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:90%
We're fighting terrorism.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
countries like Russia,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.820 align:middle line:84%
who would love their
rubles to replace

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.065 align:middle line:90%
the dollar, what do they do?

00:40:30.065 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, they're trying
to do the same thing, actually.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:90%
They want the game.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.030 align:middle line:84%
They want to play the
game, except they want

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:90%
their game instead of our game.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't blame them.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, no.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't blame them if
that's your mentality

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to rule and to steal from
your fellow human beings

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and do it politically
and do it legally.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can't
blame them unless you

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
look at it ethically,
which I think

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:90%
is the way we should look at.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible crime
to commit against

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.487 align:middle line:90%
your fellow human beings.

00:40:57.487 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:90%
But they don't care.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.544 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: They don't care.

00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the big
difference with all of this.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The average person who
collects a paycheck,

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
who owns a car, who's trying
to make their mortgage,

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.190 align:middle line:90%
does this affect him at all?

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It affects
him from the moment

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:84%
he awakes to the moment
he goes back to sleep

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:90%
because it affects two things.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It affects the purchasing
power of his hourly wage.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Inflation is the
word we put to that.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.700 align:middle line:84%
He works like a dog or
she works like a cat,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:84%
however you want to keep
the genders straight here,

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to make a living and
they put money aside

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
for their old age or to
send their kids to school.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, these hidden
forces are whittling away

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
at those dollars or whatever
monetary unit it is,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're stealing
it literally.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a terrible,
terrible system.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.369 align:middle line:84%
And how can I say--
I don't know where

00:41:54.369 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I was going with
that, except that we

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:90%
have to break that system.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
I would support.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not sustainable.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:07.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If we're around
50 years from now, Ed,

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.830 align:middle line:10%
how old will I be?

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I'll be here.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.514 align:middle line:90%
You might be.

00:42:11.514 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Another 50.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be in shock
if the Federal Reserve were

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:90%
still around 50 years from now?

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I wouldn't expect
the Federal Reserve to exist

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.403 align:middle line:90%
as such 50 years from now.

00:42:24.403 --> 00:42:25.653 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will be different.

00:42:25.653 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.766 align:middle line:84%
Depending on which
scenario we take.

00:42:28.766 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
If we say that everything
continues without change,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I think the Federal
Reserve will be

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.190 align:middle line:84%
absorbed in some kind of an
international equivalent.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.080 align:middle line:84%
As we move toward this
one world government.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.690 align:middle line:90%
That's where they want it to go.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's one scenario.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cashless?

00:42:46.527 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It would be cashless.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's part of it.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really escape any
record of your transaction.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if the grid goes down,

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the power grid
goes and and we're

00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:84%
tied into all these electronic
figures and digits and people

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
don't have access
to anything anymore?

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:84%
If the computer systems go down,
so does your monetary system

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.485 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: If the
grid goes down,

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.730 align:middle line:84%
George, this is the
worst case scenario

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine unless the Earth
collides with another planet.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're in a similar
vein because it's

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:84%
the end of everything
we know as life.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:84%
When the grid goes down, we
discover then that everything

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:84%
we do and have depends on
power, electricity, water

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the pipe.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
electricity, really.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.065 align:middle line:84%
That's our primary
source of energy.

00:43:41.065 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's going to be
an interesting future, Ed.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.162 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: We need to
do everything to prepare

00:43:46.162 --> 00:43:47.370 align:middle line:10%
and prevent that, by the way.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:10%
It's one of my favorite topics
but we won't go there today.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.120 align:middle line:10%
But it's a serious danger
and it could happen.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.162 align:middle line:10%
And the powers that be
are ignoring it primarily

00:43:58.162 --> 00:43:59.620 align:middle line:10%
because they don't
want to face it,

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.882 align:middle line:10%
they don't want to be
responsible for it,

00:44:01.882 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and they want to pretend
like it doesn't exist.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.215 align:middle line:90%
But it's very real in my view.

00:44:05.215 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed, thanks for
being on the program.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Thank
you for inviting me.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Federal
Reserve, we all

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.655 align:middle line:84%
have thought-- even
I did-- that it

00:44:13.655 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:90%
was part of the US government.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Is a private cartel owned
by major banks dictating

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:84%
policy to our government,
dictating how we live.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.290 align:middle line:10%
We've got to fight back.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.330 align:middle line:90%
