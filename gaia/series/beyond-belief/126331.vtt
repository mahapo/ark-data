>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and we have an
amazing program for you here.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Dan Hurley our special guest.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He is an award winning
science writer.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:90%
But let's let you see this.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
ANNOUNCER: Psychologists
once held that intelligence

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
was fixed from birth.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But in 2008, a
major study revealed

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that people could
actually improve

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
their fluid intelligence
with training.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Dan Hurley, an
award-winning journalist,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:10%
is the author of Smarter: The
New Science of Building Brain

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:10%
Power.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:10%
In it, he chronicles the
field still in its infancy.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't remain
a casual observer.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.405 align:middle line:84%
The book find some
actively participating

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
in brain building exercises and
reaping the cognitive rewards.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Dan explains how we can all
increase our brain's power

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.927 align:middle line:84%
with a little work,
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dan Hurley,
welcome to the program.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
What a great
introduction for you.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.131 align:middle line:84%
>>DAN HURLEY: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
deal with the brain,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't get into
it as much as you do.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I read your book, you've been
on the radio show before.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:90%
You truly really dive into this.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did that all start?

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're an
award-winning science writer.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just wake
up one day saying,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to concentrate on
writing about brain power.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: Well, I
think most of us

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:10%
assume that IQ and intelligence
is something you're born with.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:10%
That's why they give
you a test and that's

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be your limit.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how smart you are,
you're not going to change.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I did an article five
years ago about Alberto Costa,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
a scientist who in fact used
to be here both in Boulder.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was developing
a medicine that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
could be given to people
with Down syndrome

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to help them increase
their intelligence.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article about that
for the New York Times Magazine

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and then I said, if you can help
disabled people get smarter,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is there any hope
for the rest of us?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that there is a
great deal of research going on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.664 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a
really exciting field.

00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey, Dan, what
creates the difference

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
between someone who is smart
and somebody who is not?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it just the brain, is it
something within that person?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So
intelligence has been

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
studied better than almost
anything by psychologists

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:90%
for over 100 years.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first IQ tests were
developed about 100 years ago

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and scientists are still
struggling to understand

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
what it is about the brain.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one place,
it's the whole brain

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and how it communicates
with each spot.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There's some evidence
that the size

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the size
of certain sections

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
are associated
with intelligence.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, it's things that
are very hard to see visually

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:90%
by an MRI, say.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you bump
your head, if you damage

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
a portion of your brain,
will that affect, then,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
the overall outlook
of your ability to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
have this brain power?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, we know there
are countless things you

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
can do to make yourself dumber.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:90%
You can bump your brain.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can get concussions
and serious repeated head

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
trauma we know are
going to have an effect.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You can spend your days
watching TV-- not this show.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're watching Rocky
and Bullwinkle all day,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:90%
this is not going to help you.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Exposure to trauma,
to abuse, getting

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
addicted to drugs,
alcohol, all these things--

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
not being physically
fit-- all of these things

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.076 align:middle line:84%
are going to have a slow
effect on your brain.

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come in the morning
and sometimes when people wake

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
up, some people can hit the deck
running and they're just ready

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:90%
to go and other people can't?

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
They're groggy, they're slow,
they're not thinking right,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:90%
they don't even talk right.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Why is there that difference?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
That is to do with
there are morning people

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and there are night people,
and scientists know this.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can see this
in tests of people.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
There are people that literally
perform better in the morning.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
your circadian rhythms,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
with your melatonin levels, and
just the way your entire body

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:90%
is cycling.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I have to go
for a run in the morning,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.044 align:middle line:84%
I struggle a lot more than when
I go in the late afternoon.

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
a coffee drinker,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of people
who are coffee drinkers.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
They need that little
caffeine burst to get going.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Does that help the
brain, hurt the brain?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Coffee
absolutely helps.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: There's no question.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm not
a coffee drinker.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.636 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah, well--

00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Another
strange one, people

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
are always asking
about drugs to improve

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:90%
your cognitive abilities.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
There is that movie and
then TV show Limitless.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And actually, all
the drugs that exist

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are just stimulants essentially,
and, really all they're doing

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
is waking you up more.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But the one medicine
that is known to work

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is called nicotine,
maybe you've heard of it.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's in cigarettes.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well,
so cigarettes bad;

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:90%
nicotine without a cigarette.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you're using a nicotine
patch, which I actually

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
use a seven milligram, the
lowest dose, nicotine patch.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an entire
article, there's

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:90%
a lot in my book about it.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You use the patch
just for brain power?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yes.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason
why people want

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to smoke beyond
just being addicted,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
that it actually does
stimulate your brain.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
that it wakes you up,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
it actually makes
you more alert,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
more able to pay
attention to what

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:90%
you want to pay attention to.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
This is why we can all think
of Sigmund Freud with his cigar

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and Winston Churchill.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just to have it.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you cannot
use the tobacco,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
which is not going to help you,
if you can just use nicotine,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
it can actually help.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the nicotine
kick in right away?

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: It does,
pretty quickly.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
see the difference

00:07:35.278 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:90%
when you're not under it?

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So I have used
it for a couple of years

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and I started
noticing immediately

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that on the days that
I thought to put it on,

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
because I was just testing
it after reading about it,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I would get home from
the end of the day

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and notice that I
had been really sharp

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that day, working
really efficiently.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And on days that I just
forgot to put it on,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I was maybe struggling
a little bit more.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's something that can help.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so when you see
people smoke with their coffee,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
they're really getting bursts.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, yeah, except
that cigarettes are not healthy

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's not good for
your brain, either.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So cigarettes would not
be the way to do it.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
about nicotine gum?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: That can also help.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.661 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting thing.

00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I've never known about that.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: That's crazy.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a whole
article about it.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time convincing
my editors because everybody

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:90%
thinks nicotine is bad.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:10%
It's not nicotine so much, it
is the stuff that comes with.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about things like
ginkgo biloba that they say

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to help your brain?

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So there are
people that swear by it.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But when they do studies,
scientific studies,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
placebo controlled,
they don't find much.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
about the ginkgo.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I think there are better ways.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because
you think ginkgo,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
natural, this has got to
be good where nicotine, you

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
think is evil, the
worst thing possible.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So reality doesn't always
follow our preconceptions.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got a little
six-year-old grandson-- got

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of grandsons in St.
Louis-- but the little guy,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Simon, I've noticed when
he plays video games he's

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
sharper than a tack.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean he's there doing
his thing moving, it,

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:90%
and I'm looking at him.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
this when he was four

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying,
how in the heck can

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
a little four-year-old have
that kind of dexterity,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
have that kind of ability
to interact like that?

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:09:52.790 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So the whole
field of video game studies

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
began when some psychologists
were testing themselves

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
on these tests of
mental performance,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:90%
speed of processing it's called.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And the one guy happened to do
really well, better than you're

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be able to do.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the same of his
friends, well, what's going on?

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.804 align:middle line:84%
And he had some of
his friends do it.

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to figure
out, what's going on?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.595 align:middle line:84%
We're doing better than
you're supposed to be

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:90%
able to do on these tests.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was a guy at the
University of Wisconsin.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that the ones that

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
were playing these video
games were doing better.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's now been
shown repeatedly

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.044 align:middle line:84%
that lots of these video games
where you're following things--

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where the
brain is moving fast.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You are outperforming
what people

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.472 align:middle line:84%
thought were the standard
human limits of performance.

00:10:57.472 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
literally training

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
your brain when you do
something like that?

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: There's no
question that you are.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean you are training-- that's
the thing that people have

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to remember, you're training
your brain every day,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%
every minute.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The notion that your
IQ just sits there

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
you're born with-- I

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
mean we know that
if you exercise,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:90%
you get stronger, right?

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you just sit around,
you're going to get weaker.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So the brain responds
in the same way.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the brain responds
perhaps even faster

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:90%
than the body does.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a day to day thing.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why doing
things to stay active

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
makes such a difference.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All things
considered when a baby is born

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and another baby
is born, are they

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
generally the same
brain-wise, assuming

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:90%
there's no medical condition?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
That when they're born,
they are functioning

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
brains that should work
at the same rate and pace?

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, there are
differences, we all know it.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:90%
We all know it from--

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean Einstein had
a different brain than I do,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yes.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I mean in first
grade, every kid knows.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They look around
at their classmates

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and we all have done it,
we've all been there.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of sort out
who's the sharp ones

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and who's the one
that's not getting it,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
who's the one that's for
whatever reason is not

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:90%
doing as well.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are absolutely
individual differences.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The question is, can you
increase your ability,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:90%
can you catch up?

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that there are
those sharp kids in high school

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and in college who
are brilliant students

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and you meet them 10
years later and they're

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
working at a fast
food joint or they're

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
living in the basement--

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they own
the fast food joint.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.688 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, they
might be if they're really

00:13:05.688 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
putting it to work.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
what are you doing

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:90%
with the gifts you were given?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you working them,
are you increasing them,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.314 align:middle line:84%
or are you just
going to squander

00:13:17.314 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
the gifts you've been given?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know in high school,
I knew some people, some guys,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
who were just lousy at
science and biology and math

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and studies like that.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But you put them in
auto mechanics or shop

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and they exceeded way
beyond the rest of us.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Absolutely there's
different competencies.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:90%
We all have different abilities.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
great at dancing.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean you wouldn't have
asked Fred Astaire to do math

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and you probably wouldn't
have asked Einstein

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to dance in the movies.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So we all have
our own strengths.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And there is another thing
that makes people excel,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
which is wisdom and
decision-making.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most exciting
parts of the research that's

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
been going on in this
area of brain training

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is that some of the strongest
effects are on decision-making.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So people that are book smart,
but when they go off and try

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to run a business they just
can't-- they hire the wrong

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
people, they make the wrong
deals, they get suckered,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
they're too fast to anger--
these people need help

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
in decision-making and
wisdom and that is one

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
of the strongest effects that
brain training has been shown

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
to have.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does memory
come into some of this?

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So memory, a lot
of us think about memory

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:90%
as intelligence.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So people think that if
you can memorize a speech--

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and this used to be back
in the day, in the 1920s,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
they would have--
even into the 1950s,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
they would have
kids memorize poems.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
All our grandparents know how
to-- they can review some poem

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
they learned, some
speech they learned.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And educators began realizing
that just spitting back things

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:90%
is not the same as intelligence.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:40.179 align:middle line:84%
Even they've done studies
where people that learn-- we've

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.595 align:middle line:84%
all heard of these
people that you

00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
can read them a
random list of numbers

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and they can
memorize 100 or they

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
can memorize the names of
everyone in the audience.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had a guest
on, his name's Jim Carroll.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You throw out a zip code
and he'll tell you the city.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So it's amazing,
but these kinds of things

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be more
like parlor tricks.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
They're cool, they're
amazing, but they don't seem

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:90%
to have any effect beyond that.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can know every
zip code, but are you

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
any better at reading a
book and understanding

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
it; are you any better at
thinking through a problem

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and at your job
working out a solution?

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you really use
your mind the way

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:90%
people have to do every day?

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
kinds of tasks that I've

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.876 align:middle line:90%
been focused on really do help.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're with, of course,
award-winning author and writer

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Dan Hurley, talking about
brain power, his book, Smarter.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We just talked a little bit
about the games and what

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:90%
about electrical stimulation?

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.806 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look.

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:10%
REPORTER: He showed
me how his research

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:10%
team builds computer
models to predict

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.052 align:middle line:10%
how current hits the brain.

00:17:08.052 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: And what
you're looking at here

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.385 align:middle line:10%
is what shows up
actually at the brain.

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:10%
Warmer colors represent
more current flow.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:10%
You can see here's one
electrode, here's the other.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:10%
The red square is
the anode electrode

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.054 align:middle line:10%
and the blue square is
the cathode electrode.

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:10%
The simplest way
to think about is

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:10%
the anode is the positive
terminal of the battery

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:10%
and the cathode is the negative
terminal of the battery

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:10%
and your head is the circuit.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:10%
REPORTER: When TDCS is applied
in lab settings like this,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:10%
it's typically no more than
two milliamps of electricity,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:10%
about the amount needed to
power a small LED light bulb.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:10%
The amount that actually
reaches the cortex of the brain

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:10%
after passing through
layers of skin, skull, fat,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and cerebrospinal
fluid is even smaller.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: So what the
brain is being bathed in

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:10%
is actually a very, very low
level of direct current flow

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:10%
passing along the neurons.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:10%
The brain is super
sensitive to electricity

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:10%
because the brain
uses electricity.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:10%
The neurons in the
brain have a voltage

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.919 align:middle line:10%
across them and for
a neuron at rest,

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:10%
which is sort of like a neuron
sitting around and doing

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:10%
nothing, that's around
minus 80 millivolts.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:10%
If that voltage starts to
increase for some reason

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:10%
and if it increases enough to
what's called a threshold that

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:10%
might be around minus 60
millivolts, it on its own

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:10%
then makes a decision to
fire and action potential.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was fascinating.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, do some people
have the ability

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to increase their electrical
power of the brain?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: Well,
George, I actually

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:10%
underwent this procedure of
transcranial direct current

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:10%
stimulation.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
It's being studied
at top universities

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I did it at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
then I went up to a Harvard's
Neurostimulation Laboratory

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and spent five days
getting stimulated.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article about it for
the New York Times Magazine.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it increase?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Absolutely.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
What's really crazy is you
think of this idea of putting

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:84%
electricity on your
head and they think, oh,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
it's shock therapy, you're
going to get zapped.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't even feel it really.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
It's so mild.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to detect.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they start it, you
sort of feel it for a little bit

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and after about 20 seconds,
your mind no longer notices it.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's so mild that
they can do placebo treatments

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.704 align:middle line:84%
by just turning
off the electricity

00:19:37.704 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can't tell
the difference,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:90%
whether it's on or not.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they've done studies showing
this is one of the best ways

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the
effects of training.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you need to be doing
something while you're

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:90%
undergoing the treatment.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:10%
I did it just 15 minutes
a day for five days

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:10%
and I was doing various
brain training games.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:10%
And I got the strongest
jump in my ability

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:10%
while I was doing this.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
somewhere in some government

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
lab they are testing
people to try

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:90%
to increase their brain power?

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: Oh, I know that are.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Naval
Research Laboratory,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
the Office of Naval Research,
and a group called IARPA, which

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
is part of the intelligence--

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like part of DARPA.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: It's like DARPA, which
is the Defense Advanced Project

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Research, but it's for
the intelligence offices--

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
not intelligence like IQ,
intelligence like spies.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And IARPA is for
trying to do research

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that will help America's spying
capacities and intelligence

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are funding
studies and they're

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
funding studies of
TDCs, they're funding

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
studies of brain training,
physical training,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:90%
of mindfulness meditation.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing
great results.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's
been most encouraging to me

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not
just in universities,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that the US military
and intelligence

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
department think
this is something

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:90%
that can really help us.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At one
point, the military

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.250 align:middle line:84%
had a very secret
remote viewing program

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
underway where many
of those participants

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
have been on my radio
show, "Coast to Coast AM."

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But these people were
training to do remote viewing,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to see what the enemy was doing
by letting their minds go out

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:90%
into the space.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Well, yeah.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
The US government wants
to-- I mean anything

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:90%
that can give us an edge.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:84%
What I find really impressive
is that these studies

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:84%
are getting published
in top medical journals.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is considered legitimate,
mainstream, real science

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that-- I mentioned
that I began getting

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
because of research

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:90%
into folks with Down syndrome.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting is that
Defense Department people,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
these are people who are
already high level folks,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:90%
they're already doing great.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And the notion that you can
make them even smarter really

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
makes you stop and go, well,
what is the limit here?

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People with
Alzheimer's disease,

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
which contributes
to loss of memory,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
loss of just about everything
with the brain, what's

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
causing that?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: So people
are still trying,

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
scientists are still
trying to understand that.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I write a lot for
"Neurology Today," which

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:84%
is the newspaper of the
American Academy of Neurology

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and they know what happens when
people start developing it,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
but they still are not
clear on why it happens

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
and what they can do exactly.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a short
circuit in the brain.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean parts of the
brain begin just not--

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.440 align:middle line:90%
you can see decay of the brain.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There is beta amyloid
is almost like literally

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:90%
gumming up the works.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:10%
So brain training regarding for
folks with Alzheimer's and even

00:23:52.690 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:10%
something called mild cognitive
impairment, brain training,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:10%
it's not clear that it will
help people at that level.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:10%
So if you're already--

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It may be too late.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: --going
down the hole, yeah.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But for people that are
simply older adults,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
they've been finding
great effects.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a major study
involved about 3,000 people,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:90%
10-year study.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
They did 10 hours of
training for people.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, they
were still showing

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
major effects on
people's ability,

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:84%
activities of daily living,
their ability to reason.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly,
they showed people

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
who trained in this special way
had half the risk of getting

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.835 align:middle line:90%
in car crashes-- half.

00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:52.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Half?

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:53.435 align:middle line:90%
Dramatic.

00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Half the risk
of getting in a car crash.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is now-- some
insurance companies

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:90%
will offer this to people.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called the useful
field of view training.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
There is a company
called Brain HQ,

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a website
called brainhq.com,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and people can go on
there and do these

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.495 align:middle line:84%
and it really has
been shown to work.

00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about things
like eating blueberries.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:90%
does that help?

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:90%
The taste good.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.893 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: They taste good.

00:25:28.893 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:90%
I love blueberries.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I love fish and
everybody's grandmother

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:90%
said fish is brain food.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
omega, I think.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
There's not any great
scientific evidence

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that this stuff truly works.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
being overweight

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is definitely associated with
reduced abilities, having

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
type 2 diabetes is
going be associated

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:90%
with reduced capacity.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So the total effect
of what you eat

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is more important,
it seems, than

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:90%
the individual ingredients.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean I wouldn't
recommend anyone

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to have a diet of
hamburgers and milkshakes,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
but that's for a
million reasons.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm a
supplement freak, Dan.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yes.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll take
the blueberries,

00:26:32.428 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll take supplements,
I'll do all that.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I also found one
thing, too, that I

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
think early retirement
contributes to the brain

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%
kind of shriveling up.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I have found that in a lot
of people who just retire,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:90%
don't do much.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They seem to break
down a little quicker.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, that's
absolutely the message

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that people need to
understand is that their brain

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:90%
is a living thing.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not
challenging it constantly,

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like a shark, it's got
to keep moving to stay alive.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
If your brain is not getting
challenged, it is shrinking.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It might shrink literally,
but it's definitely

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
going to shrink in capacity.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
be challenging it.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the through
line of all the things

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:90%
that I studied that help.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's doing brain
games on a computer,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:10%
whether it's learning
a musical instrument,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:10%
doing new physical
exercise, you've

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:10%
got to do things that
you're not used to doing.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:10%
Learning novel tasks,
challenging yourself

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:10%
just like you got
challenged back in school.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:10%
That's why it's not an accident
that kids are so sharp.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's that they're
learning every day.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Every day new stuff
is going on, where

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:84%
when you're older
you've been there,

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
you've done that,
everything seems the same.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's time to shake things
up, try something new,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
do something you've
never done before.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some emails
in from a lot of our listeners

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
know what you do.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Darren from South Lake Tahoe
in California says, I'm 72

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm concerned
about my memory.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything I can do at
my age to improve it/ can you

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
improve the memory
of a 72-year-old?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Absolutely.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And memory, per se,
I mean where you

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.570 align:middle line:84%
left your keys is a lot
less important than being

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
able to balance your
checkbook, right?

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you can find your keys,
but if you can't figure things

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
out, make sense of things,
if you can't plan a menu,

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
this is where things
start really getting tough

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:90%
for your life.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is where,
again, trying new things.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Physical exercise is
one of the best ways

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:90%
to improve your mental capacity.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Brain games, I think one of
the best sites is BrainHQ.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
They've got tons of
studies published

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in peer reviewed scientific
literature showing

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:90%
great effects.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going after FDA approval
for some of their treatments.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:90%
There's really good reason.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- a lot of
people heard about Lumosity.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Earlier in January, they
were fined $2 million

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
for making exaggerated
claims and there really

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
are fewer studies supporting
Lumosity, where BrainHQ

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:90%
has a wealth of data behind it.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:10%
And I have no relationship
with either company,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm just telling you
what I know from looking

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:10%
at the scientific literature.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Corinna from
Santa Fe, New Mexico,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:28.550 align:middle line:10%
writes, I have a child who is
struggling in school with ADHD.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:10%
I don't like the medications.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:10%
Can bring training help him?

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yes.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds of
studies now showing that you

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:90%
can help kids with ADHD.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There is also a
research into helping

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
kids who have been afflicted
with diseases, including

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:84%
even cancer, where
chemotherapy and radiation has

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:84%
been shown to really
have significant effects

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:90%
on their IQ.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds
of studies now showing

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:84%
that working memory
training, it's

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:16.030 align:middle line:84%
called working memory training--
there's a program called Cogmed

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's available only
through trained psychologists.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a little pricey.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:10%
I think it's about--
I don't know,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:10%
I think it's about
$2,000 or something.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:34.640 align:middle line:10%
But they take you through
a series of brain training

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:10%
programs on a computer
that you can do at home

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:10%
and it's been shown to
improve working memory.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And BrainHQ is
also good for that.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And I would also suggest
just musical training,

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:84%
physical training,
anything they can

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.230 align:middle line:84%
do to stimulate
themselves and challenge

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.235 align:middle line:90%
themselves is going to help.

00:32:00.235 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, one of the
things I've gone and done

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
for myself, Dan, is I like
to sing at some of my events

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and I have learned that learning
songs, memorizing the words

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and just getting
it down has really

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:90%
helped my brain power as well.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: I learned to
play the Renaissance lute.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Yeah.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I had seen one years
ago when I was in England

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and I heard a guy
playing it and I said,

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that is cool and one day
when I'm bald like that guy,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get a lute.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I never did.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But then when I looked at
the scientific literature,

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:49.925 align:middle line:84%
it says that learning a musical
instrument, musical training

00:32:49.925 --> 00:32:50.725 align:middle line:90%
really--

00:32:50.725 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Singing
or an instrument.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Singing,
an instrument,

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:90%
it really pushes your mind.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about an instrument

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.157 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're holding
the fret board over here

00:33:07.157 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
fingering it over here

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to do all
these things at once,

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that's just like what your
brain is trying to do.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to do
multiple things at once.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:10%
And forcing yourself to
synchronize all those things

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:10%
is a real great challenge.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:10%
So one thing I will say is
just doing the same things

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:10%
over and over.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're still playing
those Beatles songs

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
you learned in 1973,
playing them is fun

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to help
you stay where you are,

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
but if you want to grow,
learn some new stuff.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Try out new instrument or
learn new songs like you do.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Dan,
our final email

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.352 align:middle line:84%
here from Sandy in Sioux
Falls South Dakota,

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to waste
a lot of time doing

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of crazy things.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.160 align:middle line:84%
What's the one kind of brain
training that works the best?

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: I would
try brainhq.com.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
That would probably
be the most efficient.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It's 10, 15 minutes
a day that you

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:22.429 align:middle line:84%
might do for five weeks
three times a week.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
And that's been shown to
have significant benefits.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a computer game and what's
really cool about these games

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and what's really different
about them is instead of just

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:84%
learning a
memorization thing, it

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:84%
makes your brain have to do
things, take what's given,

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and do something with them.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
remembering 1-9-7-5-2,

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to give it backwards or
the numbers are moving forward

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and you have to keep track,
even as the numbers are moving

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:84%
forward, of what the number was
over here as the numbers are

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:84%
still-- so you're kind of
keeping track three units

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:90%
behind.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:90%
These are crazy mind benders.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will make you
want to pick up a computer

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and throw it across your own.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Chess is a great game for
seeing the big picture

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and using strategy.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:90%
That is one of the games.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
that, it's much better

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:90%
than, say, crossword puzzles.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Especially for
people that have done

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
crossword puzzles for years and
think that that's the best way,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
really trying something
new like chess,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
like some of these brain
games, can really help.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with
exercise, with training,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.850 align:middle line:84%
with the right foods
and supplements,

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.890 align:middle line:84%
you really can keep
that brain sharp.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I have seen some
people in their nineties

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:90%
who are absolutely brilliant.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:84%
They're funny, they're
conversational,

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:90%
and they don't act their age.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Right.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed that
conductors, classical music

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
conductors, always seem to
die at like 98 or something?

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Always old, yeah.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:10%
Or comedians.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: Comedians, anyone one
who is really using their mind.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It really helps you keep going.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So to the degree that
you're just checking out

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and figure that
your time is done,

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that's the wrong
attitude to bring.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.809 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be in it.

00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep going.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
then, Dan, there's

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:84%
a connection between the
youthful brain and keeping

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
it young and the
rest of your body.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Absolutely.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Physical exercise is
one of the best ways.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:84%
There are some wonderful
videos that if you search

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:84%
on Google or YouTube
for exercise is power,

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you will find these great videos
created by a scientist, Theresa

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Lou Ambrose.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:21.040 align:middle line:10%
And she has shown that
strength training-- I'm not

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:10%
talking about
lifting 500 pounds,

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:10%
but just doing gentle
weight training that slowly

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.090 align:middle line:10%
increases-- stuff
you can do at home,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:36.840 align:middle line:10%
you don't even have to go
to a gym-- can really help.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean walking,
anything that is just

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
slightly challenging for you
and to keep ramping it up

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.520 align:middle line:90%
as you get better.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the fastest ways
to improve your brain power.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
get a hold of you?

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.711 align:middle line:10%
>>HURLEY: They can go to
my website, danhurley.com.

00:37:57.711 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
My books are available
in bookstores and Amazon.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it works.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think more
people like you need

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to get involved
in helping people,

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.865 align:middle line:84%
sharpening up their skills
and their brain power.

00:38:12.865 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Absolutely.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a shame that
so many kids and people that

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
are struggling and
wanting to do better

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
are not getting the tools
they need to improve.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And scientists are
doing great work

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:90%
to bring this stuff to people.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you read my book, you
can find out all these methods

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.159 align:middle line:90%
that really do work.

00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you're
a parent and your kid

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:84%
wants to play a video
game, should you let them?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HURLEY: Well, video
games in moderation.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:90%
All things in moderation.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Video games can
have, as we said,

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:10%
surprising benefits
for certain aspects

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:10%
of cognition and thinking.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:84%
What really works is
those piano lessons

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that kids hate can also help.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And letting them trying
Cogmed, trying BrainHQ,

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
doing mental math, learning
a musical instrument,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.890 align:middle line:90%
physical exercise.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't forget to let that
kid out and run around and use

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.340 align:middle line:90%
all parts of their body.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Dan, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HURLEY: Thank you, George.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sharpen your
brain, sharpen your life.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:10%
It's that simple.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and
this is "Beyond Belief."
