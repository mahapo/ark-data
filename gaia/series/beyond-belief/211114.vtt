>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Paul Perry's with us, a "New
York Times" best-selling

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:10%
author who has written more than
15 books just on the subject

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
of near-death experiences.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
He's also a
documentary filmmaker

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and a darn good
one with the goal

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:90%
of making media that matters.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And you are doing that, Paul.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL PERRY: I'm working on it.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.617 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
How'd you get
started in all this?

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: In writing?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Writing itself.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I started
out as I wanted

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to be a marine biologist,
and I was going to college.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:10%
And I was in a summer
class, and I had a--

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:10%
I was doing a fish experiment.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And my professor at the time--

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I had to turn in a paper.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
He read the paper and he
said, this is really good,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
you should start writing.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.912 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: So I had
nothing to do, and I just

00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:10%
wrote a couple of articles
for "The Arizona Republic,"

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and I made some money.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
And there's-- nothing
motivates a writer like money.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I just kept
writing and kept selling.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I just set
a plan for my life,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.847 align:middle line:84%
how I wanted to get
to be a book author.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're partners
with Dannion Brinkley

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:90%
on a project?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That's correct.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We're working on a
project, a TV project.

near-death experiences three

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.188 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I'll tell you.

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how many
people are struck by lightning.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.883 align:middle line:90%
Like, hundreds of people.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought, well,
Danny was one of the few

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.033 align:middle line:84%
that had been, but
in fact, not at all.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
book with Raymond Moody,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think the
world of that guy.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah, I think
the world of Raymond too.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.635 align:middle line:84%
I have five books with
Raymond, and this will be--

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
cover of it, right?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That's it.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:10%
This will be the
fifth book, I believe.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: "7 Reasons to
Believe in Life after Life."

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.572 align:middle line:10%
Were you always a believer
in the other side?

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: You know, I spent a
lot of years not even thinking

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to think
more and more about it,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, I don't
know that this can be possible.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
introduced to Raymond.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to write
a book for Raymond.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He'll change your mind.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: And he will.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
He's such a pleasant person,
and he doesn't push anything.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
He just says, this is how it is,
and you can believe it or not.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had my doubts years
ago about life after death.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes-- part of me
figured this dark end of life,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:90%
this is it.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But then listening to people
like Raymond Moody and Dannion

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Brinkley, I began to think, no.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
something to this.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:90%
This is not just coincidental.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in coincidences.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not accidental.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Right.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something going on there.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.785 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a staunch believer
in the other side.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I'm a staunch
believer-- pretty much

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:90%
a staunch believer now.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
If I had to assign
it from 1 to 100,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I would probably say I'm a 90%--

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%
90% believer.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very high.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That's pretty high.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.442 align:middle line:90%
But there's always doubt.

00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
There's always doubt
with this, because it's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
a very difficult subject, to
come up with 100% proof on.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What came first,
us or the other side?

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Wow.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I would say the other side
would almost have to be first.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Because someone
created all of this stuff.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I know the current science
says that it just happened,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and it happened in certain ways.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I keep hearing things about
lightning striking boulders

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:90%
and creating a living form.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The living form over billions of
years becomes us, sitting here.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's hard-- that's
harder for me to believe

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.902 align:middle line:90%
than a, if you will, creation.

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the afterlife is, Paul?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.843 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It's very
hard to define.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I do--

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
I do believe we were created.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I do believe--

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it God, because
I don't know whether--

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For lack of a
better phrase, I guess.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Sure, that
we are created by God.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.055 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what Heaven--

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I do have an idea of
what Heaven looks like--

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Hell?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I do have an idea
with that-- what that looks

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
like as well, because through
near-death experiences, which

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
are considered
gateway experiences,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.015 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you
can go to the-- you

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
can go to the gates of Heaven,
but you can't go beyond.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how it is with
near-death experiences.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So you hear people
describe Heaven.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard so many
people describe Heaven

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.477 align:middle line:84%
that I am inclined
to believe that that

00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:90%
is what Heaven looks like.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.782 align:middle line:84%
But what God has planned
for us, I have no idea.

00:04:52.782 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, what
do you think is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest convincing
arguments for the existence

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
of the other side?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, I
mean, we touch it--

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
we deal with that in
this book, but what's

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
out there on the other
side, I don't have any idea.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm sorry to say that.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I should have
developed a pat answer by now,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have one.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And I also know
that Raymond rarely

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:90%
can express a pat answer.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:90%
He says, I do believe in God.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
God created us.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I do believe he
has a plan for us,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
what that plan is.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
all faith-based?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, not at all.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Raymond is not what I
call a Bible thumper.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: At all.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's not.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Never has been.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But he has a really
strong base in philosophy,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and he feels that the
proof of life after death

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.373 align:middle line:84%
will come from
philosophy, not science.

00:05:54.373 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
very convincing.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
If you had to take
this into court,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
he's the guy you'd want to
bring in there with you.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I would think so, yeah.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's a shared
death experience, Paul?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It's when
a person who is well

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
shares the death experience
of a person who's dying.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.083 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
there's a number of types of--

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give us an example.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: --shared
death experiences.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But what that means is that we
have some examples where there

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
have been families with
eight or more people,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:84%
for instance, who are at
the deathbed of a loved one,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and they will all experience
the same experience

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:90%
that he might be describing.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, I just--

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I just saw my wife,
and they'll be seeing--

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%
they'll be seeing that.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll be seeing
his life review.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
People reliving a person's
life review with them

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:90%
is very common.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these shared
death experiences common?

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They're way more
common than I thought they were.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they have
slipped definition in the past.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't show
up in any medical books.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They aren't called
shared death experiences.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Until about 10 years
ago, Raymond and I

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
decided to write a book on
shared death experiences,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.777 align:middle line:84%
and we wrote just a tiny book
called "Glimpses of Eternity."

00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
got a clip of you

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Moody talking about
these shared death experiences.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Sure.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
What I find exciting
about the shared death

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
experience is that
many of the traits

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death experience
are the same as the traits

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of the shared death experience,
which means in a lot of ways,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.878 align:middle line:90%
the research merges.

00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: Oh, yes.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
There is a complete overlap
between the elements

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
of what we already know as
the near-death experience

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and what we now know are
shared death experiences.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:90%
They have the same elements.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
People who are at the bedside
of the dying, for example,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
tell us that however
articulate they may be,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
that they just
simply have no words

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:90%
for what they experienced.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But very often, they
talk about a sound

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
around the bedside of the dying,
very often beautiful music.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
They talk about this light.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Very often, I've
heard people tell me

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
that they feel that they
accompanied their dying loved

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
one partway toward this light.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They may have accounts of seeing
the relatives of the deceased

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
around the bedside of the
dying, or in this light,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:90%
taking the dying person away.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And most remarkably
of all, Paul,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I have an appreciable
number of cases

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of people who tell me
that they empathically

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
co-lived the panoramic life
review of the person who

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:90%
was dying.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And to add all this
up, what this amounts

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to is a positive refutation,
I would say, of the notion

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
that near-death
experiences are simply

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
the hallucinatory
effects of brain damage

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
in effect of the dying person,
because if that were true,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
if these near-death
experiences were simply

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:84%
the biochemistry of the brain
going berserk in a dying brain,

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
why would the bystanders have
identically the same stories?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Sure.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And these
stories are nothing new.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:90%
They go back into remote times.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have been hearing
these since 1972.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was the
first one I heard.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.483 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: See, that's
one of the things

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that I find most exciting
about near-death experiences

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and shared death experiences, is
that they're as old as mankind.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.035 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yes.

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And what you've
done is you've essentially

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
dissected these experiences
so people can understand them

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.925 align:middle line:84%
and they can be studied for
their component parts, right?

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: That's
absolutely right.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.967 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: But in fact,
it's not something

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:04.255 align:middle line:90%
you made up or created.

00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that's been--

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that you were really the
first one to take a look at.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's so spot-on Paul.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Shared death
experiences may indeed

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
be the evidence
you're looking for

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
to prove the existence of it.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.813 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I definitely
think they are.

00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting when he talks
about the history of shared

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
death experiences, because they
go all the way back to Plato.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.362 align:middle line:84%
If you read Plato's "Republic,"
in the end, he deals with--

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had one of those.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He had a guy in
there named the soldier of Er,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and the soldier of
Er was supposedly

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:90%
killed on the battlefield.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But as they were about to burn
all these bodies of soldiers

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
who'd been killed, he
came out of the crowd.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
He got up and started talking
about what he had shared

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.942 align:middle line:90%
with other people during death.

00:10:54.942 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is an amazing
phenomenon, isn't it?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
How prevalent is it?

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: We don't know.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with a
near-death experience--

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
we know it happens.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah, it
definitely happens.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.695 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the big difference
between near-death experiences

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and shared death, but let's
deal with that for a minute.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: For every 100 people
who have a heart attack where

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
they have a cardiac
arrest, 15 to 20 of them

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:90%
have a near-death experience.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
how many have had

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
shared death experiences because
there's no study on that.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a lot more
time now to build up cases

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and to find--

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.523 align:middle line:90%
and to do the research on those.

00:11:38.523 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It's more difficult to research
a shared death experience.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The person
doing the sharing

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
with the person who had
the death experience,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
do they necessarily have
to be close to that person?

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Originally, we
thought that they had

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to be a loved one of
the person who dies,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but now they're just
coming out of the woodwork.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are talking about
shared death experiences.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
aspects of death.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
They've opened up the definition
of shared death experience,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it that
kicks it into high gear,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.128 align:middle line:90%
makes it happen?

00:12:14.128 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Don't know that.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got to be
a catalyst to it somehow.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It's exasperating, OK?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing is it's nice
to be at the bedside of someone

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:90%
who's dying.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
There appears to
be more when you're

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
at the bedside than
a precognitive--

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
be close by physically?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.235 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: That's what
it appears to be.

00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:37.028 align:middle line:84%
There were studies
done on these--

00:12:37.028 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
on some of these, a
different angle on them

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century by the
Society for Psychical Research.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was
they put out feelers

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to people who had died
with their loved ones,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we want
to know what happened,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
if anything that could fit into
a paranormal category happened.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was that
people were seeing light,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing mist, and
they were hearing music.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: So there's
all these great reports

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
from the 19th
century that people

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
talk about being at the
bedside of a loved one

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and they would hear
a mysterious music,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
and no one could find the music.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
The music seemed to just
emanate from the air.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
would last for days.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's about seven
different sides of shared death

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.507 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what they are?

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Can you--

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I do.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.892 align:middle line:84%
And I have a cheat
sheet on it, so I'll--

00:13:39.892 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
through each one.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: OK.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:84%
A confirmable
out-of-body experience.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Seeing light, mist, and
music at a person's bedside.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.703 align:middle line:84%
There's one called
terminal lucidity,

00:13:50.703 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and we'll discuss
that in a while.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a fairly new experience.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
People who are transformed by
their near-death experience.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The key there is, we
aren't transformed,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
but we see the
transformation in them.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be able to witness
the effect of their death

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
an immediate thing?

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oftentimes, it is.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And oftentimes it goes on.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:90%
It never leaves them.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So for example, just
two days ago I was at--

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to an
emergency room nurse

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
at the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, and I said,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard of
a near-death experience?

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And she told about a
patient she had had 10 or 15

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
years ago who had
a cardiac arrest,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and when he came
out of it, he talked

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:90%
about the power of this light.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, he couldn't get
the light out of his head

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that he saw.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:84%
She then talked to
him again a week

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
or so ago during a
checkup, and he started

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
talking again about the light.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
He started weeping, how much
it had changed his life.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: OK.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is a great one.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Divine creativity.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: We have a great
example of that in the book.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:90%
We have two, actually.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This one is from an orthopedic
surgeon in Syracuse named Tony

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Cicoria, and he was
out playing golf,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and he realized it was Sunday,
and he had to call his mother.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:84%
He always called his
mother on Sunday.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So he got to a payphone,
and he calls her up.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
pre-cell phones, I guess.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Pre-cell phones.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.345 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the audience knows
what a payphone is, but anyway.

00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think there's
two left in the country.

00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah, right.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he gets
on this payphone,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and he's struck by lightning.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The lightning hit him
in the side of the face

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and came out his foot.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And he had a classic
near-death experience.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%
The woman who was waiting for--

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to make a call behind
him luckily was a nurse

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and she CPR'd him back to life.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.675 align:middle line:90%
He'd be dead.

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He would
have been dead.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So he spent a week or
so in the hospital,

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and about two weeks later
he said he had this urge

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to play the piano.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
That's all he wanted to
do is play the piano.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And he had had piano
lessons as a child,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:90%
but nothing since then.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And he bought a
piano, and then he

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
started to have dreams of
playing in concert halls.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he Mozart, or what?

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Well, probably Mozart.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:90%
He's probably there already.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he started
studying piano,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and since then he's
played at Lincoln Center.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
He's played at concert halls
in Germany, Austria, France.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's still a surgeon, but
he's a remarkable pianist.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's because of this event.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a share-- we call it
a shared death experience

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
because we can all see the
change that took place.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.067 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah, it's
very, very dramatic.

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We can't, of course,
experience the same desire

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:90%
to play the piano.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
possibilities?

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Precognitive
experiences.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Melvin Morse, one of the
doctors I've written books with,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
he woke up in the
middle of the night

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
when he was in his residency,
and standing at the foot

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:90%
of his bed was his father.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who had died?

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, he
didn't know it.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he didn't know it?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.623 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And his
father said, you need

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:11.324 align:middle line:90%
to call your mother right away.

00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:13.151 align:middle line:90%
I've left messages for you.

00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't
get through to him

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
because he had
turned his phone off.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And so he calls his mother,
and his mother tells him,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:90%
your father just died.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.698 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very typical
precognitive experience.

00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's saying,
that's impossible, Mom.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Dad was right here.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I had
another one with--

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you her name,
but a really big-time producer

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:90%
in Hollywood.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And she was on the East
Coast visiting her boyfriend.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
She started to get
nervous and edgy

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and started to think
about her family.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's in bed with this
friend of mine, Barry,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and he was nervous.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:90%
He started to get nervous.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
father appeared above them.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hovering?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Hovering above them and
just hovering, saying nothing.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And so she-- after
he disappeared,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
she immediately called her
mother, and her mother in LA

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
said that her father had died.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
As with most of
these experiences,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
it didn't scare her at all.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:90%
She said--

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem very
comfortable with this.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.512 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They're
comfortable with it.

00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Even though it
sounds really freaky,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
to the person who experiences
it, it's generally not.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was always
comfortable with my father.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:90%
We were very close.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.685 align:middle line:90%
So where else would he go?

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend
Raymond Moody

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
talked about the first
time he was convinced

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:90%
about life after death.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: About two years ago,
I had an experience that really

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
brought me to the point where
I had to just sort of go on

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, yeah, apparently
there is life after death.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
cases like this,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but I will use an illustrative
one to illustrate the problem.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So about two years ago, I met
this really interesting guy

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
who's an artist who had a
near-death experience when

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
he was in a horrific car crash.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And he lost one leg and his
wife was killed instantly

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:90%
in the accident.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But he was so moved and changed
by this near-death experience

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
he had that he
started writing it up,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
which I encouraged him
to do, my thinking being

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
that artists process things
by that kind of activity.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it would
be a good thing for him.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So about two years ago, he
sent me his finished book,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
which was really good.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Then less than two
weeks later, he

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:84%
called me back and said that in
reading through his own book,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
he had mentioned the name
of the trauma surgeon

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:90%
who saved his life.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So he thought, well,
this is kind of impolite.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So he contacted
the trauma surgeon

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and invited him to lunch.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the doctor came, he
related to him the near-death

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
experience he had had,
whereupon the doctor said--

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
after becoming very
solemn said, yeah, well,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
when you were in
the operating room,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in contact with
your wife, that he

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:90%
felt the presence of the wife.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And then as this came
forward, then the nurse

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:84%
spoke up who was
involved and reported

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of experience.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So at that point
in my thinking, I'm

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to put this case
together and to come up

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
with some other scenario
that doesn't involve

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:90%
the notion of an afterlife.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I consciously felt myself trying
to run away and rationalize

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and escape rather
than just saying

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
what seems to be
straightforwardly the case.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So this has brought me
around to the opinion--

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
or not so much as the
opinion as the assessment,

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:84%
if I can put it that way,
the assessment that there's

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:90%
life after death.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't he soothing?

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.555 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He's
wonderful to talk to.

00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely wonderful.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I
mean, he really makes

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
you feel as if the death
experience is pleasant.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, yeah.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of a kind.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: You know,
what's interesting here

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
is that you hear a shared
death experience that

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:90%
seems impossible.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.720 align:middle line:10%
This one seemed impossible.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:10%
And then you start to hear the
same type somewhere else right.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
Raymond was in Italy,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and he was giving
a conference there.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And when he finished, a doctor
pulled him aside and said,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I've had this experience, and I
don't know what to make of it.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing a routine
surgery on somebody,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
if there is such a
thing, and the man coded.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:90%
His heart stopped.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was dying.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And the doctor
immediately started to CPR him,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and he went on for quite a
while, and then he decided--

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's useless.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Be useless.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:90%
So he stopped.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And into the operating room
blasting through the door

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
was the man's wife.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And she said, keep pumping.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:90%
He just talked to me--

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
he just talked to me
in the waiting room.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.732 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He came to see me and
said, tell him to keep going.

00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't give up.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.997 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: So the doctor
kept going and--

00:22:32.997 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brought him back?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: --he was revived.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: So in that case of
a shared death experience,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
you have at least
three witnesses,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
not counting the people who
were in the operating room.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, what
is terminal lucidity?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: That's-- it's
kind of fascinating.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It has been around for
thousands of years.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
with a lot of these

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
is nobody has ever
named or defined them,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
so doctors don't
pick up on them.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And no one-- no one
categorized-- they

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:90%
aren't categorized.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
No one keeps records
on them, on and on.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.117 align:middle line:84%
So that's all changed in
the last 10 years or so.

00:23:12.117 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it mean, though?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Terminal lucidity?

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.355 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, it
means-- it just

00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:90%
it's a play off its own words.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Terminal, it's someone who's
terminal, dying, and possibly

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:90%
has no brain waves.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or has died.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Pretty much.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And they become lucid.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:90%
They become lucid again.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:90%
They get all their energy back.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They start talking like they
never were close to death

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:90%
They get up.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I've actually
witnessed one myself.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gives
them that burst?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, that isn't
known, but then they usually

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
die within hours, which is
disappointing for their family

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.868 align:middle line:84%
if their family's there, because
the old person has come back.

00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They peak and
then they die again?

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They peak
and they die again.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.903 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they last--

00:23:53.903 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the longest
one I've heard

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:90%
lasted maybe about two days.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.478 align:middle line:84%
But this time,
the death is real.

00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: This time
the death is real.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's an unknown
source for the energy.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, the
National Institutes of Health

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:84%
have started
researching, the NIH

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
started researching terminal
lucidity because so many people

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
who have Alzheimer's
experience it,

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and so many people who have
brain tumors experience it.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
know what it is,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
if there's some way they
can draw on that energy

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to get people past
Alzheimer's, for instance.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
commonality among these people?

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:90%
No, they can be very old people.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:90%
They can be young people.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The episodes
are different?

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.193 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Episodes are different.

00:24:41.193 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The one I witnessed before
it was even named-- it

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.502 align:middle line:84%
wasn't named until 10
years ago, actually.

00:24:46.502 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
does this relate

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:90%
to out-of-body experiences?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It doesn't
necessarily relate

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:52.895 align:middle line:90%
to out-of-body experiences.

00:24:52.895 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The one I saw was a man in
a hospital in Scottsdale,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was visiting a friend
across the hall from this guy.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:90%
This guy was-- he had dementia.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.442 align:middle line:84%
They said he was going
to die within hours.

00:25:06.442 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The guy
in the other room?

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: In the other room.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.682 align:middle line:84%
They said he was going
to die within hours.

00:25:10.682 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:90%
His family had a vigil going on.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And then they went home.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.220 align:middle line:90%
They went home to bed.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
I came there,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and he was standing
on top of his bed

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
with his family
sitting around him.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:90%
They're all weeping.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
He's talking and talking
and making sense and talking

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
about family business
and how wonderful

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:90%
it is to make a comeback--

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Standing up in bed?

00:25:34.717 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Standing up in bed.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And then he passed away.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Then within an hour
or so, he died.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
die so quickly after--

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They know so little--
they know so little about this.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the
dying process that makes

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
them revive for one last stand?

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: They can't say.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.903 align:middle line:84%
What the people in our
field say is that--

00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
people in our field

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
with this particular--

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
with terminal lucidity-- is
that somehow, consciousness

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
has separated from the body, and
that consciousness is now alive

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
again where the brain is dead
in the person who's had it.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's now the
outside consciousness

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that's doing the speaking,
doing the communicating.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Luis Minero shared some
of his out-of-body experiences

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:84%
with the souls from
Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LUIS MINERO: Just seeing the
preparation that some people

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
undergo before being reborn,
because there are many people--

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and many people I would
say, when they are here

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
in the physical reality they
feel like they were born

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to do something, like they have
a life purpose, a life task,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And to a very great
extent, it seems

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that that feeling comes because
they prepared themselves

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.692 align:middle line:90%
for those tasks or lessons or--

00:27:01.692 --> 00:27:02.942 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Previously.

00:27:02.942 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Previously,
before being born, you know?

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So it is interesting
to leave the body

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.577 align:middle line:84%
and to see those people
preparing for those tasks.

00:27:11.577 --> 00:27:13.285 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, tell
us what that's like.

00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:14.085 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Some of
those realities--

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
first of all, some
of those, they

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:84%
can look like almost
like a university class,

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:84%
like a course that
people are undertaking.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are classes in
some of these dimensions,

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
basically for any topic to
try to understand deeper

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
the physical body or the
energetic body, for example,

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
or trying to study concepts
more like ethics and openness

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and assistance.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
big thing, just

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
helping contributing
with the world.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So just trying to
understand the value of,

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have some
resources or I produce

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:90%
some resources in my work.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK for me to give them to
somebody else for contribution?

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:90%
And how much?

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Or how much is my capacity
to be able to contribute

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:90%
with the world?

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I say this because
of course, maybe

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
for some people
this seems obvious,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
but for other people they
think, wait a second.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I produce,
I want to keep.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And to a certain
extent, when you

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:90%
leave the body, one of the--

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm here going to start mixing
a lot of topics if that's OK.

00:28:22.942 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's
fine, go for it.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.067 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: One of the
things that happens

00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is that you bump into
the spirit guides,

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and then you start
realizing, look.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
are donating so much

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of their resources,
time, knowledge--

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Energy.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: --energy.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like anybody's
paying them for that

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.325 align:middle line:90%
or anybody's--

00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
or somebody's telling them,
hey, you have to go help them.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So somehow in the
evolution of the soul,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
they learned at some moment,
look, contribution, assistance

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:90%
is a very big thing.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a very big
part of evolution.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
preparing themselves

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
or are trying to
study and understand

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
more this idea of
contribution and assistance.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they come to
their physical life,

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
put it into practice.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about what you

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.264 align:middle line:90%
think about that experience.

00:29:11.264 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Well, you
know, [LAUGHS] I

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book a couple years
ago called "Dying to Wake Up,"

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.175 align:middle line:10%
and it was with an Indian
doctor, Rajiv Parti.

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I like that title.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.883 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Yeah, it's
a wonderful title.

00:29:22.883 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And Raj had an infection
in his abdomen,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and it had seeped
out into his body.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
He was coming down--
he was getting sepsis

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:90%
and he was close to dying.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had a near-death
experience at the time

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that he was at UCLA
hospital and they

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.753 align:middle line:84%
were cleaning--
swabbing his insides out

00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of the infection.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he dies.

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: He dies.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And while he's on
the other side,

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:90%
he's greeted by two angels.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could
see that happening.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And the
angels spoke to him.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.320 align:middle line:84%
They told him-- they told
him what to do with his life.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:84%
He was an anesthesiologist
and he owned a pain clinic.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you need to
quit being an anesthesiologist

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and quit being involved
in pain clinics

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and you need to start practicing
consciousness-based medicine.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.515 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: But they
didn't tell him

00:30:18.515 --> 00:30:20.403 align:middle line:84%
what consciousness-based
medicine is.

00:30:20.403 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had to figure
that out on his own?

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: That's
what they told him.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.405 align:middle line:84%
They said, you have to
figure this out on your own.

00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And since then, he is able to
meditate these angels back,

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and he communes with these
angels in person at least

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:90%
once a week--

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: --where he meditates.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you wrote the
book "Proof" with Raymond Moody,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
did you learn things about
Raymond you didn't know before?

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I did.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I actually did.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I learned a really
interesting story.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a precognitive
experience, and it

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
happened-- he said it was
the worst day of his life

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.778 align:middle line:84%
and the most amazing
day of his life.

00:30:56.778 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Worst day of his life.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.945 align:middle line:90%
What happened to him?

00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, his
wife was pregnant,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and they were about to
have a child sometime

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:90%
within the next couple of weeks.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said at
exactly the same time

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night, they both sat

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
up and recited the same
dream, that their child

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:90%
was going to be--

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.215 align:middle line:90%
was going to die.

00:31:21.215 --> 00:31:22.357 align:middle line:90%
She would lose the child.

00:31:22.357 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, what
a horrible thing to feel.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And he said that
within two or three days,

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what happened.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Child died?

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Child died.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the most amazing--

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:90%
and I can see why it would be--

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you explain this?

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I-- well,
the way I explain it--

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's the way a
lot of other people explain it

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because we just
can't figure it out--

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is that there's some
kind of an energy

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:55.090 align:middle line:84%
release at the point of
death, and that energy release

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.158 align:middle line:90%
goes out to people.

00:31:56.158 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he picked this
up before the death, right?

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, it was a
precognitive experience.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:84%
He picked it up before,
but that all fits

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
into the whole field of
shared death experiences.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, my theory
is, Paul, that we

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.130 align:middle line:90%
are in a wireless network.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected,
you to me, me to you,

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:90%
you to Dannion Brinkley.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's connected.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
that you're on that link,

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that wavelength, all
these things happen,

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it's precognition
about an event or a person.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is, you're there.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.468 align:middle line:84%
You're already--
and it's happening.

00:32:34.468 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, that fits into
another belief that a lot

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of the researchers have, and
that is that it's-- they call

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:90%
it the background theory.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And the background theory is
that we get so much information

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:52.300 align:middle line:84%
into our brain on a daily
basis that we can't--

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that what happens
at a point of death

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:84%
is somehow that information
gets filtered down

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to what is really
important, which

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
in this case-- in these cases
would be the death of a loved

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
one or the death of
someone who's close to you.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, what
is psychomanteum?

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: A psychomanteum is
something the Greeks used,

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.750 align:middle line:84%
ancient Greeks, where they
would have a warren of caves,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and people would go in and
they would spend hours,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:90%
they would spend days.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
There's record of
people spending

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
months in these dark caves to
become totally desensitized

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Putting them
on a different level.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yes.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.313 align:middle line:84%
And then when they were
ready, priests would come in,

00:33:38.313 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and they would decide
that certain people were

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
ready to go into the gazing
room, crystal gazing room.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Or in this case, it was water.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The gazing room, huh?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: So you would
have a room that was high.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It was high.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle was
a big bronze cauldron

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:58.290 align:middle line:84%
filled with water and then
topped off with olive oil.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:04.033 align:middle line:84%
And when it would still, people
would gaze into the cauldron,

00:34:04.033 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and they would think
about the loved one

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to see
to cure their grief.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Because grief-- most
people have grief.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they ask
is for five more minutes.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I just want five more minutes
with the person who just died.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this would give them
five more minutes, if not more.

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They would gaze into
the water and they

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:90%
would see their loved one.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they reported
that a loved one

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
would come out of the water.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:84%
They would talk to them or
they would psychically connect.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:90%
So Raymond studied this.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Raymond went to Greece
and he looked at-- there's

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these oracles.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:84%
He went there and he
studied all the oracles.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
Studied all the writing on it.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.489 align:middle line:84%
And then he went
back home to Alabama

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and created his own
psychomanteum in a dark room

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
with a mirror that's offset
a little bit so you're

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:84%
staring into a clear depth,
and a couple candles.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And he would prepare the
people for the psychomanteum.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:84%
He would do it by
having them bring

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:90%
photographs of loved ones.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:84%
He would talk to them
for sometimes hours.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:84%
He would-- it was
a no-caffeine day.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:90%
No one could have any caffeine.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
They would go out
and take a walk.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Raymond's a big believer in
walking stirring up things

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
mentally.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In those
videos, he seemed like--

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.827 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, yeah.

00:35:25.827 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
come back and they

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:32.280 align:middle line:84%
would sit in the psychomanteum
and stare at the mirror,

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
gaze at the mirror, and hope
that they saw a relative

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:84%
or whoever it was
they wanted to see.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.155 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:35:40.155 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They see somebody?

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.238 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, they see--

00:35:42.238 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:84%
they'll generally see the
person they came to see.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they don't.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:90%
They see another person.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people,
though, claim

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that the person they wanted
to see comes out of the mirror

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and will come out.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel
them sometimes.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
They'll put they'll put
their hands on them.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Other people have no experience
in the psychomanteum,

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:84%
but when they go back
to the hotel they're

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.768 align:middle line:84%
visited by the person that
they wanted to see in the--

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
speaking of the hotel,

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
we've got a couple pictures
I want to look at and have

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:15.890 align:middle line:90%
you explain to us.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Sure.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's orbs
in a hotel room.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Right.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it just a refraction?

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: No, this is at
3:30 in the afternoon.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And a woman came from
Argentina with her sister.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see the woman's
daughter who had passed away,

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
like, 90 days earlier.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So they went through the
psychomanteum process

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and nothing happened,
so they decided

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:90%
to go back to the hotel.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And they went back.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:84%
They were sitting in
their room talking

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
about what had transpired--
why nothing had transpired.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there are-- three orbs

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.380 align:middle line:90%
appeared in the room.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of them.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It was at 3:30 in the afternoon.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It was not at night.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't at a creepy hour.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It was middle of the day.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:10.285 align:middle line:84%
And it started to move around
the room, these three orbs did.

00:37:10.285 --> 00:37:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big were they?

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They were about the
size of a bigger beach ball.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And this one came over and
fixed in front of the woman,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and the woman felt
that she could talk,

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:84%
communicate with her daughter
that was inside this orb.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, her sister
snapped a couple of photos.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:84%
You can see she's
no photographer.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:37:36.925 --> 00:37:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: --she
took these photos.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I've been trying to
convince-- here's another one.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Here's two, actually.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:90%
One on top of the other.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
Raymond Moody's psychomanteum,

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:90%
so let's take a look.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, yeah, that's great.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Independently,
all over the world

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and literally from
prehistoric times,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
people discovered
that when they gazed

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.730 align:middle line:84%
into a clear pond of
water, they would see,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:90%
of course, their own reflection.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But as they gazed
longer and longer,

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.530 align:middle line:84%
they would see
other things appear,

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:84%
specifically spirits, sometimes
spirits of their departed loved

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, they
realized that it

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to be a clear pond.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
They could do the same
thing with a polished metal

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:31.510 align:middle line:84%
bowl filled with olive oil and
placed in an illuminated room

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:90%
by candlelight.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Then later still
they learned they

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:84%
could do the same thing by
gazing into a polished mirror.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, this insight
was institutionalized

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:84%
into amazing places called
oracles of the dead,

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
most famously in Greece as
described in "The Odyssey"

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:90%
by Homer.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.710 align:middle line:84%
People would take
long pilgrimages

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to these oracles of the
dead and the expectation

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of seeing and visiting
and interacting

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.860 align:middle line:90%
with their departed loved ones.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge was
all over the world,

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.460 align:middle line:84%
notably in Japan, for example,
where the oracles of the dead

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:84%
were built over
clear ponds of water

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:84%
with high arched
bridges over the ponds.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And people would sit around
on the shore of the ponds

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.520 align:middle line:84%
reflecting and
talking and thinking

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:90%
about their departed loved ones.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Then they would walk
out over these bridges

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and gaze down into
the water, and they

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:84%
would see the spirits of
their departed loved ones

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.950 align:middle line:84%
rise up from the water
and sometimes have

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
lengthy and elaborate
conversations with them.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:84%
In the modern world, we've
rediscovered how to do this,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is the amazing process
called the psychomanteum.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
room there that--

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah, it's
quite a room, actually.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it scary?

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No, it's not.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:10%
It's very hopeful.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:10%
When my father died, I went into
it, and I had an experience.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.518 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel
something when you're in there?

00:40:11.518 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It's really--
it's very different.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean with my particular
instance, I was seated,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:10%
looking at the mirror.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I was on a pier

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
with my father looking
out at the water.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.670 align:middle line:84%
The water was very dark
and metallic-looking.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at each
other, but said nothing,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and then it was over.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But when it was over,
I had this sense

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:90%
that he was in a good place.

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:84%

being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shared death
experiences, they're

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:84%
happening more than
I ever thought.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:10%
I just hope one day
when it happens to me,

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm on the other
end of the sharing.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
