00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Geraldine Orozco is with us,
an epigenetic psychotherapist

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:10%
and hypnotherapist.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
She experienced life-changing
ET contact back around 2013.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And in 2017, hypnosis
revealed a lifelong history

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:90%
of interdimensional encounters.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, she helps others
integrate their ET experiences,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
facilitating healing of
the mind, body, and soul.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Geraldine, welcome
to the program.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GERALDINE OROZCO: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to
be here, George.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
incredible background.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, how did
this all start for you?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:10%
So I'm a lifelong
contactee, and I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:10%
come from a very
spiritual family,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:10%
so I've been meditating
since I was very young.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But at the age of five, I
had my first experience.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And I began to notice
these experiences happening

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:10%
throughout my life,
but not really knowing

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:10%
to link the word alien or ET
with these interdimensional

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:10%
contacts and connections.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why you?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Why you?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, I don't think
there's anything special at all.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
We are multidimensional
beings in reality.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And we actually are
constantly moving in and out

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:90%
of many, many dimensions.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just a matter of
learning how to quiet the mind,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to begin to observe other
dimensional things that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
are surrounding us--
nature, beings, entities,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and that is available
to every single person.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, your
parents are human, right?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.728 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are very much.

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they know
what was happening to you?

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, it wasn't
talked about in my family.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
We talked a lot about
spiritual things.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I studied with them
Buddhism, Zen meditation.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:84%
Every religion, we
explored as a family.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I became
older, in my early 20s,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that's when I really dove deep
into the topic of spiritual

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:90%
connection, my own journey.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And in 2013, when I
had the experience,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that was the first
time that I actually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
shared with them what
was happening to me.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they say?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.225 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, it
turned out that they

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:90%
had also lifelong experiences.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked to hear
that because I've never

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
heard them talk about
interdimensional beings.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
could be the reason--

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that could be exactly the
reason why they were coming

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.472 align:middle line:90%
to you because of the family.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Well, that's right.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Part of my research in the
work that I do as a therapist

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:90%
is working with experiencers.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm discovering that
actually contact experience

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
runs down the family lineage.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Many families, depending
on where they're from,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
their culture, their
background, they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
seem to hold very strong
ties to specific star groups.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:90%
That's encoded in our DNA.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
It's in the memory of our DNA.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Geraldine
as a five-year-old,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:90%
you had this missing time.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.227 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, I've had
several experiences.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But at five years old,
I was taken on board

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
a craft, where implants
were put into my body.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was also taken into
remote viewing environments.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into a cave and
put into water, blindfolded,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and I was used for my psychic
abilities at a young age

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
already to remote
view different things.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And for me, at that time,
I thought that it was just

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
incredibly vivid dreams.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
later that I began

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
these are actually

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
out of body experiences, that
I'm remembering and recalling

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:90%
as marker memories.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a little
five-year-old girl,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:90%
did they treat you well?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, yes,
there was nothing terrible

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
or traumatizing during
these experiences.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think mostly, it's
because I didn't quite

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
understand what was happening.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
And as a child,
having the abilities

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to see things
multidimensionally,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't something
that was strange to me.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that was normal.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't something out of
the ordinary for me as a child.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're a
pretty prolific painter.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And throughout
this program, we're

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be looking
at a lot of depictions

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have brought us, that
you can explain to us about what

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But to answer this for me
first, Geraldine, these beings,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:90%
what did they look like?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, I've seen
many beings up until now.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But as a child,
I saw beings that

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
looked like Draco, Draconian
type beings, very large beings,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
very muscular, a kind of mix of
some kind of humanoid reptile,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
large kind of being,
with horns in their face.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also saw many Greys,
mantids, other light beings

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So many, many different
species throughout my childhood

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and then later into the
hybridization program,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
which I can explain
in just a moment.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's look at one

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of the first pictures of the
stills that you've sent us

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and see how this
inspired your event.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.775 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the first experiences

00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that I had as a child.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I was taken on board a craft.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
hybridization craft.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It kind of looks like a
honeycomb, so to speak,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
with many layers.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
In one of the floors,
as I'm entering

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the room, that's me on the
very bottom, on the right, mid.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The little, tiny girl.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, that little
girl with the white pajamas.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
To the left, it's a group of
children that are hypnotized

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
or in some kind of
unconscious state.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
They are seeing things,
they're enjoying themselves.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And behind that, there
is glass partition

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that is going into
a laboratory, where

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
there are being examinations
and kind of testing of genetics.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
There are mantids, and
there are also Greys there.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
On the other side, to the right
is an implantation machine

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that implants into the little
children, little implants

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:90%
into their body.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where do they put them.

00:06:23.672 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: The implants?

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: The implants are
put usually in the spine

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and around the lower
half of the body.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: The implants are
meant for a couple reasons.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
They are both using
the DNA of the human,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%
but it's also etheric.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
it's meant to monitor

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational frequency
field of a human

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
through their
evolutionary process.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So some people might think
it's more like tracking.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, we're looking
at the vibrational frequency

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of the human as they develop and
they grow throughout their life.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Every human is like a
multidimensional vortex,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're somehow
connecting through our DNA.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
How we shift what we
learn epigenetically

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
is storing information
in our memory,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
so they can access that
information very easily

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
etheric technology.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you were
five in the little picture.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
How old were you when
you painted the picture?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: This picture was
probably done maybe 2018.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:90%
2018.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I began painting
after a near-death experience,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
which allowed me
to understand very

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
deeply our human lives and
the purpose of our existence.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that I
had an insatiable feeling

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.748 align:middle line:90%
to want to paint.

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
from one day to the next,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.197 align:middle line:90%
I began painting these images.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did other people
know what had happened to you?

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Were you being monitored?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: So throughout my life,
when the film Extraordinary,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The Seeding first
came out in 2017--

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, that's
really when I became public

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:90%
with my experiences.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But before that, no, I didn't
share with anyone other

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:90%
than my family.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went
public on your own?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, in the
film, pretty much.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.948 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my family became
aware of my lifelong experiences

00:08:14.948 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's
been happening.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they knew that
there was something going on.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But yes, it was
during that time.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geraldine, tell us
about this military involvement.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
What did they want
to know from you?

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So I actually didn't
realize that it

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:90%
was military until later.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I had been taken out
of school several times

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
during my childhood to
have some kind of testing,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.433 align:middle line:84%
psychological testing,
which I thought was normal.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd be in class,
and they'd come and get

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.512 align:middle line:90%
you and take you out.

00:08:44.512 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: That's right.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
bring you back?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.158 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: They
would bring me back.

00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They would test to
see level of IQ.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They would test to
see if I was psychic.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:84%
They would test to see
if I could remote view.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And they would ask me
these strange questions.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
But I thought it was normal.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until later that I
looked back and interviewed

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
some of my classmates,
that they they'd never

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
recalled having those kinds
of tests done to them.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were the only
one they interviewed that way.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Myself and a couple
other children that were there,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you remote view?

00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes, that's right.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I remote viewed several times.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And in some of
these experiences,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I was taken by some
of these groups,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
these interdimensional groups,
to remote view very specific

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
events that were happening,
especially for the military.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the reptilians?

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing with you?

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, there's many
different kinds of reptilians.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just like humans.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a plethora of
vibrational frequencies

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and intentions.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And these beings were
very interested in using

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:90%
psychic abilities.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They were very connected
to the military, especially

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:90%
the Draco reptilian race.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So because I had those psychic
abilities already as a child,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
they would use me
inter-dimensionally

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
for that information.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And those are
agreements that we make

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
in many different lifetimes.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We agree to participate in
these kinds of activities.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Geraldine, let's
take a look at a couple more

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
of the paintings that you depict
reptilians and the military,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
we're looking at.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:10%
>>OROZCO: So this is an
experience at the age of 8,

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.053 align:middle line:10%
where I'm taking on to--

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's little
tiny you standing there

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.053 align:middle line:10%
in the white pants, right?

00:10:24.053 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:10%
>>OROZCO: That is me.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:10%
But actually, I
am undressed here.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm naked.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:10%
And I'm blindfolded and standing
in water inside of a cave.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:10%
To the left side,
where you see what

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.800 align:middle line:10%
it looks like the
opening of a cave,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:10%
that's actually a holographic
projection of what I am seeing.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:10%
And I am remote viewing for
the group of three beings that

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.623 align:middle line:10%
are there behind.

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're huge.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:10%
>>OROZCO: They are very huge.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:10%
And they are having me look at
some kind of military operation,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:10%
where they're taking these
gigantic disks of what

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:10%
we know as black goo or
programmable consciousness.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:10%
It's a very
high-level technology

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:10%
that is utilized to absorb and
move and manipulate life force,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:10%
human psychic life force.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
this black goo again.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is like--

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:90%
it's programmable consciousness.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine a very
advanced quantum computing

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
system that is connected
to our genetic information,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
it connects to the
energetic system of a human,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:90%
and it manipulates emotionally.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It can manipulate the
emotions of a human.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So they were planning
on utilizing these disks

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and putting them underneath
really heavily populated areas

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
like stadiums and things
like this, in order

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
to absorb certain kind
of emotional discharge

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
from a human.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that they were

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
doing in many different
places around the world.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that was covert.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were those
objects Dracos?

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.775 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they were?

00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: The beings?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, those
were Draconians.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever try to hurt you?

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: The experience
is not so much for hurting,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
but they would implant
technology into the body.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And the technology
that was implanted

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
into the body, the experience
itself was shocking.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't something that
was traumatizing that I was not

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:90%
able to overcome.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
It was just an understanding.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
they trying to do

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
with the five-year-old or
eight-year-old little girl?

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So primarily, it's
the use of our psychic

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual power and our
life force, essentially.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- it is something
that we contribute to

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
in many levels of our creation.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So we are
multidimensional beings.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how we use our
life force, many lifetimes that

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
are connecting to
this life here,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
we make agreements to
explore different aspects

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of this human experience.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of them, to
understand the lower realms

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of contact, of interdimensional
agreements, especially

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
these more parasitic groups
that utilize other life

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
force in order to carry
out self-serving agendas.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that little age,
did you know what was going on?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: No.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.622 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
didn't understand,

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
but it was not something
that was not familiar to me.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.288 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that I had already

00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
recognized from other
lifetimes that I have had.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And most of these memories are
kind of hidden until later time.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
When I had my
experience in 2013,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that's actually when
all of these memories

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
began to come back to me.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
began to realize

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had been experiencing
these things all my life.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
all kinds of theories,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Geraldine, about how
we as humans have

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:84%
been seeded and created
and how it happened.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
a theory that we

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
may have been originated from
three different bloodlines.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
In 2017, I was actually shown--

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I went into very deep state.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown a
map of the world.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And my question in
the hypnotherapy

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
was to understand the
hybridization program,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is the
purpose of the human soul.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
what I was shown

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the human
soul is a fractal

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of infinite consciousness,
and that we are creating

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
on many different levels.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And the human race
essentially, so

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.193 align:middle line:84%
meaning what we're
speaking, what

00:14:17.193 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking,
what we're feeling

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
is all ways that we create.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And the most dense
manner of creation

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
in the three-dimensional
plane is children.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:90%
We create life.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:90%
We're creating a soul.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The creation of a soul is the
creation of an entire universe.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It is a fractal of the
universe that is created from

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
a human's-- from two
humans that unite.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that creation
of that soul

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest powers
because we are not only

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
creating a universe, but within
that universe, connections

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to portals within the DNA,
to many other solar systems

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that are encoded in the genetic
makeup of that organism.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what that means is that
essentially, we're hybridized.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We ourselves, the
human races is actually

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:84%
ancestral descendant from many
different kinds of species.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And for many generations, the
human race in their many forms

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and levels of
consciousness, we've

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of been living in many
civilizations here on Earth.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And so since we are
a hybridized race,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I was shown that we were created
from three main bloodlines, one

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
being a reptilian,
one being Pleiadian,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and the other being
a red bloodline,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:84%
which was shown to me from
the center of the Earth.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And the center of the
Earth is essentially

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:90%
the construct of the matrix.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It creates the form through
the morphogenetic field.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
How we look as
humans is designed as

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
modeled after the
Middle Earth species.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Our level of consciousness and
the gateway into the higher

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is a combination
of these other two reptilian

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
and also Pleiadian bloodlines.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's jump ahead
where you're 15 years old now.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Another missing time event.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, at 15, I was
living in South America,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:90%
in Bolivia.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking home
from teaching English one day,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:90%
I had missing time.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken into a
dark space, where something

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
was implanted into my body.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if it was
an intravenous implantation

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
into the body, where a blue
liquid would enter my body.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in my life--

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
well, let's fast forward.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.832 align:middle line:84%
3:00 in the morning,
I wake up in my bed.

00:16:30.832 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I got there.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
My family doesn't
know how I got home.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the next day
after talking with them.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But for the first time feel
aroused for the first time.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I began to realize
that, I've had something

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
happen to me during that time.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember
is vaguely the dream

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of being inserted in
the body some kind

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:90%
of blue liquid in my body.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:90%
So I became very ill.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't sure what it was.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:90%
15 years old, I was a virgin.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:90%
My uncle was a doctor.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I consulted
with him, let him

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:90%
know what was happening to me.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's probably
just a stomach flu.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not feeling very well.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
So a couple weeks passed
by, and all of a sudden,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
I see another white
light in my dream state.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:84%
This time it's an
actual dream state.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
still sick, too?

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: I am still
sick, yes, yes.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's like nausea, as
if it was a pregnancy.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And I visit the doctor.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The doctor does an
examination to try

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:90%
to understand what's happening.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Discovers that I have
a strange scarring

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
inside of the uterine
wall that at that age,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.795 align:middle line:84%
is probably something
that somebody much older

00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
should be having, someone that
already has had children before.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, of course.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: And so they do
some testing on that and they

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
discovered that
potentially, I'm pregnant,

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
but they cannot understand
how I'm pregnant

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a virgin.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days passed
by, and I have the dream,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
where this white light
enters, touches my forehead.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know, I'm
completely fine the next day,

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
No traces of a pregnancy,
no traces of sickness,

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:90%
everything back to normal.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Completely just gone.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor doesn't
understand what happened.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
He just thinks that it's just
an anomalous kind of stress

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:90%
syndrome of some kind.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
brought us some evidence

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%
of this strange pregnancy.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're looking at.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is a sonogram
of what is happening

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:90%
inside the uterine wall.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was some
scarring that essentially is

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
showing that it's a uterus
of someone that is much,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
much older than a 16-year-old
virgin at the time.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor tried to
identify what was happening

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and could not have an
explanation that made any sense.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was very difficult.
My family was very confused.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what to make of it.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
even understand what

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
sex was at that time at all,
actually, till I was 18.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course, not.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was kind of
difficult to understand that.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But later on, with the
dream of that white light

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
coming and then everything
coming back to normal,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
the thing is, I didn't link
the dream with the missing

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
time and the medical phenomena.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I did not link the two.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand that
they were connected.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
many years later

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of having the hypnotherapy that
I understood what was happening.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
a different angle.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
On the bottom, I believe
there are little marks.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
There's little white
marks that were made

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
on the very bottom of there.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Those were the scars that they
found within the uterine wall.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 2002,
you had some angelic

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
being appear in your car,
and you became ill again.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, so I was going
through a distressing time,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and this angel approached, and
it was a very vivid experience

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the angel.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, I
became very ill again.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
angel was actually

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:84%
kind of letting me know
what was going to happen

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.308 align:middle line:90%
in the next coming months.

00:20:13.308 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
the angel tell you?

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, the
angel essentially

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:84%
told me, don't be
afraid of anything.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
alignment with what you're

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%
going to be experiencing.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand what
that meant until later.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But a couple of days later,
I have this experience,

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
where I have a dream,
where this being comes in,

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:90%
touches my belly.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I find myself pregnant

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
again and extremely ill.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And go to the doctor.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The doctor doesn't
understand what is happening.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is
pregnancy number two.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: This is
pregnancy number two.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: So the illness
was very strange.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The doctor could not identify
what was wrong with me.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They tried to understand
if there was an amoeba.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:84%
They said that was
the closest thing

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:90%
to the symptoms I was having.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I had
three months left to live.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And if I--

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Three
months left to live.

00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:90%
What did they think was wrong?

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, I
mean, first of all,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't able to eat anything.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to ingest any
kind of medicine of any kind.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I was doing
to try to regulate my system

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:90%
was not working.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
My body would just
reject everything.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor said,
you have three months

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
left to live, if
you don't recover,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
if one of these medicines
don't work on you.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, finally,
one day I had a dream

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and again, a white light comes,
touches me on my forehead.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I'm
absolutely 100% fine.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And I go back to the doctor.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.883 align:middle line:84%
And I explained, I
mean, we're trying

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what happened.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:90%
They run tests on me again.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And everything comes out clear.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
The doctor doesn't
understand how it's possible.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't understand how any
of the medications didn't work.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just 100% fine.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I came back to do
several checkups after that

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because the doctor wasn't really
believing what was happening.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
completely fine.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went from
being three months to be

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:90%
terminal to perfectly fine.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Right.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
the second pregnancy,

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:90%
was that taken, too?

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.055 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:21.855 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:22.655 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:10%
That exact night,
the exact night

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:10%
that I became completely healed,
the pregnancy was also gone.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is that
because we're not

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:10%
used to hearing about
these kinds of stories,

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:10%
we don't really link these two
kinds of experiences together.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, I'm thinking
medical problem and then

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:90%
dream as a separate thing.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, thousands of
people in my support group,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about men and
women having these kinds

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
of experiences all the time.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
This angelic experience
that you had,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
its purpose was?

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And the angel realm
is very interesting.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The angel realm is here
to interact with us,

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and there are many different
kinds of levels of consciousness

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:90%
in these angelic beings.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
I think this angel

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
was one that was trying to
guide me through the process,

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to let me know that everything
was going to be fine.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And that even though I was
giving a three-month death

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
sentence, it was something
that was meant to be.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So I understood that
much later, when

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I understood the purpose for
these hybrid children that

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:84%
were being created
through the body

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.192 align:middle line:84%
at that time of these dimensions
that were merging in my life,

00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
in my conscious life, which was
very interesting to experience.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
they needed human women

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:90%
for this hybridization program?

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, I think that
it's not so much about-- well,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
the human women are
multidimensional.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so much that they
cannot create on those levels.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But what makes the human race
so particularly incredible

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is their creative power is
merging sky and the Earth,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensionality
of a human organism

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
with many dimensional planes
that are available to them.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So when a child is born,
we're not really thinking

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%
about the child.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:90%
We create the soul.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The creation of the soul
is really what it is.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are many beings
in this realms that

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to create
with different purposes

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:90%
and different agendas.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If a human is
dormant, they're not

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
going to understand their
intention for creation.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So if a mother is
conscious, is aware,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
if we practice
things like alchemy,

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, in order to
create with pure love, the soul

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're creating has a much
larger creation potential.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a much larger soul
that will recover memory.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And the intention of
the different agendas

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is to create beings that
either can be manipulated

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
or that can be like,
god, creator beings.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I experienced
and what I discovered

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is that it's just my lucidity
that was available to me

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to remember
these experiences.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe that most
humans on this planet

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
have created life in this
way interdimensionally,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.163 align:middle line:84%
perhaps many times
in their life.

00:25:15.163 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think they're

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:90%
doing with these hybrid babies?

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Hybrids, as I
mentioned, is the soul.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's the creation
of an entire universe.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is very, very
beautiful and complex.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Only 2% of that DNA is
managing this physical vessel.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it is
actually encoding

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
memory, bioelectrical
memory, which

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is within our field,
the morphogenetic field.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And actually, these children
that are being created

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:90%
are seeded.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
They're brought back into the
incarnation cycle on Earth.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are also seeding
life on many planets.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
walk among us now?

00:25:52.305 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Absolutely.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We just don't know it.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well,
yes, but in fact, we

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
are the hybrids
that we have created

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
in many other
generations and lifetimes

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that we've lived on this
planet, as well because we

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:90%
are descendants of these races.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, we have many,
many generations of humans.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We have the ancient Mayas,
ancient civilizations,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians,
that have hold

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
ancient understanding

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
of the arts of creation.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why in ancient
Egyptians' dream

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to practice and
train lucidity in dream state

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
was so important.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can remember what
you're creating in all

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:90%
these dimensional states.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think if I talk
to my mother, she would say,

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I had you in the
hospital, Georgie,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I remember some time ago.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So would that
make me a hybrid or not?

00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Absolutely.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So our hybrid DNA, so
think of it this way.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
We have encoded
where you grow up,

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:84%
where you are born, the cultural
lineage that you descend from.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Most Indigenous cultures have
a very profound connection

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:84%
with star constellations and
races and different beings.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the Indigenous
cultures, like from the Incas

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
to the Aymaras to the Hopi
Indians, to the Egyptians,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Mayans,
all over the world,

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
every single
ancient civilization

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is deeply connected to
their star seed origins.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have that memory
encoded in our DNA.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Those stories, just like the
origin of the Book of Enoch

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and the tablets of Gilgamesh,
which all talk about our union

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:90%
with the star beings.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that has been happening

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
We also understand the
immaculate conception,

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:84%
the creation of Jesus,
as a hybridized soul.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that is depicting

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
all of these occult
arts of divine creation

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
that have been practiced
through history, but we forgot.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We completely forgot that.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The hybridization
program, people

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
are remembering it more now
so that we can bring back

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
those creation arts in order to
apply our free will in creation.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many times did
they take you aboard a craft?

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, at this time,
it's many times, George.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe over 40 or 50 times,
even up until recently.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I have very strong connection.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
are always happening.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, back around 2013,
you were taken aboard a craft

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:84%
at a very strange
time of 3:33 AM.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
What was the
significance of that?

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So the time frame
is a special time

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that our brain and we go into
the deepest states of sleep,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
but also, we are able to enter
into higher octave vibrational

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.040 align:middle line:84%
frequencies at that
time in our bodies.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And for me at that time, 3:33
was exactly the time that this

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:84%
incredible light
entered my room.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And as I approached
the window to see what

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:84%
it is, and my entire
body becomes paralyzed.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And I am being drawn from
the inside, through the wall,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
out on top of the
outside of my house.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking on board the
craft by these Greys that are

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:90%
7-foot tall.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:90%
They speak to me telepathically.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel the incredible
connection of peace, harmony.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And they tell to me
calm telepathically,

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and all of the terror
leaves my body.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:84%
These were completely
different beings than the ones

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that I had been in contact
with in those younger years.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And on board the
craft, I saw my aunt.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:90%
My aunt is in her nightgown.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they are taking
her into another room.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:10%
And before me, there are
three smaller Greys, maybe 3,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:10%
4-foot tall, that are showing
me a holographic prism

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:10%
of information, many layers.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:10%
The first of these
is alien language

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:10%
that kind of looks like a
mathematical algorithm, very

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:10%
complex concepts.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:84%
The second is essentially
the Pleiades constellation.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And we are taken
to the planet Maya.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
In the planet Maya,
they are showing

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
me two different timelines that
I had previously been Pleiadian.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me understand how
this multidimensional ancestry

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:90%
also functions.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And they also show
me essentially

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
how my Pleiadian
lineage is something

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that I connect to when I
tap into this information.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
They also show me
my hybrid children

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
once we go back into the craft.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
I met with four

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
of the children, one of which
I had a reoccurring dream

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that my mother would present her
to me as a child over and over

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.297 align:middle line:90%
I had the dream of this child.

00:30:48.297 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have given us
four incredible paintings

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
of your experience
on these crafts.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at these
and have you explain to us.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:90%
So this is a painting of myself.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be the
being sitting there

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:90%
on top of the rock.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
Pleiadian timelines

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that I was speaking
telepathically

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to the crowd of
people that are there.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
The little dots
on top of the head

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.220 align:middle line:84%
is to represent a
telepathic communication.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is tuning
in to geometric forms

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.025 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical type
of communication that

00:31:23.025 --> 00:31:23.825 align:middle line:90%
is basically--

00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you on that
other planet at this time?

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, this is the
planet Maya, in this case, Yes.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the next one.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is another timeline,
where I am one of the beings

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:90%
onto the second to the right.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an elder here,
a Pleiadian elder.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And they are just
reminding me that I

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.090 align:middle line:84%
had existed on this
planet Maya once before.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One in the middle
looks like Charlie Chaplin.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
inside of the craft.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, we can
see right through the craft.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a translucent
kind of technology.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.215 align:middle line:84%
It's like a plasma that
is completely conscious.

00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those were the three
smaller aliens you talked about.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.058 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, that's right.

00:32:11.058 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
and the prism.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And then this is one of the
hybrids manifesting into form

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
before me, that I was
just about to meet.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
To the right is a
holographic console,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:90%
very high-tech technology.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We show one more
picture here for you.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
female, young hybrids

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:90%
that I was introduced to.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.763 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that I
kept having the reoccurring

00:32:34.763 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:90%
dream of as a child.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is one of yours?

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes, that's right.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's got your eyes.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Oh, I hope so.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old do you
think she was there?

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, in the
picture, this is probably

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:90%
about eight years old.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.277 align:middle line:90%
She was very young.

00:32:51.277 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
communicate with her?

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Telepathically
or directly?

00:32:55.718 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Telepathically.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.540 align:middle line:90%
All communication is telepathic.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that I
made eye contact within,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
all of the memories of
having had contact with them

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.900 align:middle line:90%
started to flood back.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she
know who you were?

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes, she did.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.578 align:middle line:90%
They all knew who I was.

00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:90%
They all knew what I was doing.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.328 align:middle line:84%
And they all knew that it was
just a very temporary meeting

00:33:13.328 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was not sure
what was happening.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So I began to feel very
maternally connected to them.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to leave them.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they pay you
homage as their mother?

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, in
a way, in a way.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:90%
There is a biological link.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:84%
There is an imprint
that is occurring.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to
recover the memories,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I had been
meeting with them many times,

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:90%
actually, before that moment.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
This was just the
conscious time.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone through
a lot of preparation

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:84%
leading up to this moment,
meditating for a very long time

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and doing some deep healing
work, that allowed me to recall

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:90%
this memory consciously.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These beings, what
did they think of the soul?

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So when I mentioned that it's
very much like a universe,

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:84%
it's basically like creating a
vortex portal that is linking

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:90%
many universes together.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.219 align:middle line:90%
That's what humans are.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
Humans are portals that
interconnect many universes.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is encoding the
blueprint of the universe

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in a fractal form.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And this form that we take on
is just one form of many forms

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:90%
that we actually take on.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So when a soul is
created, it is linked.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:84%
It's entangled to all
the other soul fractals

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
that we are connected to.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So every time that human
has the opportunity

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
of waking up, consciousness
evolving, growing their field,

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.840 align:middle line:84%
recovering their
memory, we are affecting

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.258 align:middle line:84%
all of the fractals, our own
fractals and our children,

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:84%
the hybrid children
that are created,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the many souls that we
are creating together.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With all this constant
communication with them,

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
you've had some physical side
effects still, haven't you?

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah, well, the
strongest physical side effect

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:90%
is the psychic ability, really.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, my life
completely changed in 2013.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the veil was
completely ripped open.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I can see the entire
multidimensional body.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And this allowed me
to do healing work

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and to be of service to others.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's changed the
way I see our purpose

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:84%
on planet for humanity and
the way I understand, really,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
where we're headed
towards the future.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point did you
realize that your family had

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:90%
involvement in this?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 2017, when the
film came public, my aunt,

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.500 align:middle line:84%
actually, when she
saw the film, she

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
called me and let me
know that that very night

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that I had the experience,
she had a dream,

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that grace describing them
exactly like I had seen them.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is the aunts
you saw on the craft.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Exactly, back in 2013.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.048 align:middle line:84%
So had a dream where
they injected something

00:36:06.048 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
in the back of her neck and
they told her, don't worry,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be fine.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
4:00 in the morning,

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:90%
she wakes up with a fever, 110.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Gets rushed to the hospital.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And they do all kinds
of tests on her.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They can't understand
what's happening.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of hours,
she's back to normal again.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is the exact night
that that experience happened.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I began to
realize, essentially,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that my entire family
is having contact.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And we did hypnotherapy
on every single member

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:84%
of my family to understand
what are their connections.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:84%
What have they
been experiencing.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Including you?

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything
dramatic come out of that?

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: A lot, a lot.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but this is kind of
where my research kind of

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
catapulted because
then I began to realize

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that ET contact is
something that is basically,

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:90%
it's in our DNA.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:58.720 align:middle line:90%
We pass it down.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.940 align:middle line:84%
What we pass down
is that in our DNA,

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we are connected
to specific groups

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:84%
that we recall stronger
every lifetime.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, these different groups
like the Pleiadians, Lyrans,

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians, they're kind of
like archetypal vibrational

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And that is what we hold.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We hold the memory of those
frequencies in our body.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
We can essentially tap into
those lineages of information,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and we can recover
the information.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Past traumas, like in--

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people talk about
galactic wars, traumas

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.080 align:middle line:84%
like those kinds of collective
traumas of the races,

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.400 align:middle line:84%
but also how we are creating
on a much larger scale, how

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.647 align:middle line:84%
we learn to manifest on a
very high dimensional way.

00:37:41.647 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
are also showing how

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:90%
we function holographically.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So, well, all of this
information I'm sharing with you

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:90%
essentially is what I was shown.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I was shown the
matrix and how this is very much

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:90%
a holographic construct.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And we, as the interface
of this construct,

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
we are the ones that are
projecting our reality.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the very
core of our belief system.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
encoded in our DNA,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that we
feel on a daily basis,

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
are all participating
to the way that our body

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.100 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing this construct.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was shown to me in a
very, very detailed manner.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they explain
Adam and Eve to you,

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the
origin of humanity?

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, in
a sense, but not

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
Adam and Eve as we know it.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The concept of Adam
and Eve is really more

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
about the alchemical marriage
of the divine feminine

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and masculine, which is
what we're experiencing

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimensional plane.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, the
DNA, this physical body

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is very much more
of a projection

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:84%
from the actual DNA
that is actually

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.200 align:middle line:90%
the code of all potential life.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most important
thing to understand.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:90%
We can heal this body.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.070 align:middle line:90%
We can transform our lives.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
The construct, the
simulation, which

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
we experience psychologically,
bioelectrically, emotionally.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:84%
That's something that humans
have a tremendous amount

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of creative power
and involvement

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:90%
in affecting and creating.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is that, the human
race is evolving right now.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:90%
We are changing a lot.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you haven't been
through enough back in 2018,

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:90%
you had a near-death experience.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, in 2018, I
had a near-death experience.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I was bitten by
a scorpion when I

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:42.980 align:middle line:84%
was visiting the pyramids
in Mexico, in Teotihuacan.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And so shortly
after I was bitten,

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I
was bitten, I was

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.270 align:middle line:90%
going into anaphylactic shock.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the car.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And my poor friend was
driving hundreds miles an hour

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:90%
to get us--

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panicking.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes,
because the pyramids

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.730 align:middle line:90%
are far away from Tulum.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.300 align:middle line:90%
There's no hospital anywhere.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going into
anaphylactic shock.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I completely
passed out and left my body.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
my body in the car

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and my friend praying
and crying over me,

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:90%
noticing that I'm passing.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I'm drawn into
a light in which my ancestors,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm surrounded by my ancestors
and my great grandmother

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.867 align:middle line:84%
bringing a basket of bread, and
my father and my mother there.

00:40:27.867 --> 00:40:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to understand the
effect that my death would

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.910 align:middle line:90%
have on the family.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:90%
But essentially, I'm shown--

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm being presented
to me, the scorpion,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:90%
the very scorpion that bit me.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to do what I do in
this lifetime, in deprogramming.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I begin to read what
is the agreement

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that I had that brought me
into this kind of experience.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
begin to understand

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:90%
what led me into that moment.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had very deep feelings
about the purpose of life.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I had feelings that
maybe as creators, maybe

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
it's unnecessary to continue
in the physical form.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So this experience
allowed me to understand

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
the value of the physical
form and why we are here,

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.550 align:middle line:90%
experiencing the physical.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So there were many
interdimensional beings--

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians, Arcturians,
Lyrans that were

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:84%
in my ancestry, that also
presented themselves to me

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:19.370 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
What is vibrational
language, Geraldine?

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So vibrational language is
essentially the language

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're speaking
all the time.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:90%
We have many senses.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:84%
We have the five main
senses, but we also

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.050 align:middle line:84%
have many, many
senses that we're

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:84%
communicating
energetically, vibrationally

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
through the sound of my voice,
the words that I'm speaking,

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.380 align:middle line:90%
the thoughts that I'm thinking.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So in that way,
in this dimension,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:84%
we feel it as
vibrational frequencies

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.290 align:middle line:84%
that we pick up
through the body.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And we feel them through
the nervous system,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the bioelectrical
system, because these

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.110 align:middle line:90%
are bioelectrical charges.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So the more that we
create conductivity

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the
more that we learn

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:90%
how to become more conducive.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's by holding
higher vibrational emotions

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to the alchemy of our emotions,
which doesn't mean holding

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:90%
a high vibration emotion.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It means opening your
ability to all your emotions

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and integrating that
ability in the zero point.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
The cultivation
of the zero point

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.990 align:middle line:84%
is actually the access into this
multidimensional vibrational

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
we can communicate

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:84%
with many other species,
beings of other dimensions,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.100 align:middle line:84%
beyond just the human
spectrum of sight.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
one of your illustrations

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that shows us exactly
what you're talking about.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Explain that, Geraldine.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a depiction
of a being that is meditating,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and around them is
a light language.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:56.642 align:middle line:84%
The light language is actually
a language that I speak.

00:42:56.642 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I speak many of these
kinds of light languages.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is one language that
is transmitting information

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:84%
about how the field encodes
genetic information.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have these beings
been truthful with you

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:90%
about everything?

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: It's really not
beings that I communicate with.

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The information that
I am sharing with you,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.170 align:middle line:84%
this is information
that I have been

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.570 align:middle line:84%
kind of researching and uncover
through many experiences,

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:24.520 align:middle line:90%
many communications--

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Downloaded into you?

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yeah,
perhaps download.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But I really work with my higher
self, my highest end source.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:84%
That's really where I get
the most information from.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
basically on your own now.

00:43:36.975 --> 00:43:37.775 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:37.775 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: We are everything
and nothing at the same time.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
we are, mostly.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
still being abducted?

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yeah.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider it
ever actually abduction

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
because we are always
moving interdimensionally

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.350 align:middle line:90%
in our dream state.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just our matter
of remembering

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
what we're experiencing
in the dream state.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The more we come into order
with nature, with the Earth,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:84%
with the harmony,
that's when we can

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:84%
begin to remember and
have more free will

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.630 align:middle line:84%
in these kinds of
interdimensional experiences.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
to this kind of contact.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you miss seeing
your hybrid children?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: No.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: No, because I
believe that we are one

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and we are completely connected.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I can connect to
them at any time

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that I want to connect, to
understand what's going on.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
connect with you?

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Yes, if they wish
to connect with me, they can.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think at this
level of creation,

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.670 align:middle line:84%
you understand that
there's no attachment.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:35.920 align:middle line:90%
We are entangled.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Every single organism
on the planet

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:84%
outside interdimensionally,
we are connected as one.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to understand
and cultivate that connection,

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.840 align:middle line:84%
there's no loss, and
there's no separation.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many are there?

00:44:52.712 --> 00:44:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Well, there
are many hybrid children.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.753 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you know of?

00:44:55.753 --> 00:44:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: 24 hybrid children.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yours?

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And four--

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 24 hybrid children?

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: 24, yes.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But you see, it's not
creating children the way

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.790 align:middle line:84%
we create children
here on Earth.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
form of creation.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you'd be
pregnant every day.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Exactly.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is not in
the physical form.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.330 align:middle line:84%
This is something
interdimensional.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, we are creating
a soul, a soul, which is--

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they?

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Universes.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
everywhere, just like us,

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
many beings that

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.690 align:middle line:84%
surround us even in this
time and space right now.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an essence
of a consciousness

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:90%
that manifests in many forms.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have connections to
that through our consciousness.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
like you on this planet

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.070 align:middle line:84%
are going through the same
thing you're going through?

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OROZCO: Millions,
millions of people.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Many people.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think the conversation
about this topic

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is important because we need
to learn what creation is.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much as of becoming
pregnant and in the human way

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:90%
that we think.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding of
sex is very limited.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:84%
It's turned into a taboo, into
something scary, something

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.590 align:middle line:90%
that we shouldn't touch.

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Taboo.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OROZCO: Yes.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:10%
But in reality,
our sexual energy

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.380 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most
important primordial life

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:19.020 align:middle line:10%
forces, that is the
creation of DNA, the code.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And when that is linked
with soul essence,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that is really the
creation of universes.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff talked
about us, planets

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:90%
being very evolved souls.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So in reality,
every soul that is

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.460 align:middle line:84%
created on this planet
or other planets

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is evolving in the
same way that we

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:84%
are to eventually become
universes at some point, become

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.140 align:middle line:90%
aware of that.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
a hold of you, Geraldine?

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:90%
