>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief" with our
special guest, Adam Apollo.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
He's been a physicist, systems
architect, designer, developer,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
for nearly 20-plus
years, founding

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
several educational and
technology-oriented companies

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and organizations.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:90%
He's very involved in that.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
He has been a featured
speaker on future technology

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and unified physics at the
White House, the United

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Nations, and conferences all
around good old planet Earth.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Adam, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM APOLLO: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to be
here with you today.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a lot of
history for your young age.

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah,
you might say that.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
People were saying that
to me in my early 20s too.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's just that time.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And right now, so much
is converging so quickly,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:90%
we have to be on our game.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.522 align:middle line:90%
It's the Renaissance.

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
physics that captured

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
your imagination and attention?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: Well, I
knew from the time

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:10%
I was very young that a lot of
the things I heard in school

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:10%
were lies.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ha!

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: And I was being
told this story about reality,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:10%
a story about how we're
coming into existence,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:10%
and what these things are,
and what this body is.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt like so
much of it was not true.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I became instantly
extremely interested

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:90%
in how things actually work.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:90%
How does the mind actually work?

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that someone could

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.368 align:middle line:84%
look at you from across the
room and you feel it tingling

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:90%
on the back of your neck.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you know it.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There's no
physics explaining

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
how someone looking at
you could tingle your neck

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
or burn your ears when
they're talking about you.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.615 align:middle line:84%
So I became fascinated
with these phenomena

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to explore
them more deeply.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was
in school, and I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
used to sit behind
people in class,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I would do exactly that,
just to see if it would work.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.208 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: [LAUGHS]
Like, poke them.

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would stare at their
head to make them turn around.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Yeah.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I just did it.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, maybe
a minute later, the person

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
would just turn and
look and look back.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And I went, it works.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It does.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.068 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I didn't know how
or why, but I knew it did.

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, I used
it to kind of create

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
a little powerful pointer
finger and just poke at one

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
of my friends across
the room, especially

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to get someone's
attention if shouting

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd get frustrated
when I'd look at a girl

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and she'd never turn around.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah,
that's always rough.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this awakening
that has occurred for you,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:90%
was it an epiphany?

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Or was it something that
developed over time?

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: The initial big
click happened one afternoon.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And in that afternoon, I was
hanging out with a friend.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We were philosophizing, asking
questions about these things.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And tried doing some
different experiments.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Could you feel it if
you look at your hand,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:90%
or if I look at his hand.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it adapted to
this little experiment

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
where we put our fingers
together like this.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I very slowly
separated my fingertips,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
space between them.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I saw this stringy
fluid between my fingertips.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
it, like a vibration

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:90%
going into my fingers.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
a charge of energy.

00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:37.025 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Yeah.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And as a 15-year-old kid,
I was like, oh my god.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I found the force.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
The force is real!

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You might have.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: But a lot
of people, I think,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:90%
have that kind of experience.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I developed so
much of a scientific inquiry

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to my mind and the way
that I was exploring things

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't stop there.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I hid objects on the other side
of the room and had my friend,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
blindfolded, try to locate
them using his hand,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
or me doing it with mine.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
We tried blindfolded
martial arts.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:90%
How fast could we go?

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
explored this field--

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
pretty fast, by the way.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.683 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Thank you.

00:04:15.683 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I can go much faster.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The more I explored
this field, the more

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it explained
so many of the missing

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
pieces in my school studies,
in geology, in astrophysics,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and provided a groundwork for
a much deeper understanding

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
of how consciousness is
related to spacetime.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
science behind it?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something else?

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There is absolutely
a science behind it.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.477 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
explore that with you.

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
would scarf over it.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even think
there's a science behind it.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They would talk about it being
supernatural, or paranormal,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.172 align:middle line:90%
or not existent.

00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: That's right.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's changed a little bit
more recently, because of some

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.087 align:middle line:84%
of the Heisenberg interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is not
Heisenberg from "Breaking Bad."

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: No, this is not
Heisenberg from "Breaking Bad."

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And not a giant balloon either,
which some people confuse that.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But the interpretation of
quantum mechanics that's become

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:90%
very popular--

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:90%
which I actually disagree with.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
And I can explain that later--

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that something
is either a particle

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
or it's a wave.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know which it is.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it's going to
collapse into one or the other.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:10%
This guy Schrodinger
did this whole--

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The cat.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: --thought
experiment with the cat.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And the cat's either
alive or dead.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he makes
up this experiment

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to show that this
interpretation is ridiculous.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:90%
He thought it was crazy.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:90%
So did Einstein.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Schrodinger's cat.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And yet, we
use it all the time.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As an example.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And but
popularly, the idea

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that something only
becomes what it

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is because we put a
conscious focus on it,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
that does connect to the
metaphysics of the mind.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
That is something
that's applicable,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
which is, I think, a lot of
the reason why a lot of people

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:90%
have grasped onto that.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.543 align:middle line:84%
But there's a deeper
explanation than that.

00:06:23.543 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, there is?

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: There is.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well,
interestingly enough,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
if you have the same kind
of double slit experiment,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and instead of just
shooting beams of light,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
you fill it with a fluid, and
you have these little vibrating

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
beads that you shoot
through the fluid, well,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the beads are a particle.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
creating a wave form.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And so as the particle moves, it
makes a wave on the background.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But also this one point
does hit the wall.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if spacetime is actually
this super fluid medium

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
with vibrating
points inside of it,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, you don't
have either-or anymore.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it also works to apply
consciousness to this.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize
that consciousness

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:90%
is a wave propagator.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.973 align:middle line:84%
We are putting out beams
of waves all the time.

00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You have a project called
the Guardian Alliance.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this,
then have you explain

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more about it.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Sure.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:10%
and now the Guardian Alliance.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I was doing workshops,
traveling around the world

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
for many years, and
teaching small groups

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of people about how to
cultivate your energy, how

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to work with yourself,
face your inner challenges,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and become more aware
of all that you are,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
so that you can give your
deepest gift in this world.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
I've done here, is

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:10%
I've created a platform for
your teachings to come forward,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:10%
when you're ready.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And for those of us who
have been cultivating

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
this work for a very
long time, to share

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
some of the secrets
of reality with you

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and show you what it
means to be a guardian

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and to forge an alliance,
an alliance for this planet.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:10%
This world needs us right now.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
It's time to bring our truth.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It is time to step
forward as guardians

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, of its
people, of all the life on it.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:90%
It's time to unveil who we are.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It is time to honor what
is essential to honor.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:90%
That is life.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And that is you.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And that is your truth.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
talk about guardians,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
as you illustrated
in that clip, it's

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the
watchdog of the planet.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:90%
But what exactly do they do?

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you expect us to do?

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, it comes from
multiple perspectives on what

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:90%
guardianship actually is.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
We think about a
parent or guardian

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
being someone who
watches over a child

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and is able to make
decisions for a child who's

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
incapable of making their own
decision to protect themselves.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We also look at guardianship as
protecting something valuable,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:90%
something important.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And here we are on this amazing,
gorgeous, beautiful planet.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
The planet is undergoing
massive amounts of impact

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
from human culture
and from pollution,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:84%
from the way that we're
running our technologies.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
thinking and the minds

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
of so many of the
people on the planet,

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
we realize that because
of the American way

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.506 align:middle line:90%
or because of whatever--

00:09:52.506 --> 00:09:53.306 align:middle line:90%
this is--

00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the
Chinese way, whatever.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: The Chinese way,
whatever you want to call it.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
You've got school.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:90%
You've got work.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do this thing.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
You got to make this money.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:90%
You've got a thing.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you've
got to make enough.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.808 align:middle line:90%
And you go buy a house.

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:90%
And you-- all this.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are conditioned
into these very small

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
little streams.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And we suddenly realize we've
lost the freedom of thinking

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and choice to be able to
make decisions that are

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:90%
going to be good for everyone.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And so why do we need guardians?

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need guardians
to reflect back to people

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, you know what?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not perhaps seeing the
full impact of the choices

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.050 align:middle line:90%
that you're making.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you were willing
to look at these pieces,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to see
that this is creating harm

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:90%
or this is creating good.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And so protecting the
destiny of the human race,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
protecting the children
for generations to come,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that is the role
of the guardian.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The guardian is not there to
make decisions for anyone,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but instead to empower
the consciousness

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see the
potential future that we

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
can have in which we're
thriving, and happy,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and abundant.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can the
individual be a guardian?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Or must it be the masses?

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think every
individual has a responsibility

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to be a guardian to some extent.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Not every individual will
choose that responsibility.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we need people
who are willing to take

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that responsibility
and to stand forward

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.998 align:middle line:84%
for those future generations
and for our planet.

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:24.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a physicist.

00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I am a physicist.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
unified theory of physics?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah,
so I do this work

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
since I was a
teenager that I call

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:90%
the unified harmonic matrix.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And it emerged from
a vision in which

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.002 align:middle line:84%
I saw the interconnectedness
of everything.

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As a teenager?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.385 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: As a teenager.

00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And I started
doing deep dives into physics

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to see if
somehow there were

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
keys to this whole
unified theory that

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
was emerging from inside of me
inside of the existing physics

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And mainly, what I found was a
lot of scattered puzzle pieces

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%
that hadn't been put together.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.442 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fragmented everywhere.

00:12:05.442 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And all of the
cracks, all the fragments

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
were basically the pieces that
were missing this understanding

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of this fundamental field,
what we may call the ether,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:90%
or the vital force, prana, chi.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.168 align:middle line:84%
You go to any
mystery tradition--

00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I did as
a teenager when I first

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:90%
discovered this--

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of these different
mystery traditions

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:84%
are all talking
about this field.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it was
completely missing

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
in what I was seeing
was modern physics.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually realized
that it was actually

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.203 align:middle line:84%
cut out of physics around
the turn of the 1900s.

00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%

been included in called
"Black Hole," where

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:10%
he talks about this
theory of unified physics.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:10%
- What unifies everything
and everyone, everywhere?

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:10%
This question has baffled
physicists and scholars

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:10%
for centuries.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:10%
Nobel Prize winner
Albert Einstein

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:10%
came up with the most
respected physics equations.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:10%
But his dream of finding
the unified solution

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:10%
eluded even him.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:10%
Where should one
look for the answer

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:10%
to this universal puzzle?

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:10%
To the past?

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:10%
The future?

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:10%
The ends of the
cosmos or beyond?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:10%
Or inward?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:10%
Is the answer inside
a particle, a proton?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:10%
Does our consciousness
affect the nature of reality?

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:10%
Maybe clues have
been left for us

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:10%
throughout the
centuries encrypted

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:10%

Who among us can
unravel the mysteries?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Einstein was a technical
assistant at the patent office

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:10%
when, in his spare
time, he cranked down

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:10%
some of the most remarkable
theories, theories

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:10%
that remain the crux of
classical physics today.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Einstein once said,
any intelligent fool

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:10%
can make things bigger
and more complex.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:10%
It takes a touch of genius
and a lot of courage

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:10%
to move in the
opposite direction.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of Einstein, Adam?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There's
something about Einstein

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
that most people don't know.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
When he published his theory
on special relativity,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
it supposedly wiped out the
need for the luminiferous

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
either, this sort of
more metaphysical basis

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
for the arising
of all forces that

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.020 align:middle line:84%
was known for thousands of
years if you go into the vast.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Michelson and
Morley's experiment

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
supposedly proved
it didn't exist,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:84%
although all they had
was a tabletop laser.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to detect if you

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:84%
could feel the ether
moving through the laser

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
as it's spinning
around the Earth.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they weren't
thinking about the fact

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the ether is moving
with the surface of the Earth.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And then Einstein
supposedly disproved it.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing you know,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
he releases general relativity.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And in general relativity,
he's describing spacetime

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
as a fabric.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And as that fabric warps and
weaves, light goes with it.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was his teacher
Lorenz who came to him,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Einstein,
you know you just

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:90%
prove the ether exists, right?

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, oy, you're right.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he does this
whole paper on the ether.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And in it, he says, you cannot
have the theory of general

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:90%
relativity without an ether.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime must have fundamental
mechanical qualities.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Everybody ignored it.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Nobody publicized it.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Scientists still to this
day don't talk about it.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't accept it?

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Because somehow this
association with the ether--

00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he right?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: --associated
it with spirituality.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Spacetime is an ether.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a
fundamental fabric woven

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:90%
of what I call a light lattice.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a high tensegrity
lattice made of light.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
vacuum catastrophe?

00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: The vacuum catastrophe
is something Nassim talks

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:90%
about a lot.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a point in the mid
1900s where basically we

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
were using two
plates to see if we

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
could measure how much energy
is in completely empty space.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was that there's

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
such a gargantuanly
large amount of energy

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
there that physicists
couldn't explain it.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they had to re-normalize
all the equations.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
seem to explain much.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: No, it's true.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
To be fair, there's a lot
of really great physicists

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:10%
And when I was in
high school, the work

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:10%
of Lee Smolin on
loop quantum gravity

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:10%
helped me to gain some
traction and understanding that

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:10%
spacetime itself is a
geometric structure.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:90%
But he was missing--

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
their form of spacetime-- and
we see this a lot in magazines

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
these days--

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
this kind of wobbly,
foamy spacetime

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:90%
that's just all crazy.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is not
the way it actually looks.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's got to have some kind
of pattern or geometry.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Because everything that
we see arising around us,

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
from plants, to animals, to the
pattern of the galaxy flowing--

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
all of these things have
fundamental geometric patterns

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:90%
inside them.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The fire ratio, and
the hexagonal lattice,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
well, what would

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
make the most sense is if
everything was triangular

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and if there was a natural
balance in the triangular

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
structure of space.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking
about how space permeates.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
What would make it flat?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
What would make it curve
and make gravity happen?

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:90%
What would make it spin?

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started working
out the fundamentals

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
of how gravity and
curvature happen

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:84%
through these pentagonal
intersections.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Spacetime equilibrium happens
through a hexagonal lattice.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And spin happens through this
sort of seven pointed lattice.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And some time into
that exploration,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I came across Buckminster
Fuller's work.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And I realized--

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The geodesic dome?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: That's right.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
Bucky absolutely

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
had all these basic geometric
permutations worked out.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And he even defined
the fundamental sort

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
of force interaction
that would make sense

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to explain these
spacetime fields.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%
It's called tensegrity.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It's when something
is pushing apart

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's vibrating
and also pulling together

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he was thinking
about it architecturally.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Put this line over here
and this line over here.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And it has to have enough
of a push and pull.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And it'll stay taut.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
it in a field of energy,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
then you've got these vibrating
fields pushing themselves

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
all apart from each other
while also attracted,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
pulling together
at the same time.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with these
perfect balanced hexagonal

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and pentagonal lattices made
of equilateral triangles

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
or tetrahedrons,
as Nassim speaks

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:90%
about in a lot of his work.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, Einstein
talked about the universe

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:90%
and its curvature.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Explain to us what that means.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Where basically, if you
and I were holding a sheet,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and a third person
put a bowling ball

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of that sheet,
it would have some kind

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
of wave curvature to it.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
What does that all mean?

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, the sheet
analogy is a rough one.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
dealing with what

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
would be seen as a
two-dimensional surface.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
really get a sense

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
of how the
gravitational field is

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
moving around an object
from that perspective.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to think
about it more as

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
if you have this
curved spacetime that's

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
forming an object--
whether that's

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
a proton or many, many
protons forming a sun.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And you have all the space
time around that central node

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%
moving with it together.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.572 align:middle line:84%
So the whole field
around it is moving.

00:20:14.572 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
all the planets are

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
moving in the
spacetime field, which

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:90%
is all moving around the sun.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.528 align:middle line:84%
This also explains away dark
matter and dark energy when

00:20:23.528 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:90%
you apply it to galactic space.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it happens
around every star.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Around every star.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the entire
galaxy is a field

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.687 align:middle line:90%
that is moving in a whirlpool.

00:20:32.687 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And all of the
stars are smaller whirlpools.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But the whirlpools are not
going down, so to speak.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They're going inward towards
these toroidal structures

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
of energy, which we
call stars and planets.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they go downward,
do they create black holes?

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There
is a point where--

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
basically, what we
understand of a black hole

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a point where
light can no longer escape

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:90%
the curvature of spacetime.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:10%
But when we apply that idea to
both cosmological and quantum

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:10%
scales, what we begin
to see is that there

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:10%
is a point of infinite
curvature any time

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:10%
you follow curved
spacetime all the way

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:10%
into the center of an object.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:10%
In other words, if spacetime
is curved in a proton--

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of my
work is specifically

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:10%
on the geometry of the proton.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And I share a lot of the
geometric forces and dynamics

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
around the proton
in a course that I'm

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
releasing called quantum
geometry in the Resonance

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Academy.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I deal with
way more dynamics

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
around the proton
than have been covered

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
so far in any of the
work by Nassim or others.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about the
torsion field of the proton.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And that as you move
in towards the center,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
curvature gets tighter,
and tighter, and tighter,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and tighter, until literally,
you're dealing with a point.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the point,
you're surrounded

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
by what's called an
excavated dodecahedron.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have these 12
vector lines coming out,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.818 align:middle line:84%
which Bucky loved to
point to in his domes.

00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Those 12 spots versus the five.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he was right.

00:22:19.277 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: He was totally right.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But as you go in,
curvature becomes infinite.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And as curvature becomes
a full sphere going

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
in around an object
like a proton,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
light going into
that event horizon

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:90%
can't escape it anymore.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why I believe
Nassim is right about the fact

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that protons are black holes.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think we can
also extend that idea

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and say that the entire
universe is full of black holes.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:90%
We're probably in a black hole.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:90%
We are black holes.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
everything is made

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
of a relationship between the
sort of infinite singularities

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and these distributed
exchanges of vibration.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as we talk about
geometry, and Nassim Haramein,

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.991 align:middle line:90%
this is his explanation.

00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:05.791 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:06.591 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:10%
- In general, we could define
our society in two ways.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:10%
We've got people that have a
tendency to be very spiritual.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:10%
And these people tend
to think in terms

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:10%
of infinities, that infinite
potential and all this stuff.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And on the other hand,
we have scientific people

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:10%
that tend to think
in finite systems,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:10%
closed systems, that have
very defined boundaries.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And the two don't
necessarily agree.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:10%
And I think that at this point,
this has to come together.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And in a very simple way, I'm
going to show you geometrically

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:10%
that infinities
and finite systems

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:10%
are actually complementary.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:10%
If we take the boundary
of a circle, and we

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.590 align:middle line:10%
define that as our finite space.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, that circle
could be a sphere.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:10%
And we divide that
circle so that a triangle

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:10%
is formed in it, an equilateral
triangle, in this case.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, the universe is polarized.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:10%
Everything in the
universe seems to spin.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:10%
So spin produce polarity.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:10%
So we would have a reverse
triangle at the same time.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:10%
As soon as we do this, now
we've created a new boundary

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:10%
condition at the next fractal
level down, the next iteration

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, notice that these
new boundaries all

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:10%
are centered around a
very specific center.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:10%
That is, each of the
boundaries defines

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:10%
a very specific structure in
spacetime, a very specific

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:10%
coordinate in spacetime.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And so each of
the boundary could

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:10%
be defined as a very
specific set of information.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can continue
to divide the space

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:10%
to produce new
boundary conditions.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:10%
Now I've got another
iteration down

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:10%
and another set of information.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can continue to do
this and create new boundaries

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And at this point,
you can imagine

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:10%
that if I give this
to my computer,

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:10%
it could zoom in,
bring it back up,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:10%
continue to divide the space,
zoom in, bring it back up,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:10%
continue to divide the space.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And it could do
this to infinity.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:10%
However, I would
never, ever, ever, ever

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:10%
exceed that first boundary
I've produced for myself.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:10%
So here, I have
embedded infinite amount

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:10%
of divisions, infinite
amount of information

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:10%
within the confines
of a finite space.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:10%
So in very simple
terms here, I've

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:10%
shown to you that infinities
and finite structures

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:10%
are complementary.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:10%
That within the confines of what
appears to be a finite space

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:10%
can be embedded infinite
amount of information.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:10%
And if this is true,
this simple concept

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:10%
could change all of our
concepts of physics,

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:10%
including our concepts of our
relationship to the universe.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, give us
the Cliff Notes version

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
of what Nassim
was talking about.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, well, he's
talking about fractals.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
That basically within any
geometric boundary condition,

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:90%
you can have infinite recursion.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to
have infinite energy

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
within a limited
amount of space.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when we're dealing
with concepts like that,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:90%
it's in the mind.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:90%
This is a mental practice.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
While when we're dealing with
the structures of spacetime,

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.630 align:middle line:84%
we have sort of a different
level of dynamic going on,

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
because we're actually dealing
with energy in tensegrity

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
with itself and in
relationship with itself.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the geometry
that Nassim talks about

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and that you even have
here on the Gaia cup--

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
it's all talking about
this hexagonal lattice,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.755 align:middle line:90%
the triangles forming a hexagon.

00:27:23.755 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And the hexagonal lattice--

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.463 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seems like
a universal thing.

00:27:26.463 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It's very universal.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And even the art
crystal that I'm wearing

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:90%
is a miniature tetrahedron.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
These hexagonal lattices,
and the tetrahedral matrix,

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and the 64 tetrahedral
matrix, which

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Nassim will
talk about more,

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
are all mapping spacetime
in total equilibrium.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And that equilibrium that is
generalized to the universe

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why
electromagnetic waves, light,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
can travel across the entire
universe without restriction.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
But spacetime is not
in total equilibrium.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's rare to
find that geometry at scale.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a conflict here?

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Because--
it's not a conflict.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that in order
to fully understand

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of spacetime,
it's important to understand

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:90%
that spacetime must curve.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And in order to have curvature,
you can't just have hexagons.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it like
if you've got honeybees,

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're forming their
whole lattice of hexagons

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:90%
in their nest.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It won't bend.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all flat.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Hexagons are
designed to be flat.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Triangles and hexagons
make a flat surface.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And what you need to do in order
to get that surface to curve

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:90%
is to actually take a point out.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you take a
point out, or a PSU

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
at the spacetime level,
a Plank Spherical Unit,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:90%
as Nassim calls it--

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
the whole surface
starts to curve.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.168 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
tensegrity, a tension--

00:29:05.168 --> 00:29:06.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In all cases?

00:29:06.085 --> 00:29:07.543 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: --that
holds the surface.

00:29:07.543 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you go in
a geodesic dome,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
the only reason
that that dome is

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:84%
able to make a curve
around you is not

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:90%
because of the six triangles.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the
points where there's five.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
I realized in high school,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the five, and the
pentagram, the pentagon,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:90%
is the key to gravity.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not the six.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not the hex.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not the tetrahedron.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
understand gravity,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
the Pentagon,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.415 align:middle line:84%
because the Pentagon
creates a pole structure.

00:29:41.415 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was
in high school, I

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:90%
came across Dan Winter's work.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:10%
And Dan was talking about
how five creates implosion.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about how
a pine cone's geometry is

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the same as the pineal gland,
is the same as how energy

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:90%
moves in a spiral into a core.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was thinking
about it in terms

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of how really big energies
get to really small things

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's really interesting.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if the pentagram is
required to curve spacetime,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
then in any time you have
gravity, where-- the planet,

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:84%
your protons in your
body, a sun, a galaxy--

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have these
places where those pentagons go

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
through the structure
in order to curve it,

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to make the
curved gravitational field.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to enable
this sort of phi spiral

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
perfect weave that's
going to create

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
a pattern from everything
small to everything big.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does this happen?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Why does it happen?

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.817 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does it happen?

00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:50.963 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who conceived
of something like this?

00:30:50.963 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, well--

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This doesn't
happen by accident.

00:30:53.588 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: That's right.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
If you really get
down to it, you

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
realize that the whole
universe is extremely simple.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It's all trying to
get into balance.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.153 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:31:09.153 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: --if everything
is in balance already,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.670 align:middle line:90%
then you don't have anything.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to have things
a little bit off, a little bit

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
out of balance,
moving towards balance

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
all the dynamics,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:90%
in order to get gravity.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
have gravity, you

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:84%
have that five
spinning energy in.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Those extra points
that would make

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a six, where they
become the five,

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:90%
those have to go somewhere.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And that gives us radiation.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So where you have gravitation,
you get radiation.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Newton
understand this?

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I think Newton--

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he
saw the apple fall?

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think he got some
of the basics of the fact

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a universe
where force is playing out

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and that there's an
alchemy in those forces.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of things
about Newton's work

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:90%
are not well-publicized.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:90%
He was an alchemist.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
He was studying how the
forces of the universe

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:90%
are related to consciousness.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is where my
core work is as well.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Because I realized--

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're more
of a general expert,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.222 align:middle line:84%
not just a physicist when it
comes to things like this.

00:32:20.222 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah,
well, you could say

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm building a bridge between
metaphysics and spirituality

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and hardcore
science and physics.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a lot of scientists
would build that bridge

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: That's true.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of scientists
basically came across energy

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:90%
as a teenager.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but when
I discovered that energy

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
was flowing around me, it
changed my perspective.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that that energy
was elemental in its form.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It could be like fire,
air, earth, or water.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking up, well,
what are the four elements?

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And then what's
the fifth element?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started realizing
that for thousands of years,

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.130 align:middle line:84%
cultures around the world,
spiritual traditions,

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:84%
have used the five pointed
star, the pentagram,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to describe their
relationship with spacetime.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:90%
And yet, this geometry--

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they know
they were doing this?

00:33:24.383 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:90%
or did they stumble into it?

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: They were
absolutely using it

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
as a tool to communicate,
to call the rain,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.785 align:middle line:84%
to put out the fire,
or to build a fire.

00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work?

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.827 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It absolutely did.

00:33:36.827 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't, why would
the Celtic peoples

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.700 align:middle line:90%
use it for thousands of years?

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, where
does consciousness

00:33:42.325 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:90%
fit into all this?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Is there a science behind that?

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Absolutely.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if the same
principles that

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
enable ancient peoples to
communicate with spacetime,

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:58.850 align:middle line:84%
to make the rain come, to
engage with what we call magic

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.960 align:middle line:84%
these days, but might
be just a science

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.240 align:middle line:90%
we don't entirely understand--

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and that geometry
that they're doing

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
that with is the
same geometry as what

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
creates a gravitational
field, then

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
this tells us that there's
an inherent relationship

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:84%
between our
consciousness and how

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:84%
we relate to the universe and
the structure of the universe

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a reason
why the Star of David

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:84%
is sacred to Jewish people and
found in the walls of Egypt.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's mapping
spacetime in equilibrium.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And the other geometry
that I talk a lot about

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
is the seven-pointed
star, because we

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
find that in many spiritual
and metaphysical traditions,

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
from Christianity, to
alchemical studies,

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:90%
to the badges of state troopers.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And the seven is
related to radiation.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
related to mental process.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a mystery
teaching show on Gaia,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
of course, that deals with
consciousness in the quantum

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:10%
- People are talking about
a shift in human evolution.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:10%
What is driving this shift?

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And how do we steer it
in a positive direction?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.990 align:middle line:10%
Will it be primarily a spiritual
shift, as many in the new age

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:10%
believe?

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:10%
Will it be a purely scientific
and technological shift,

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:10%
as many transhumanists
and AI developers believe?

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:10%
Or will these two
approaches somehow

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.700 align:middle line:10%
meet and work together to
uplift the Earth to a more

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.640 align:middle line:10%
balanced and advanced future?

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:10%
The answers to these questions
truly rests in our hands.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:10%
One thing is for sure,
achieving such a balance will

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:43.760 align:middle line:10%
require a core shift in how
we think, act, and relate--

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.995 align:middle line:10%
in other words,
a paradigm shift.

00:35:45.995 --> 00:35:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, what
is a paradigm shift?

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think a paradigm
shift is anytime we have

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:84%
a belief system or structure
in which we're sharing with

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.600 align:middle line:90%
others--

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:84%
culturally, communicatively,
with our family and friends--

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's fixed in a certain way.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
This is creating a certain
paradigm of understanding.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But any belief system is
only as good as the level

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
that created it.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you couldn't
see the whole picture,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:84%
you may have come to a
certain belief about something

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and held that belief strongly.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And you might hold it
for your whole life.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is when
you build a belief system,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:90%
you stack things on top of that.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
If you believe if you
do a certain thing,

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be evil, or
you're going to be judged,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
or that this is going to
happen to you in the afterlife,

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:84%
or if you do this, then that
will happen, then what happens

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
is your actions and
your beliefs stack

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:90%
on top of that belief system.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And it gets to a point where,
if that fundamental belief

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:84%
system, that paradigm
that you're resting on

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:90%
is threatened--

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in other words, you
have new information

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.152 align:middle line:84%
that's trying to
come in to this lens

00:36:58.152 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
that you've got that's blocking
that information out-- it's

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:90%
like, I don't want to know it.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that
cracks and this opens,

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:84%
all the stack of all the
things that you believed

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:90%
are going to fall.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
find out with physics

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
how to travel faster
than the speed of light?

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Absolutely.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You really think so?

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I do.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we be able to
use it for propulsion systems?

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Yes.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.862 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what does that do?

00:37:23.862 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It'll stop time, won't it?

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Well--

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --or slow it down.

00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: If you consider the
possibility that if spacetime

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is this fundamental fabric,
this lattice of light,

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and that every way that we're
trying to move through it right

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
now is basically like a pencil
pushing through the fabric--

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:90%
we're pushing with our rockets.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:90%
You hit the gas in the car.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.910 align:middle line:84%
[GRUNTS] And you're literally
pushing against spacetime.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Warp speed.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: G-force.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what you call G-force.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's just gravity.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:90%
You're just curving space.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, if instead of curving
space and bending it

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
by accelerating, as
Einstein would say,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.880 align:middle line:84%
you just create a gap where
you create a bubble where

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:90%
you're in your own spacetime.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
in the bubble.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And you're
inside that bubble.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.430 align:middle line:84%
That bubble now
no longer is going

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to be pushing against
the surrounding space.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that bubble has the
capacity to move at any speed.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There is no actual speed
limit to the universe,

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.340 align:middle line:84%
unless you're pushing your
way through spacetime.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:84%
If you stop
accelerating or pushing,

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:90%
now there's no speed limit.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
implement that in craft?

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.548 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I believe so.

00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be amazing.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It would.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How quickly
could we get to Mars?

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Very fast.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Just like that.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:84%
You could get to Alpha
Centauri just like that.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.033 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what happens?

00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I always heard, Adam, that when
you travel like that and then

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:84%
come back, the planet may
have aged 5,000 years.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Ah, but that is all
based on warping spacetime

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:90%
from accelerating.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein showed that
if you accelerate enough

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and you warp spacetime
enough, as you're

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.910 align:middle line:84%
warping space, your
warping time, which

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:84%
means that accelerating to a
star that's 10 light years away

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and accelerating back--

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.220 align:middle line:84%
then even though
you may be going

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
almost the speed of light,
five minutes pass for you.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.110 align:middle line:84%
You get back, 20
years have passed.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Your wife is old.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a bummer.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a big bummer.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.517 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It's a big bummer.

00:39:24.517 --> 00:39:25.520 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do it.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good idea.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So instead of accelerating, if
you're not warping spacetime

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:84%
then time is consistent
across your travel.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you come
back and people are younger

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:90%
than when you left?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Ah, there are some
theoretical approaches to this.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.160 align:middle line:90%
But again, that still--

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that time dilation, both going
into the future, so to speak--

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:84%
if I go and come back and
20 years have passed--

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:84%
or going and coming back before
I left, going into the past,

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is still based on this
warp of space time.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a vehicle
that's able to move

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:84%
without acceleration and
jump through space time,

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
that effect either.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
physics that excites you?

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think that
we have the potential

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to become a species that is
responsible for our planet,

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that is in a
symbiotic relationship

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.490 align:middle line:84%
with our biosphere, and
that has the capacity

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to travel the universe
and interact with beings

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:90%
all over the galaxy.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have
the opportunity right now

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to make a transition to
becoming a galactic species

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and to developing a new kind of
relationship and understanding

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, with all life
and the rest of the universe.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And physics paves the
way for us to get there.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
pretty profound

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say
that like that.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we use that in our day to
day life to make things better?

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think cultivating
our internal physics is needed

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:90%
to make changes in our lives.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Getting to know the root
chakra and its relationship

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to the pentagram and
the sacral chakra

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship to the
hexagram Nassim was talking

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:84%
about, the solar plexus and its
relationship to the heptagram.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the geometry
of space in the way

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's processed by
our bodies is crucial.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Because this is your vehicle.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:90%
This is your spaceship.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is it.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And you're in
it until you leave it.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:32.607 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Make it work.

00:41:32.607 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: So learning how
to master our capacity

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.578 align:middle line:84%
to use our own energetic
field and develop a deeper

00:41:38.578 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
spacetime is fundamental.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, did the ancients
understand this, in some way?

00:41:42.912 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I believe that
many ancient cultures did.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had
different perspectives

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:90%
on the same fundamental truths.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you tell a
physicist of the next 20 years

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
talking about today?

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I would say,
let go of the complexities

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
of the standard model
of quantum mechanics.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It's missing so many pieces.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's gotten so convoluted
in its mathematical structures.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's keeping you from seeing
the simple truths about reality.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it faulty?

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It's very faulty.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet, no physicists,
other than people like you,

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.360 align:middle line:84%
are coming forward or have
the guts to come forward

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to say that it's faulty.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, there
are quite a few of us.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about
the structure of funding

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:84%
in the academic world,
and you look at the fact,

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:84%
also, that you have
professors and books.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
teaching the same thing

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.090 align:middle line:90%
for the past 15 or 20 years.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.283 align:middle line:84%
And they want to make
their next tenure.

00:42:44.283 --> 00:42:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And if suddenly there's
all this new physics--

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they don't
want to rock the boat.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: --and they
don't understand it, yeah,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:10%
they can't-- if they can't
publish something that meets

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:10%
the new physics, guess what?

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.270 align:middle line:10%
They lose their tenure.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:10%
Or if you're CERN, and you're
getting $10 billion a year

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:10%
to find the Higgs
boson, and someone says,

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:10%
actually, you don't
need the Higgs boson

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.287 align:middle line:10%
because spacetime
gives rise to forces--

00:43:03.287 --> 00:43:05.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But let's
keep looking for it.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: --then that's $10
billion you're going to lose.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's, I think,
momentum keeping people

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:90%
from doing those deeper dives.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: It's such
a pleasure, George.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.875 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a rebel
physicist, you know that.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.315 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I enjoy
that very much.

00:43:19.315 --> 00:43:20.115 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:20.115 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's fun
talking physics with you.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Thank you.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.012 align:middle line:84%
