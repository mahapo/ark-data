>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:10%
Debbie Solaris is with
us, a galactic historian

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:10%
and ET contactee.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
She receives downloads
of galactic information,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:10%
including star lineages,
to help heal and transform

Debbie, welcome to the program.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBBIE SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me back.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: I've been
really good, thanks.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did this
all start for you?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It started
a few years ago.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
I was actually an ET contactee.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:10%
I was actually on board an
Arcturian starship back in 2012

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:10%
and had an amazing
transformative experience

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:10%
on board the ship.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And it awakened me to, I guess,
quite a few psychic gifts

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't have before.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they find you?

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Or did you find them?

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
they found me.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I actually said a prayer
out to the universe,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:90%
asking for assistance for Earth.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I was really worried about
the state of our planet.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just decided to
send out this prayer.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And I asked for assistance from
any higher dimensional beings

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:90%
that were willing to help us.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I understood
that that was

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
the reason why they contacted
me was because of the prayer

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
I sent out.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
that contact occur?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:90%
In what form?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.345 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It occurred during--

00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I always say it
was probably more

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
of an out-of-body
experience, where

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I went to sleep as normal.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But when I came to, I was in
a different consciousness.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And it just wasn't a dream
because it was very, very real.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself on board
an extraterrestrial starship.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see the ET?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I did, yes.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they look like?

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They were larger
heads, smaller bodies.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't look
like gray aliens.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
They had the large
eyes, the larger head.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
But the eyes had pupils.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of bluish,
greenish in color.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But they had very,
very big auras.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
The auras were so
bright and so colorful

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.117 align:middle line:84%
that it was even difficult
to look at them directly.

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared at all?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No, I wasn't.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what is
star lineage, Debbie?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So ever since I
had that experience on board

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
the ship, I had--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to have activated an
extra sensory perception in me.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And through a
series of events, I

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:90%
started doing Akashic readings.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I've done thousands of
Akashic readings since 2014.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the many
Akashic readings I've found

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or I've done with
certain individuals,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I've realized that, hey,
there's quite a few of us that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
aren't originally from planet
Earth, that we have souls.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So a starseed and a star
lineage are similar in the sense

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that a starseed is somebody
that has a soul that originated

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
from another star system.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But they're having
a human incarnation.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
A star lineage is
the lineage of where

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:90%
they came from originally.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody, for
instance, is from Lyra,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:90%
they have a Lyran star lineage.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a history
of where they're from.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
the most common star lineages

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:90%
right here on planet Earth?

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Planet Earth
is actually our genetics.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Our human genetics is
actually a composite

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of many different
star races who have

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
come to visit Earth
many thousands

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years ago.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we have genetics
from various systems.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Right now there's
many of us that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
have souls that come
from other systems.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But we've chosen to be
here on Earth at this time.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But the most common ones I
see are Lyra Vega, Sirius,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
and Pleiades.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.445 align:middle line:84%
Those would be the
most three common.

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
At any point were
you scared with them?

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, not
at all because they

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
emit such a loving energy
that I felt very comfortable

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:90%
with the star people.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie,
Dr. David Jacobs,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
who's a great
ufologist, believes

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that this entire
episode of visitation

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is very nefarious, that
there's something bad about it.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't pick
that up at all?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, actually, I
had a very positive abduction

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was not
negative whatsoever.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I felt very loved, welcomed,
and very much, I would say,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:84%
at peace and at home
with these beings.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a starseed?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A
starseed is a person

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
who has a soul that
originated from another star

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
system or another galaxy or
even sometimes another universe.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But they have chosen,
for various reasons,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to have an Earth human
incarnation at this time.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Have you come across a starseed?

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I've come across
many starseeds with my work.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.703 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us on the
planet right now

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
are starseeds as
a matter of fact.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we know if we are?

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually if we have
an interest in spirituality

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
or stars or if we're really
interested in the paranormal

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
or the metaphysical realm, then
most likely we're a starseed.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
some of the type of ETs

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.627 align:middle line:90%
that have come to this planet.

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And let's go through them.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And tell us what they are--

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:90%
the Lyrans-- what about them?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Lyrans and Vegans--

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
so I categorize them
in the same group

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
because they come from
the same constellation.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are actually
two different star races.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
The Lyrans-- the White Lyrans
were more of the Caucasian,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Nordic looking type of people.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They look human types?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They looked pretty
human, maybe taller, bigger.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
But they have human features.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The Vegan people from
the Vega star system

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
were blue skinned beings
that also looked human.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Avatars.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, like the
Avatar people, exactly.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And they look very similar
maybe to the Hindu gods perhaps.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of correlations
between Ayurvedic medicine

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and the Vegan principles.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
the Pleiadians?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The
Pleiadians were actually

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
a race of beings that were
descendants of Lyran refugees

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that escaped the wars many
millions of years ago.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
There was actually
a big war that

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
broke out between the
Lyrans and the Draconians,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:90%
beings from the Draco system.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Draconians had
much better technology.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So they ended up destroying
some of the Lyran planets.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So the Lyran people
ended up having

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to escape to other star systems.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiades was
one of those systems.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades is actually in
the constellation of Taurus,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
the bull, which
is a Zodiac sign.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's also a constellation.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And so these beings
were descendants

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
of these refugees who settled
in the Pleiades asterism.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
star system Sirius

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.055 align:middle line:90%
is where the Sirians come from.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
the country of Syria.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, not
the country of Syria.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's the
Sirius star system.

00:07:38.838 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same system that
the Dogon tribe in Africa

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
talked about?

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So Sirius is a
trinary star system.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Right now I think
they're actually binary.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But at one time, there was
actually three Sirius stars.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.195 align:middle line:84%
So there's a Sirius
A, a Sirius B,

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and a Sirius C. The Dogon people
interacted with the Nommo, who

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:84%
were amphibian beings from
Sirius B. And it's actually--

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
don't realize this.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
But the plant cannabis actually
originated from Sirius B.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:90%
They brought it here?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They
brought it here, yes.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know if we
should thank them or not.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I think we should.

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows, right?

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.248 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think we
should because it's

00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
an amazing medicinal plant,
has many wonderful properties.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:90%
But it actually means--

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
so canis means dog.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:90%
So it's Latin for dog.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.515 align:middle line:84%
And bis means two, which is the
second Sirian star, which is--

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: --the Sirius
B. And so they brought it

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:90%
with them to Earth.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so now we get to
partake of cannabis.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, what
about the Andromedans?

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
What about that
sect, I would guess?

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, Andromeda is
a very interesting star system.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are very
fascinated with Andromeda.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda-- there's actually
two Andromedan locations

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that I often deal with
when I do Akashic readings.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
Andromeda galaxy,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole other galaxy.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It's actually 2 million light
years from our galaxy here.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Our system, OK.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There's also an
Andromeda constellation.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the
folks that I work with,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
when I do Akashic
readings or at least

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
from Andromeda,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
are usually from
the constellation.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But the Andromedans are actually
a composite of different races

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
of beings that--

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
there is a few that were
humanoid and quite a few that

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:90%
weren't.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.855 align:middle line:84%
Some avian beings, also
located in Andromeda.

00:09:42.855 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And there is
also quite a few humans

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
or humanoid type of
beings that were also

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
descendant of Lyran refugees.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But they had evolved so
rapidly in Andromeda because

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:90%
of its remote locations.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
the Arcturians?

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A lot
of people are also

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
very fascinated
with the Arcturians.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians are a race of
beings that are actually very,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
very high dimensional, very--

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
most part are some
of the few races

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are able
to transcend dimensions.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So they can move up and
down dimensions at will.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Not too many other
beings can do that.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
They're actually a
separate consciousness

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that, when this
galaxy was formed,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
ended up residing in the Boötes
constellation, which is where

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
the star Arcturus is located.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By knowing
your star lineage,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:90%
does it help you in your life?

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Does it help your health?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%
What does it do for you?

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That's a
lot of the work I do.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of clients who
ask me about their health

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
or ask me about
their relationships

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
or ask me about their work.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
understanding of what

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:84%
systems they previously
incarnated in

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
allows me to assist them
in finding solutions

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to some of the issues
that they might be having.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
For instance, quite a few folks
that are of Lyran heritage

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes find that
they might suffer

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
from certain
autoimmune conditions.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for this is
because the Lyran people,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
millions of years ago, went
through a tremendous war.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So they went through
a lot of trauma.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.975 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of trauma
signatures in their soul DNA.

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
handed down, I guess?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, it
just kind of carries--

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
it kind of genetically carries
what-- carries within them.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And then we do contain--

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
us here on Earth

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that have a certain percentage
of Lyran DNA from Lyrans

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.857 align:middle line:84%
who visited Earth
a long time ago.

00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:49.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:49.657 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So these
trauma signatures,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
when they undergo a stressful
period in their life,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:90%
might get reactivated.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they might
experience some sort

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.485 align:middle line:84%
of autoimmune condition, such
as fibromyalgia, for instance.

00:12:03.485 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you think Adam and
Eve were starseeds?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
they were likely--

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
this is my interpretation
of that whole story

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and that maybe a lot of
people won't agree with this.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But I actually think they were
an allegorical representation

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of what happened with the
downfall of the Lyran system.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh Yeah.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: So they--

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more
about the Lyra system.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The Lyra
system is pretty much

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the home
of human consciousness.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So that was where the
humanoid races actually began.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It was where pretty much
our physical reality

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
began in this galaxy.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So these beings are
considered to be our founder

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
races or our forefathers.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And like I said before, there
was two different races.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So there was the
Blue Vegan race that

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
pretty much carried more of the
mother goddess consciousness

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the White Lyran race

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that had more of the father
god consciousness frequency.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:90%
So these were our forefathers.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
These were beings
that pretty much

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
started the expansion
of humanoid races

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:90%
throughout our galaxy.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other issues,
medical or otherwise,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
do the Lyran suffer from?

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Sometimes they can
also suffer from migraines,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:90%
for instance--

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Migraines?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.375 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, migraines.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they get some--
they get headaches

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:90%
when they undergo stress.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The other thing they
might suffer from

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is maybe just some
immunocompromised conditions.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
would be in human beings

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:90%
from the Lyran descent?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, yes.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So I have quite a
few clients who have

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
had previous lifetimes in Lyra.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, and how
do you know that?

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Through doing their
Akashic records readings.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So I will oftentimes
do a reading.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And just looking
into the records,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll see that, oh, you had a
certain percentage of lifetimes

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:90%
in Lyra.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any
hypnotherapy involved?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Not really,
not with the method I use.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.435 align:middle line:84%
I just download the information
directly from the records.

00:14:26.435 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, what remedies
do you have to cope

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
with some of these conditions?

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
What can people do?

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of--

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Lyran starseeds, for
instance, do really

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
well with
psychospiritual healing,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
such as family constellation
work or QHHT sessions,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
which QHHT is a form of
hypnosis that allows a person

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to explore past lives--

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
so past life
regression type work.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.662 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them will also
do very well with Theta

00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
healing as well as supporting
maybe going on a cleaner diet.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So a high vibrational
diet will help them.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, for
Lyrans, they do very well

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
with very vigorous exercise.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
These are very physical people.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them
do really well when

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
they get involved with
very active sports.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you spent, Debbie,
10 minutes with somebody,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
would you know if they
were a Pleiadian, Lyran,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Arcturian whatever they may--

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Vegan?

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, I do know this.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to read
somebody's auric field.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times--
and I read frequency.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, I'll
pick up certain star lineage

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
frequencies and
somebody's auric field.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I can tell if
usually what system they're

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:90%
connected with.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you tell in my
case if I have any connection

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
at all with anything?

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.737 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, you're
definitely a starseed, George.

00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, you are.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I pick up Lyran
heritage with you

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
but also many
lifetimes in Orion.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So you've had some
lifetimes in Orion.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Pleiadian
system in terms of their health

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:90%
situation?

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Is it different?

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It is a
little different.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians are very
sensitive, empathic people.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they get affected
by environmental energy

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:90%
quite easily.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they might get
overwhelmed with this energy.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And they might need
to take a timeout.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes with Pleiadians--

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little breather, huh?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They need
a little breather.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They need maybe some
stress management at times.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
What I find with
Pleiadian starseeds

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
is there's quite a few
of them that suffer

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:90%
from pre-diabetes or diabetes.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few of them also might
contract certain cancers.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So they'll need to look
at the emotional reasons

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.039 align:middle line:84%
why they have created
these maladies that they're

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:90%
dealing with.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.063 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they more
susceptible to disease?

00:17:07.063 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I wouldn't
say any more susceptible

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:90%
than say Lyrans or Sirians.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I would
say they probably need

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.365 align:middle line:90%
to do some stress management.

00:17:16.365 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where
did their genetics

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:10%
come from, the Pleiadians?

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Mostly from Lyra.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.712 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are descendants
of Lyran refugees.

00:17:24.712 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned the Sirians.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
What is their starseed
health situation like?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Sirians
in general tend

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to be a little bit more
healthier, I would say,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:84%
generally speaking because
there's so much Sirian genetics

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So Sirian people really do
well here on Earth, more

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
so than, say, a Pleiadian
or an Arcturian.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But they can suffer from insulin
resistance, especially when

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
they're under a lot
of stress or even

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:90%
some stress-related illnesses.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And they also sometimes
can have heart conditions.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.262 align:middle line:10%
So they might need to do
things to support their heart.

00:18:07.262 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is fascinating.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a mainstream
medical doctor and say,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.702 align:middle line:84%
he's a Pleiadian or a Lyran,
they would think you're insane.

00:18:15.702 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
deal with them.

00:18:18.647 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No, no.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
But this is the direction--

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you could help them
medically by talking to them.

00:18:23.963 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
ways a starseed can improve

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
their health, mostly by just
working with their emotions,

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
working with maybe
some past life trauma,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even working
with this lifetime trauma.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
But they can also do things
to help boost vibration.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
When they do that, they find
that things shift very readily

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are these
different sects, S-E-C-T,

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
respond to certain things, like
the Sirians with plant medicine

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: It's because
of their history--

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:10%
of their galactic history.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:10%
Sirian people were very
focused on physical health.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, many of
our physical alternative health

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
modalities actually
originated from Sirius,

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:90%
including plant medicine.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So they worked with
plant medicine a lot,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
hence why cannabis
came from Sirius.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:10%
But because they work so
much with plant medicine,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.475 align:middle line:10%
they respond very readily to
supplements and plant medicine.

00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were the original
herbalists, weren't they?

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They were.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:90%
They were, totally.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And, actually, Reiki
originated from Sirius as well

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
as massage therapy.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all the
star systems out there,

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
which ones would you say are
the most predominant for us?

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say as
far as predominant genetics,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I would say we're
predominantly Sirian.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are?

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I would
say the majority of us

00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
have a certain
percentage of Sirian DNA.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But I also see quite
a few that have

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadian DNA because these
were the star races that

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
had the most direct involvement
with developing their Earth

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
human genomes, so the Sirians
especially because they

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:90%
were master geneticists.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But the Pleiadians
too also contributed

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their genetics
to the Earth human genome.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
out-of-body experience,

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.035 align:middle line:84%
Debbie, that you had originally,
do you remember the spaceship?

00:20:31.035 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I do
remember the ship, yes.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did it-- can
you describe it for us?

00:20:34.743 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It
looked very organic.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It did not look like a
ship from a sci-fi movie.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:90%
So it was very organic.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you could tell it
was some sort of a craft.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a huge amoeba
or something like that?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It was very fluid.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's the best
way I can describe it.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It was comprised of light
and plasma-like material.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.842 align:middle line:90%
And it would shift and change--

00:20:56.842 --> 00:20:57.642 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Glow.

00:20:57.642 --> 00:20:58.897 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: --and evolve--

00:20:58.897 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Morph and go back down.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:21:01.265 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But there was also
somewhat of a structure to it.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would find that when
these beings were taking me

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
on board the ship and they
were showing me around,

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
they actually showed
me different spaces

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and rooms, which
also shift and change

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
according to what the needs.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
other humans on the craft

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
when you were there?

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There was
other humanoid beings.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.385 align:middle line:84%
But I don't recall any
other Earth humans.

00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Human
beings, interesting.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The Bible talks about ancient
people, like Methuselah,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:90%
being 900 plus years old.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I find that hard to comprehend.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: This-- I
have a lot of thoughts

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%
about that actually.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about how
Earth people used to live

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:90%
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I've looked
into the records,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.290 align:middle line:84%
my understanding around
that is that, in the past,

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Earth humans used to
have 12-strand DNA.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And now we're only
down to two strands.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the other 10?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: We became manipulated
by certain star races

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
of people, such as the Anunnaki,
who wanted to manipulate Earth

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
human genetics in order
to use Earth humans as--

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Workers.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.353 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: --as workers
and slaves, totally.

00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So this totally
downgraded our abilities

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:90%
to live a long, fruitful life.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And it introduced a lot
of health conditions.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.622 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you think humans
did live 900 years old?

00:22:28.622 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah, totally.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we have that capacity
of doing that even today

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
if we can transcend
our vibration

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and also be able
to align with more

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth
dimensional energies.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine what that

00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:90%
will do to Social Security?

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.332 align:middle line:84%
We'll be on Social
Security forever.

00:22:48.332 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They will be busted.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I know, totally.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But we won't need
Social Security

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
because we will have the ability
to manifest whatever we need.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:90%
So we won't need money anymore.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some of us age
differently and others don't?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people reach
90, close to 100.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Other people are sometimes
lucky to get to be 40 or 50.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Why the difference?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say partially
because of their genetics.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.682 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have
hardier genetics.

00:23:13.682 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different starseeds?

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, maybe different
starseed lineages and maybe

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:90%
some other folks.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it can
do with epigenetics.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is the
condition where we are

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
able to change our genetics.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So some of us might live
very stressful, hard lives

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that might have an
impact on our health.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Others of us have learned to
better self-care and maybe ways

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with stress that
enables us to live longer.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you understand
anti-aging?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
How can you make yourself
appear to be younger?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I can just share
what I've done, I guess.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I've actually gone through a
complete health transformation.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:90%
I've lost almost 80 pounds.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You weighed
80 more pounds?

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I did.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did you put it?

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It was
all around here.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I was
a little apple shaped.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, I did lose 80 pounds.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a lot of my own
research around anti-aging.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have certain telomeres.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So the telomeres-- the shorter
they get, it impacts our aging.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
So we age more rapidly.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So in order to lengthen
our telomeres in our cells,

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:90%
there's two components.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is interesting.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's eating less,
taking in less calories.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And also, the
other thing is exercising

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
vigorously--

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:84%
so doing some form of
cardio and weight training.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.592 align:middle line:84%
And these are exercise
that I incorporate.

00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's common sense.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just totally common sense.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it also is working
on the emotional components

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of why you've maybe developed
these conditions to begin

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
so looking at maybe some past
life trauma or even this life

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
trauma that might be
impacting your health.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
breast cancer back in 2016.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And I decided not to
use allopathic medicine.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I went on a total
alternative medicine route.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You took a chance.

00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I took
a chance, yeah.

00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor was
very angry with me

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:90%
because I refused to do chemo.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I refused to do radiation.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to take any
of the anti-estrogen drugs.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So I used a combination of
theta healing, of past life

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
regression work, shadow
work, a lot of detoxing,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:90%
totally cut sugar from my diet.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And within 10 months, I was
in remission from my cancer.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You beat it.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And how are you now?

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I am still in
remission six years later.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good girl.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.662 align:middle line:90%
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:26:16.662 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:90%
You're doing something right.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.953 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, thank you.

00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you recommend

00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to people who want to
change their lifestyle, who

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
want to better themselves,
who want to lose 80 pounds?

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Definitely
look into more

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of a plant-based,
high vibrational diet.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
the diet that works

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:84%
best with a lot of star
lineages regardless

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:90%
of where you're from.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So most of us do very well on
plant-based diets, maybe not

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
necessarily all full
force vegan but as much

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
plant-based as possible.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Also, exercise is important.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, common sense stuff.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
and discipline.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: What's that?

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:58.983 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Discipline.

00:26:58.983 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, discipline.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just being very consistent
with what you're doing.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Self-care is like the
ultimate importance to me.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I went through a lot
of health issues.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my health
is number one.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So I spend a lot of time
on improving my health

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:90%
and working on my health.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
too is meditation

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
helps, a yoga
practice, whatever you

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
can do to connect with
the higher realms,

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
raising your vibration,
which there's many ways

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:90%
to raise your vibration.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's many, many different
ways we can improve our health.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Stress management is a big
one, dealing with anger issues.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Or dealing with--

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: --our--
grief is another one.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Grief can definitely age
a person very rapidly.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you slow
down the aging process?

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question?

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.348 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No question.

00:27:56.348 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I believe that.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different techniques?

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There's
different techniques.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say what
worked for me was

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
a combination of the
psycho-spiritual,

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and also changing my day-to-day
habits helped me a lot.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm very adamant
about exercising.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I exercise almost every day.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I do different things.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I do
four days a week.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I do what is called the Royal
Canadian Air Force exercise.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a
lot of equipment.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But you can do it in your
house as often as you want.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.892 align:middle line:84%
And they have categories
based on your age.

00:28:30.892 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they say you do
20 push-ups if you're 45.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, wow.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do 15
push-ups if you're 55.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
They weigh that.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to
do is look at my age

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and then excel with the
numbers they give you.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, that's amazing.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, at my age,
one push-up is enough.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Right.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.757 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So I want to do two--

00:28:53.757 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --that kind of thing.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah, totally.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it works.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: So with
exercise, what

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:10%
I find with different star
lineages is that Sirian people,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:10%
because they lived on
very watery planets,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:10%
they do well with
water exercise.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They do well with swimming.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And they love swimming.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
They love boating
or water skiing.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So they do very well with
those types of exercises,

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:84%
whereas Pleiadians seem to enjoy
like more gentler exercises,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.202 align:middle line:90%
like tai chi or yoga or--

00:29:28.202 --> 00:29:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Earthy things.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, more-- yeah,
a little bit more gentle,

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:90%
more of a flow.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Lyrans, on the other
hand, those folks

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
do really well with very
vigorous exercise-- so

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:84%
weight training or running or
cycling, those types of things.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Arcturian and
Andromedan starseeds

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:84%
do very well with more
self-directed exercise.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.082 align:middle line:84%
So by self-directed,
I mean exercise

00:29:56.082 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that they can do on
their own, whether it

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
be cycling or running or
something to that extent,

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Lyran
people do better

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:90%
with team-based exercises.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do all these different
kinds of civilizations

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:10%
get along with each other
throughout the universe?

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Or are there warring
factions there?

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say there's
benevolent star systems.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are part
of what we call the Galactic

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Federation, which the
Galactic Federation is

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:84%
an alliance between these
different star systems.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are we
not part of that?

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I thought
about that a lot.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because, as
far as our spiritual evolution,

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
we're just not there
yet on planet Earth.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We're warring with
each other too much.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They look at us
as a hateful civilization.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, we're too
much duality consciousness.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
agree with that.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not quite there yet.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got a ways to go.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:10%
Are there other ways that
you can raise your vibration?

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And what does that mean?

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, I would say
probably the easiest way

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:90%
would be through meditation.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
That will raise your
vibration immediately-- eating

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
a clean diet and taking
care of yourself.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So even emotional
self-care will help.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Personally, my favorite way
is just to watch a comedy show

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:90%
and laugh.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.993 align:middle line:90%
Just laughing--

00:31:21.993 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they say
laughter is the best medicine.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were totally
right about that.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's my favorite
way to raise my--

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
so if I'm feeling down one day,
I'll just watch a comedy show.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.488 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And I'll
start laughing.

00:31:35.488 --> 00:31:37.822 align:middle line:84%
And it totally changes
my perspective on things.

00:31:37.822 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie,
have you ever come

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
across a psychic vampire, a
person who just sucks energy

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
from people?

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't even
know they're doing it.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
But they are.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh,
totally, all the time--

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
all the time, as more often
than I like to say I do.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.162 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I do run
across those people.

00:31:56.162 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, do you try
to get away from them?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Or do you try to help them?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Mostly I just try
to create a shielding force.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So I create a shielding
bubble around myself.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I actually pull in energy
from the star Arcturus.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just
meditate and connect

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
with the star Arcturus and
my Arcturian star family.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And I will pull in this
swirling white and blue light

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:84%
into my crown chakra
and create a Toric field

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.740 align:middle line:90%
around my physicality.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So it just strengthens
my auric field.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And so then they don't have the
capacity of sucking energy off

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.385 align:middle line:90%
of me or anybody else.

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.135 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So I do that
quite a bit actually.

00:32:38.135 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of music

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
in its ability to make
people upbeat and happy?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Music and sound
has a really direct effect

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:90%
on shifting our frequency.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So listening to really
nice, soothing music

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:84%
can do a lot to help
shift someone's frequency.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sound of rain
or something like that.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah, totally,
or even just some nice,

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.760 align:middle line:90%
high vibrational music.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If anybody has Alexa,
do an experiment with Alexa.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Say, Alexa, please
play sounds of rain.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.138 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:33:17.138 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it is
truly remarkable.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
want it shut off,

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Alexa comes back
on and says, do you

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:90%
want to sleep by this sound?

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.530 align:middle line:90%
And you tell it yes or no.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's a soothing effect.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I always tell Alexa
to play happy music.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:90%
And she does.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
There's always some sort of
upbeat song or something.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can also use the
technology around you

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.147 align:middle line:90%
to help boost your frequency.

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
you just brought up

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
something interesting--
technology, of these various ET

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
groups that you've
mentioned on this program.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Are there any that are more
technologically advanced?

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.398 align:middle line:90%
Or are they all the same?

00:33:58.398 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would
say the Arcturians

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and the Andromedans have more
advanced healing technologies,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:84%
which I hope in the near
future that we will have privy

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:90%
to some of these technologies.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
They have healing pods that are
able to heal people just using

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
And I think these will be
probably similar to the med

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.530 align:middle line:90%
beds that are coming on the--

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're popping
all over the place now.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see them
at airports and stuff.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah, totally.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
wave of the future

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:90%
that we're moving more towards--

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
away from allopathic,
big pharma and more

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:90%
towards frequency medicine.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call this
alternative healing universal?

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, definitely.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on frequency.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a better ET group

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.147 align:middle line:90%
that is better than the other?

00:34:47.147 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
each of the different races

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:90%
have their own techniques.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.142 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like saying one
kid is better than the other.

00:34:54.142 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, you can't do that.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you love one
kid more than the other.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
you can't do that.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do that.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But they have
their different techniques.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Sirians are very
physically oriented.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of our
alternative medicine

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:84%
actually originated from
Sirius and the Vega system

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.460 align:middle line:84%
because they were kind
of a Vega-based society.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But the Arcturians were
amazing with frequency,

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
with shifting, being able to
improve health through using

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:90%
just frequency alone.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirians actually
worked a lot with crystals.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, the
Andromedans did too.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.477 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So did the Atlanteans.

00:35:35.477 --> 00:35:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: The Atlanteans, yeah.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they?

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, they
used a lot of crystals.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you are able to
work with crystal healing,

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that could help as well.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And as far as
frequency medicine,

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians were very good
at psychospiritual healing.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to help
people transcend their emotions.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
These were people that
were very empathic.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to help people
heal from trauma just using

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
a transference of emotion or
a transmutation of emotions.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Andromedans used
a lot of sound healing.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
travel to a star

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
system, which of the many that
you mentioned would that be?

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Probably Arcturus
because they just had

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:90%
amazing crystal healing pods.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.827 align:middle line:84%
I want to experience that
and see what that's like.

00:36:30.827 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I would love to
experience an Arcturian crystal

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.670 align:middle line:90%
pod.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You beat cancer.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:90%
You lost 80 pounds.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:90%
You're staying healthy.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.660 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Right
now I'm currently

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
teaching in a galactic
Akashic reading course.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:90%
We're actually on week six.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an eight-week course.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actively trying to
help others do what I do

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and have access to
their records as well

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and be able to access
this information that

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:90%
has helped me so much.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's also helped my clients.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's others-- I'm
also teaching others

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.883 align:middle line:90%
how to do what I do.

00:37:11.883 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Debbie?

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: They can find
me through my website,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:10%
debbiesolaris.com,
D-E-B-B-I-E S-O-L-A-R-I-S.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.127 align:middle line:10%
So they just find me
through my website.

00:37:22.127 --> 00:37:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they make
appointments with you?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: If somebody-- I'm
actually quite booked out

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:29.660 align:middle line:90%
right now for readings.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But if someone is
interested, they

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
can just contact me
through my website.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you say booked out,

00:37:34.513 --> 00:37:36.193 align:middle line:90%
how far out in advance?

00:37:36.193 --> 00:37:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, generally,
I just booked two months

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.382 align:middle line:90%
in advance because--

00:37:39.382 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty
intensive, isn't it?

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, but--
but, yeah, usually--

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
but I have a very,
very long waiting list.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're patient and you
want to have a reading with me,

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.630 align:middle line:84%
you just contact me
through my website.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What star
system are you from?

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
mostly from Arcturus.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But I've actually incarnated
in many different systems.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So I feel a connection
with almost all of them.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a little
bit of all of them in there.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.058 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, all of them.

00:38:05.058 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
originally from Arcturus.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your
friends say about this?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: My friends?

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They think it's-- most of my
friends are starseeds too.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So they think it's
really awesome and cool.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.070 align:middle line:90%
So they're on board with it.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
people who are skeptical?

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I've actually
encountered a few skeptics.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And pretty much
what I tell them is,

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing my thing
to help others.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And if you align with it, great.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:90%
If not, then it's not for you.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:90%
And I honor your path.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't hold a
lot of criticism

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of negative
thinking towards people

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that think differently
from me because we're all

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.770 align:middle line:90%
on our own paths.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We sure are.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Debbie, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.208 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's been great being
back and talking to you.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:38:55.743 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:10%
We're not quite in the
Galactic Federation yet.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:10%
But the day will come
that we will be invited.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And when we do, it'll
change this planet forever.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:90%
