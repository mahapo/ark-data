>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, I don't know

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
how my producers constantly
come up with incredible guests,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
but we have one now
with Laird Scranton.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
Noted author, he's
got nine books out.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:10%
His latest is "Seeking
the Primordial."

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:10%
And he's also a cosmologist,
but he calls himself

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:10%
a comparative cosmologist.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Laird, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LAIRD SCRANTON: Well,
I joke with people

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't mean that I
do people's hair and nails.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Comparative cosmology
is an attempt

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:10%
to learn more about ancient
symbols and myths and rituals

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:10%
by triangulating on how
different cultures understood

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:10%
the same elements.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in that?

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRANTON: Sort of by accident.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:10%
My wife put me on to a
book called "Unexplained"

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:10%
by Jerome Clark.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:10%
It talked about a
little tribe in Mali

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:10%
called the Dogon, a modern-day,
primitive African tribe

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
who knew some things about
astronomy they shouldn't know.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
access to telescopes.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that the
very bright star of Sirius

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
was actually two stars.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And they knew the correct
orbital period for the stars.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And they expressed it using
ancient Egyptian words.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we did not know
about the two star system

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:90%
at Sirius for years later.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: No, actually we knew
about that before that time,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
but the idea was that--
actually, Carl Sagan actually

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
suggested that perhaps
the Dogon had learned it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
from astronomers who had learned
about it around 1918 or so.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:10%
But Sagan missed the fact
that the Dogon material was

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:10%
expressed using ancient
Egyptian words that had gone out

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:10%
of use around 750 BC and
that the ancient Egyptian

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:10%
mythology-- you know, in
ancient Egyptian myths, Isis

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:10%
is the goddess who
represents the star Sirius.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Egyptians say she
has a dark sister, Nephthys.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So when the Dogon say there's
a dark star associated

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
with Sirius, we can
see the Egyptians

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.971 align:middle line:90%
knew the same material.

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was thousands
of years before that, right?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Thousands and
thousands of years before.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
Egyptians know this?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well,
that's hard to say.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon priests
flatly say they knew it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because somebody
in ancient times,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.412 align:middle line:84%
who understood the science,
told them about it.

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did they
say where they came from?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.767 align:middle line:90%
Did they point up?

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Sort of.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists also
have a similar system.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists flatly
their most sacred symbols

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.389 align:middle line:90%
came from a non-human source.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon are a
little more specific.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They say it came
from a source that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
was originally nonmaterial.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And my book, "Seeking
the Primordial"

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
sets out a path by
which we can understand

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
how that might make sense.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
That the there might have been
an intelligent consciousness

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.354 align:middle line:84%
that was originally non
material that interacted

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
with humanity in ancient times,
the way the Buddhists say,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.232 align:middle line:84%
the way the Cabbalists say,
the way the Dogons say.

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that's
an interesting take,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:90%
an intelligent consciousness.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Does that tell you that maybe
there weren't visitations,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe we were physically
told about this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials, but that
this consciousness that we

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
have tapped into somehow
fed us the information?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes and no.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
If you remember books
in the Old Testament

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.812 align:middle line:84%
where Moses is on the mountain
receiving information from God,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
the burning bush--

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The 10 commandments.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites are cautioned
not to approach too close

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to the mountain, because of
the bad effects that might

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.399 align:middle line:90%
accrue to them if they do.

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
radiation to me.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's clearly a
physical element here.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon view of things
is similar to that.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Their teachers were concerned
about potential bad effects

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
on us by being around them,
from being around them.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so their
solution to that was

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to sequester eight tribespeople
in a remote location,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
teach those eight people
and send them back to teach

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.602 align:middle line:90%
everybody else in the tribe.

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a paradigm
you see everywhere.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
You see it play out in ancient
China and in the Americas.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.527 align:middle line:90%
You see it in Polynesia.

00:04:14.527 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You see it all over
the world, really.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laird, it's safe to
say that something dramatic

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
happened a long time ago with
these ancient civilizations,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It
looks like there is.

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean beginning with this
Sirius star system knowledge

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
the Dogon had, if you
pursue it a little further

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and get down into the
anthropological material that

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
documents the Dogon
religion, the Dogon priests

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
are saying that their symbols
describe how matter forms.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.957 align:middle line:84%
And my first book was actually
a side-by-side comparison

00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
of what the Dogon
say with what people

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
like Stephen Hawking
and Brian Greene

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:90%
say about how matter forms.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's all the right
stuff, right descriptions

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.288 align:middle line:90%
and the right drawings.

00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
You could almost insert
the Dogon paragraph

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
into Stephen Hawking's
book and not change things.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
the significance

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
be of the Dogon tribe of
knowing about the binary star

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.935 align:middle line:90%
system in Sirius?

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well,
if you trace it

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to original
motives, the philosophies that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
underlie the Dogon system say
that the intention for humanity

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
there are two goals.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
One purpose is to help
humanity understand

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
its true place in relation
to the processes of creation,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
believing that that would
affect how we choose to act.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is to
foster in us something called

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
discriminating knowledge,
which is basically the ability

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
to make inferences
from a set of facts.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was
interesting to me is

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that even though the
science, from waves to Adam,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is correct that the
Dogon spell out,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
there is a more fundamental
set of processes they describe.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
You remember Albert
Einstein said

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that for what we see as material
structures to have arisen

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously, they
would have to rest

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:90%
on very simple structures.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.885 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Even Stephen
Hawking who just recently passed

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:06.432 align:middle line:84%
away, one of his final
articles said by the way,

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
the way things
happen at the bottom

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of the structures of
matter is much simpler

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
than anybody thinks that it is.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
As I was writing my book,
working from Dogon descriptions

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and comparing to half a
dozen other different ancient

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
traditions, I was
confused because it

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
looked to me like the processes
of creation are very simple.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
There are a handful of dynamics
that control what happens.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And they play out in the same
form all the way up the scale

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
from waves, or actually
from the quantum world,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.991 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to galaxies.

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you
were doing your work

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
in your books, the latest
"Seeking the Primordial,"

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
what popped up for you
that you said, oh, my gosh,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe this?

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, the entry
point piece was I thought

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to ask a question that I had--
in 20 years I hadn't thought

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to ask, no researcher I
knew had thought to ask--

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
could sacred geometry be
the geometry of a thing?

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a number
of scientific structures

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that can be expressed
geometrically.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that sacred
geometry in its simplest form

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
is the geometry of what are
called half-spin particles.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a kind of
particle of matter

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
whose symmetry requires it
to be turned around twice

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in order to look the same.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that unusual?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.099 align:middle line:84%
We should imagine that there
shouldn't be any object that we

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
can think of that had to be
turned around more than once

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.254 align:middle line:84%
to look the way it
originally looked.

00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, these particles have
to be turned around twice

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.655 align:middle line:90%
before they take--

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they look the way
they originally

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
looked when you started out.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.289 align:middle line:90%
That shouldn't happen.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't make sense
that that happens.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it does.

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So this is
the kind of particle

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that potentially passes
into a blind spot for us

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and back out of that
blind spot again.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of particle
that has the potential

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to point to a nonmaterial
realm that we don't see.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laird, physicist
Michio Kaku, of course,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
has talked about a lot
of things, including

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.632 align:middle line:90%
his thoughts on string theory.

00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHIO KAKU: And
what else could we do?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:10%
We can also unlock the
secrets of the Big Bang.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:10%
You see, Einstein's
equations break down

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:10%
at the instant of the Big Bang
and the center of a black hole.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:10%
The two most interesting
places in the universe

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:10%
are beyond our reach using
Einstein's equations.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:90%
We need a higher theory.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
string theory comes in.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
String theory takes you
before the Big Bang,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
before genesis itself.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And what does string theory say?

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:10%
It says that there is a
multiverse of universes.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:10%
Where did the Big
Bang come from?

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, Einstein's equations
give us this compelling picture

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that we are like insects on a
soap bubble, a gigantic soap

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:90%
bubble which is expanding.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are trapped
like flies on flypaper.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:90%
We can't escape the soap bubble.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
the Big Bang Theory.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
String theory says there should
be other bubbles out there.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
In a multiverse of bubbles,
when two universes collide,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
it can form another universe.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
When a universe splits in half,
it can create two universes.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And that, we think,
is the Big Bang.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang is caused either
by the collision of universes

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
or by the fissioning
of universes.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
thoughts, Laird, interesting.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.004 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: All
of that is largely

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
in keeping with
what the Dogon say,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
although spun
slightly differently.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
From the Dogon perspective,
the Dogon cosmology

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
rests on a very ancient
philosophy called Samkhya.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And Samkhya is the basis of all
the Indian traditions in India.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic tradition, the Hindu
and the Buddhist traditions

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
are traditionally understood
to rest on Samkhya.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And Samkhya says that universes
form in pairs routinely

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and that ours is the fourth
of seven pairs of universes

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that the Dogon talk
about or know about.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Now one of those is a
nonmaterial universe.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
a material universe.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's a cycle
of energy that

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
scrolls from one to the other
that is as essential to life

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
in the universe as
the natural water

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:90%
cycle is to life on the planet.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:10%
Now the natural water
cycle is water evaporating

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:10%
from bodies of water to form
clouds that then rise up

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:10%
over the mountains
and rain-- like it

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:10%
is right now today in Boulder.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And that water flows back
to the sea through streams.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Without that cycle of water,
there wouldn't be any life.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Dogon
say that there is

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:84%
a cycle of energy
between universes

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:90%
that does the same thing.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out, it's not
just energy that's growing,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
it's also mass.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein says that when
you make a thing more massive,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
you slow down its time frame.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.406 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, you're driving
your car next to a train.

00:10:58.406 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And the train is going a
little faster than you are

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
catch up with it.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a car, if you
step on the gas pedal,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
you can catch up with
the train and move

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.534 align:middle line:90%
right along side of it.

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking about
things like the speed of light,

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
When you step on
the gas, not only

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
are you increasing
your acceleration,

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
at the same time you're slowing
down how fast time runs.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the train always stays
the same speed ahead of you

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:90%
that it was.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you scroll energy from
one universe to the other,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you're changing the time
frames of these universes.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
One is becoming a
slower time frame,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
the other one is becoming a
very much quicker time frame.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that at
the middle of a cycle--

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.052 align:middle line:84%
if you think of this cycle
of scrolling energy as being

00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
a year, or the great year--
say the way the Indians refer--

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
the people in
India refer to it--

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
then the point at
which the time frame

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is equalized between
the universes

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
would be the equinox,
the point at which

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
many of the ancient
holidays were celebrated.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Egyptians referred
to the equinox as kheper.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And kheper is the dung beetle
who represents nonexistence

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:90%
coming into existence.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And in Judaism, at
the equinox, they

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
had a holiday called
Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
At the other equinox, Judaism
has a holiday called Passover.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And a Passover Seder
ends with the opening

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of a door to allow a
nonmaterial entity to walk in.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They are almost
physically enacting

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
what I say can happen
between these two universes.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
That when the time
frames equalize,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
it's like equalizing
pressure in an airlock,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes theoretically
possible for something

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
on the nonmaterial
side or less material

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
side to move over into
the material side.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
ancient civilizations

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.924 align:middle line:84%
were aware of the
possibility of multiverses?

00:12:46.924 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I think
that they absolutely

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
were, because they
were specifically

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
taught about it according to
the Buddhists and the Dogon.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And this was information that--

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't see
signs of electron microscopes

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
in ancient times--

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
this is information that
should be recognized

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:90%
by a technological culture.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.646 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: So the target
was way out in the future.

00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:09.834 align:middle line:84%
This is the future
target of information.

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the
intervening generations

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
was to try to keep it
intact to pass down

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to a generation that would
understand the references.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:90%
You come to our generation.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's all scientific.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:90%
These are scientific diagrams.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Even the Buddhists say so.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Their most essential symbols are
shapes that adhere in nature,

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
but you can only see them
with very powerful equipment.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it amazing
what kind of knowledge

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
they possessed?

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable, isn't it?

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: It is.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you want to get really
down into the motivation

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of why, why would
anybody think to do this?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Why would somebody
want to set up

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.821 align:middle line:84%
this kind of a
structure for humanity

00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:47.945 align:middle line:90%
to retain this information?

00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, as
time frames quicken

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
on the nonmaterial
side, you end up

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
at the extreme point
when it's quickest,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
you end up at a point where
all events essentially

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:90%
happen at once.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's no moment
in which to take action.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you have a
full consciousness

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that understands everything,
but has no ability to act,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
time, no moment of time

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:90%
in which to take action.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
If that were a person,
there's a syndrome

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:90%
called locked-in syndrome.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.025 align:middle line:84%
You may be familiar with
a book called "The Diving

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.025 align:middle line:90%
Bell and the Butterfly."

00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It was written by a man who
was perfectly conscious.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They thought he was brain dead,
but he was actually locked-in.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a Frenchman.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
He could only blink
his eyes, that's

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:90%
the only movement he could make.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he was aware.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Perfectly aware.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.235 align:middle line:84%
And he managed to make an
attendant aware of the fact

00:14:37.235 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
that he was still in there.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And he blinked.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
She established a system
of blink where he--

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Morse Code almost.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.618 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: One
letter at the time,

00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
he wrote an entire
book to express--

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aak.

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: --what it
was like to be locked in.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he was
trapped in this body.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So now a third of the way
into this scrolling energy

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
cycle, the less material
side figures out

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that where it's going to
end up is with it locked in,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
with no moment-- as
essentially an entangled

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
state, where there's no
moment to take an action.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's a horrific state.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
That's like being buried alive,
unless you have some compatriot

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
who knows you are there.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so their purpose was
to establish a structure

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
for a society that would
preserve our memory of the fact

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
that they're there at the
point where they're locked in.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think of a
Yuga cycle in Buddhism,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the point where one side of
the cycle is fully ascended,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
the other side is
fully descended,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
furthest removed
from any knowledge

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.502 align:middle line:84%
that the nonmaterial
even exists.

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laird, some
societies think that we're

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic universe.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The
Dogon also say that.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
The way that our
perceptions work

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
is a lot like the way Wi-FI
works, or like broadcast TV

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:90%
originally worked.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
That reality exists
in the form of waves,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
primarily because it exists
in an ultra quick time frame.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really exist here.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
The seeds of everything of
exist on the nonmaterial side.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of like the
nonmaterials of watching a TV

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
show, that our reality
only becomes real to us

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:90%
the same way that a wave--

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:84%
a broadcast television wave--
gets translated into an image

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%
if you turn your TV set on.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't turn the TV set on,
it remains as a wave that you

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
never--

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't pick it up.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't pick it up.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.426 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And
so you have no way

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
of detecting that it
exists as waves as opposed

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to the coherent
image on your TV.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's
look at the possibility

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that our universe is a hologram.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL MOYER: You and I,
and everything around us,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:10%
appear to exist in
three dimensions--

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:10%
up and down, front and
back, left to right.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:10%
But appearances
can be deceptive.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:10%
Many physicists now believe
that reality is not, in fact,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:10%
three dimensional.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Instead, they think that the
fundamental core of reality

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:10%
comes written in two
dimensional sheets

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:10%
like this piece of paper.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
In this view, our world is a
three dimensional projection

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of information that's written
on a two dimensional surface,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
an illusion much
like a hologram.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, this is insane.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:10%
What are these sheets?

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:10%
Why would anyone
think that reality

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:10%
is two dimensional
when everything we know

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:10%
appears in three dimensions?

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:10%
The answer lies in black holes.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:10%
Black holes famously suck
in everything around them

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.244 align:middle line:10%
and never let go.

00:17:20.244 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:10%
But what would
happen if you were

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:10%
to throw something with a lot of
information into a black hole?

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:10%
Something like a
book or a hard drive?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:10%
Physicists know that
information can never be lost,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:10%
only scrambled.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:10%
So the information in our
book can't disappear forever

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:10%
into the black hole
never to be recovered.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:10%
It must still exist
somewhere accessible to us.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Physicists say it is written
on the so-called event

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:10%
horizon of a black hole, the
two dimensional surface that

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:10%
defines a point of no return.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Likewise, physicists have proven
that events occurring on a two

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:10%
dimensional sheet
are interchangeable

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:10%
with the description
in three dimensions.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:10%
Mathematically,
it's all the same.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:10%
Which leaves us to
wonder which is real,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:10%
the three dimensions we
observe or the two dimensional

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.735 align:middle line:10%
description that
makes the math work?

00:18:07.735 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I must have
missed that part in physics

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.329 align:middle line:90%
in my day, Laird.

00:18:11.329 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, it's
simpler than the way

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:90%
he's explaining it.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I agree with everything he said.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
To understand it,
think about distance.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:84%
If it took me no time at all
to move from Boulder, Colorado,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to my home in Albany, New
York, then the distance

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.081 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't matter.

00:18:27.081 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:90%
If I could instantly be there.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly be there.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.983 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Then it doesn't
matter what the distance is,

00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:34.114 align:middle line:90%
distance is a moot point.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the level of waves
that he's talking about,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:84%
the two dimensional
level he's talking about,

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
distance in space has no
meaning because time is so

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
running so quickly that
everything happens instantly.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Space doesn't matter.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you impart mass
to something, to a wave,

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:90%
you slow its time frame.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you slow its
time frame, now it

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
takes you time to get
from here to there.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And now space has meaning.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:90%
It has importance, significance.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
space doesn't exist,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
it's that the
quickness of time frame

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
eliminates it as
part of the equation.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.962 align:middle line:90%
You've factored it out.

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
consider space anymore.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You can move immediately
from here to here.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.088 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you learn
how to time travel

00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:90%
if you learn the basics of this?

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The implication
is that somebody who is

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
on the nonmaterial side might
have an ability to do that that

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:90%
we don't.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The way I compare it
is we experience time

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
like a cassette
tape if we didn't

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:90%
have a fast forward button.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.804 align:middle line:84%
If we want to listen to a song
3/4 of the way into the tape,

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
our only choice is to
listen to the whole tape

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
till we get to the song.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The whole thing.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: On the
nonmaterial side,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:90%
time functions more like a CD.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
If you want to move to a
particular track, you can.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, time in ancient
Egypt, the way

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
it was described, daytime
hours were measured,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
essentially, by a
sundial, which measures

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
the motions of a shadow
measuring out seconds

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:90%
and minutes and so forth.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
At night, it was measured
by the progressive rising

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
of constellations.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Each constellation represented
the next hour of the night.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.839 align:middle line:84%
And they had 12 constellations
they tracked during the night.

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a fundamental
difference in the way

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:90%
the time is looked at.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.242 align:middle line:84%
The nighttime
measurement of time

00:20:13.242 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
compares to how
time is experienced

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:90%
on the nonmaterial side.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The sundial compares to
how time's experienced

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
on the material side.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Now there is another theory
of matter called the Aether

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
physics model.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that mean?

00:20:26.913 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: This is a
model, like string theory,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that was developed by a graduate
student in astrophysics named

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.912 align:middle line:84%
David W. Thompson III who wasn't
satisfied with the answers he

00:20:41.912 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
was getting from his professors
about fundamental questions

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.445 align:middle line:84%
like where did dimensions
come from and what--

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame him.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: What does time--

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we get down to
these fundamental questions

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.861 align:middle line:84%
and he felt he was basically
getting phony baloney answers--

00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The run around.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:90%
To these things.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So he developed this
model of physics,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
redeveloping all the
definitions from the ground up.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather than defining everything
in terms of large structures,

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
he defined everything
in terms of the smallest

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
measurable structure.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we evolved
was a system that

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
begins with the same fundamental
symbolic shapes and concepts

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that the Dogon have.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they're a perfect match
for what the Dogon are saying

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:90%
is going on.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And from his perspective,
time, as a generic thing,

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
is in oscillation,
actually everything is.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what a dipole is?

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamental
dynamic of magnetism.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea of energies
that oscillate out and then in

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and then out and then in
and then out and then in.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the fundamental
dynamics of the universe that's

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
everything is based on.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Galaxy groups are dipoles.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Gravity functions like a dipole.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And without gravity,
we have nothing, do we?

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Now, gravity
itself, as it turns out,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
the physicists are looking for
a particle to convey gravity.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you follow
what the Dogons say,

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
you come to understand
gravity as being

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:90%
like buoyancy in water.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.005 align:middle line:84%
In water, if you
have a buoyant object

00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and you take it to a
bottom of a swimming pool

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
where the pressure
is very strong--

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
the deeper you go in water,
the greater the pressure gets--

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that buoyant object gravitates
toward the least amount

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
of pressure.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fast.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: In
the universe, mass

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:90%
causes time frame to slow down.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And things that are
affected by gravity

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
gravitate towards the
slowest time frame.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the larger a planet you
have, the more massive it is,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
a massive star has a slower
time frame than a smaller.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
What it means to us
is, first of all,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in terms of religion
that religion has

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:90%
been conducted on two levels--

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
a public level and a private
level, esoteric and exoteric,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:90%
exoteric and esoteric.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
In the exoteric
religions, they tell us

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
that the processes of creation
are fundamentally unknowable,

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can't know them
no matter how hard we try.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.319 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe that?

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:08.901 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I was
confused about that,

00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
because as I was
researching this book

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.579 align:middle line:84%
it looked to me more
and more as if they

00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:90%
were completely knowable.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a handful
of dynamics here

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that are very straight forward
that we can easily understand.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Answered
scientifically or religiously?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Scientifically
and religiously.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Answer it scientifically and
then support it religiously.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
You go to esoteric Buddhism,
and esoteric Buddhism

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, by the way, one
of the things we fib about

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is that these things
are unknowable.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
perfectly knowable.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.432 align:middle line:90%
The Dogon, you can see--

00:23:37.432 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
they have a tendency
also, they admit that they

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:90%
fib about certain things.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
They have a
celebration of Sirius.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The orbital period of the
Sirius stars is 50 years.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And they have a celebration
that occurs every 50

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.637 align:middle line:90%
years of the Sirius stars.

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they know this?

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: But to
disguise that calculation,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
they say publicly that they
celebrate it every 60 years.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
The anthropologists who studied
them said, that's not true.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 50 years, they
find a reason to make an excuse

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate it
early this time.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why do they
even want to celebrate it?

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Because the dynamic
between these two Sirius

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
stars is another of the
fundamental dynamics

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the same dynamic as what
we call virtual particles.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
When two streams of
energy come together

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that are of different qualities,
even of water, when they meet,

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:90%
they tend to circle.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And they tend to spiral.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:90%
They create a vortex.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And when energy
spirals, it creates--

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
an when electromagnetism
spirals-- it creates mass.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So all that's going
on under the covers

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is that you have two
qualities of energy.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:90%
One is magnetism.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:90%
One is electricity.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they come together,
they tend to spiral.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
When they spiral,
they create mass.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they create mass,
that spiraling mass has

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of
the black holes

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:84%
we were just looking
at in your clip.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Black holes and fundamental
particles work the same way.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at,
say, an act of perception

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of a wave that draws it
up and creates a particle,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
if you were to look at that from
the perspective of the wave,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
what I suspect you'd
see is exactly what

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
we see when we look
at a black hole.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the same dynamic.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon are saying because
these processes are parallel,

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
if you understand one of
the processes in some frame

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you can see, you can
understand the ones

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:84%
you can't see just by guessing
because you know it's parallel.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
this tribe talk

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in such incredible
language of science?

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: They say because
the teachers they had,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
the teachers that taught
them, understood it.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
it as theory.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
They weren't talking like the
theorists are talking here,

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.657 align:middle line:90%
we think such and such.

00:25:49.657 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
They were saying,
here's how it works.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:90%
We understand it.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Remember it.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Teach it to your kids.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget it.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what these
ancient religions

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:90%
did, to one extent or another.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:90%
The Dogon did it very well.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.577 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhists did it very well.

00:26:03.577 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other traditions
didn't do it quite as well.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they lost it?

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.221 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Well, they lost it.

00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they played telephone with
it, so certain things changed.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon prioritize
preserving original forms,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
original meanings of words,
original meanings of symbols.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So the Buddhists also in
their own way do that also.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So by comparing back and
forth between these cultures,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
you can demonstrate that the
Dogon meaning hasn't changed,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.705 align:middle line:84%
because these other
cultures understand

00:26:30.705 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:90%
it the same way they do.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the basis for
religion in a scientific way?

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: This is the
original foundation upon which

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:90%
modern religion came out of.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.525 align:middle line:84%
In the original form,
nothing was deified.

00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
We were only talking
about stages and processes

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, because
of certain kinds of metaphors

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.212 align:middle line:84%
they were using,
they found it easy--

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to explain
something to a future audience,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to frame it in a way
they're going to understand.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the metaphors are
in terms of the animal kingdom.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And some are in terms
of the plant kingdom.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And some are in terms of
elements-- water, fire, wind,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and earth, things like that.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
In the original form, these
were scientific concepts.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Over time, they got
to be personified.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So by Egypt, you have
a cosmological concept

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that in the form of a person
with an animal's head.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And animal symbolism
actually came first in India.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are Yuga cycles?

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: OK.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Yuga-- oh, another nice
thing about this system

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is that it's based on
phonetics that have meaning.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:90%
The phonetics are root concepts.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:90%
U is the concept of--

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:84%
for the Dogon, it
represents the concept

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
of a seed that's
shaped like this.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamental
shape, geometric shape,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of matter that causes
mass to be shaped.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Ga is a phonetic value
that refers to temporality,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:90%
time past, present, and future.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so Yuga cycle is
the geometry of matter

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:90%
that shapes time.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the shaping, the
swirling energy, and at

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:84%
the same time shaping
the time frames.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our dear friend Gregg
Braden has his excuses, too,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN:
Researchers have been

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:10%
able to find is that
the Hindu cycles,

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:10%
they were, in fact, talking
about massive lengths of time,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:10%
430,000 year cycles,
for example, and cycles

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:10%
within cycles.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.216 align:middle line:84%
And they would relate
those cosmic cycles to us

00:28:33.216 --> 00:28:34.590 align:middle line:84%
through what are
called fractals.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:10%
So we are fractals of those
larger cycles of time.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting because,
from the Hindu perspective,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:10%
we entered into a 5,000 year
cycle about 3200 years BC.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:10%
And so in their way, they also
allow for the same 5,000 year

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:10%
cycle that the
Mayans talk about.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So we have a lot of evidence.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:10%
Egypt, the Egyptian zodiac,
was the first circular zodiac

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:10%
known to document
the 26,000 year

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.945 align:middle line:10%
cycle of Earth's progression
through all the zodiac signs.

00:29:12.945 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:10%
But one of the
interesting things

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:10%
is that in the
original zodiac, there

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:10%
were 13 zodiac signs, not 12.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:10%
And the 13th zodiac
sign was the sign

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:10%
of wisdom, the
serpent, which has been

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:10%
demonized in a lot of the West.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:10%
And the serpent of
wisdom is something

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:10%
you find almost universally
through these ancient and

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:10%
indigenous traditions where
the wisdom is honored.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And it was only in what we
would call modern times,

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:10%
largely during the time after
the church, for example, when

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:10%
we went to the 30-day, month
based on interest cycles that

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:10%
were introduced during
that time by the church,

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:10%
rather than the 28-day
cycles of nature that link us

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:10%
to the lunar cycles, that are
reflected in the woman's body,

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:10%
And they knew this.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.270 align:middle line:10%
So they understood the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:10%
They understood our
relationship to the stars,

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.950 align:middle line:10%
and to the cycles
that bring change

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:10%
to the earth and
their relationship

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:10%
to the stars in
ways that we only

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:10%
confirmed in the 20th century.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So is he saying, Laird?

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:10%
What is saying?

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRANTON: He's saying the
same thing that the patricians I

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:10%
study say approximately--

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:10%
that there's a 20, roughly
25,000, 26,000 year cycle,

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:10%
of which we're concerned
about really the half cycles.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And during those half
cycles, one universe

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
is becoming less massive.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It's ascending,
according to the way

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:90%
the Buddhists talk about it.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
The other side is becoming
more massive or more material.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It's descending, according
to the Buddhists.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.151 align:middle line:84%
Now, the middle of that
12,000 year half cycle

00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
is where the equinox
would have been

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
when it would have been possible
to crossover between one

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:90%
universe to the other.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:84%
That falls around
3200 or 3400 BC.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:84%
That's about the time the
Hebrew calendar starts counting.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:84%
From the Cabbalist
point of view,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.701 align:middle line:84%
there is a 6,000
year period of time

00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
there they're talking
about trying to reconcile.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now at the end
of that approximately 6,000 year

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew year
right now is 5778,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I think, coming into 5779.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's approximately
6,000 years.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So the sources I work with
are seeing that we're just

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
now passing the
bottom of that cycle

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and starting back up an
ascending cycle, theoretically,

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
things start getting
better for us.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Soon, I hope.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Though, as
John Lennon would say,

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:90%
can't get no worse.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you wrote the book
"Seeking the "Primordial, what

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.045 align:middle line:84%
was the main message you
wanted to give all of us?

00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: This
is material that

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
belongs to humanity the
same way a seed does.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If I find a seed on the sidewalk
and pick it up and plant it

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
in the ground and then
water it and care for it,

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.143 align:middle line:84%
my expectation should be that
it will grow into a plant.

00:32:13.143 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would hope.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: No one has the
right to own that seed.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
If I find the seed,
it's my human right

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to plant
it and have it grow.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
This material that
we're talking about

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
falls in that same
category for me.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.140 align:middle line:84%
This is material that
belongs to everyone.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:84%
To try to make it proprietary
goes against the nature

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:90%
of the material itself.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
This is fundamental
information that

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:84%
tells us with very
great specificity

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:84%
what our relationship is to that
larger processes of creation

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and what our role in
the cycle happens to be.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We're-- essentially, the
esoteric tradition has been

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to evoke a group of
sincere initiates who are

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
attuned to things that are
nonmaterial who can serve

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
as caretakers for the
nonmaterial side when

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:90%
it's in its locked-in condition.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:84%
As the cycle continues
around and we start up

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:19.092 align:middle line:84%
the ascending side, where we
become less and less material,

00:33:19.092 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
we are eventually
going to find ourselves

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:90%
in that locked-in condition.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.773 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to need
the nonmaterial side

00:33:23.773 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to be our caretakers.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the book
"Seeking the Primordial"

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
is to set out what
that dynamic is.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:84%
What Judaism would
call it a covenant

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.370 align:middle line:90%
is between the two universes.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:84%
That as siblings, each universe
takes care of the other

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:90%
when it needs it.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And so each, in its
own way, is doing that

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.960 align:middle line:90%
according to this cycle.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we lost
knowledge from the past?

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Because most people would
not understand this today.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It's been
preserved substantially intact

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:90%
in some traditions.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Many traditions have
lost the trail of it.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We have lost sight of
long-term goals, I would say.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.594 align:middle line:90%
If you set out on a road trip.

00:34:10.594 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
And you knew you were trying
to get from here to Florida.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And halfway through,
you lost your maps

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:84%
and got hit on and forgot
where you were trying to go,

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you could end up in New
England instead of Florida.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of where many of
the cultures we are living among

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.989 align:middle line:84%
They have forgotten where it
was they were trying to get to.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:32.440 align:middle line:84%
This book ties back
together half a dozen

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
different ancient perspectives
on where it was we

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
were trying to get to
in the first place.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it trying
to tell us, Laird,

00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that there were
extraterrestrials,

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:84%
other universes, that
there's a crossover?

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to convince us of?

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Ultimately,
the final stage

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of ascension in Buddhism
is understanding

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that it's all one consciousness,
that individual consciousness

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
represents subdivisions
of a grand consciousness,

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
not deified, simply a
life form, in the same way

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that a particle represents a
subdivision of a grand wavelike

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.860 align:middle line:84%
The processes of consciousness
that we experience

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.270 align:middle line:84%
between the two
hemispheres of our brain,

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
it's the same dynamic as
the processes that occur

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.354 align:middle line:90%
between these two universes.

00:35:18.354 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
it on one level,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:84%
you understand it on
the next level up.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And at the top level, these
14 pairs of universes,

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:84%
the seven pairs of universes,
are configured as a helix.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
The suggestion is
that the structure,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
a DNA-like structure, is
built right into the system

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.810 align:middle line:90%
from the very start.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
The potential for life is there
right from the very start.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Under the right
conditions, it's going

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.010 align:middle line:90%
to take root wherever it can.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
tell us about God?

00:35:45.985 --> 00:35:46.943 align:middle line:90%
Is it leading us there?

00:35:46.943 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It
doesn't define God.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The Samkhya philosophy is
a non-theistic philosophy.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
From its perspective,
it says all

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.910 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with at the
very start are two energies.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't try to address
where those energies came from.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But that everything
else that happens

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is a direct and
quick consequence

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of the dynamics of
these two energies.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And even the word deity refers,
in the original traditions,

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
refers only to structures in
this process that don't change.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially this
geometric overlap

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
between universes is the
structure that constantly

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:90%
remains the same.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing that
represents deity.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:84%
The original word was
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] and that

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.396 align:middle line:84%
connects to the idea of
data, if you want to go back

00:36:33.396 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:84%
to a projected universe
kind of concept.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.044 align:middle line:84%
This is the structure
that doesn't change.

00:36:39.044 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying
to treat it as a god.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying to
treat it as a deity.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.455 align:middle line:90%
This is a scientific concept.

00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through this
process, Laird, what have you

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
learned personally
about all this

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.010 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't know before?

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.385 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well,
the first thing

00:36:52.385 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:84%
a person in my field
of study learns

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
is that there are things going
on that we don't understand.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And the best way
for me to express

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that is imagine you are learning
to drive a car and nobody

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
told you that there was
a blind spot created

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:90%
by the mirrors in your car.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.898 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: You
might theoretically

00:37:08.898 --> 00:37:10.835 align:middle line:84%
drive your entire career
without an accident

00:37:10.835 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and never understand
that there's

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:90%
a blind spot in those mirrors.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or, you get
into many accidents.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.353 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Or you might, right.

00:37:16.353 --> 00:37:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the universe
is the same way.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And sacred geometry points us
to the existence of a blind spot

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.290 align:middle line:90%
that science doesn't see.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Science is only trying to
consider real the things

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:90%
that it can directly measure.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
aspects to this that are

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:90%
less than perfectly measurable.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, when I understood
that the Dogon correctly

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:84%
described waves to the
atom had to take that

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
as a credential that was
the rationale for believing

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that the more fundamental
structure was going

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:90%
to be a correct structure.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you astounded by
what the Dogon tribe knows?

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I've been constantly
astounded all the way along

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that I would even
stumble onto any of this.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's much
more than just

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.375 align:middle line:84%
them knowing about
another star system.

00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:00.174 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Much, much more.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.360 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the entry
points into the system.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The entry points
are all things that

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:84%
would make the average person
scratch their head and say,

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
gee, I wonder why
anybody would do that.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Good
example is circumcision.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Circumcision is another entry
point, symbolic entry point,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
into this system.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like a crop circle.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to make some
percentage of the populace

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.990 align:middle line:84%
scratch their head and
say, why in the world,

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.280 align:middle line:90%
how could that possibly be?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Where it could have come from?

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
What could it
possibly represent?

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And asking that question
leads you into the things

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:90%
that I'm researching.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why the Dogon tribe?

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.389 align:middle line:90%
Why them?

00:38:39.389 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: They happen to be--

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a round of
instruction at 10,000 BC

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:90%
in the era of Gobekli Tepe.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Turkey.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.614 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRANTON: In Turkey, yes.

00:38:48.614 --> 00:38:50.682 align:middle line:84%
And it looks as
if the Dogon were

00:38:50.682 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the groups
that did the best

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.300 align:middle line:84%
job of preserving that over the
course of, maybe, 6,000 years.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:10%
And so in a second
round of instruction

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:10%
that happened-- looks to me
it happened on Orkney island

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.360 align:middle line:10%
in Scotland around
3,200 BC, it looks

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:10%
as if the Dogon were
enlisted as teacher's aides

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:10%
or as adjunct professors to
be the face of the education

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.550 align:middle line:10%
and put distance between the
nonmaterial energies that

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.152 align:middle line:10%
were dangerous and the students
who might be affected by them.

00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laird, I still have--
and I've had many physicists

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:84%
on my radio show
"Coast to Coast,"

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
a difficult time trying to
comprehend the Big Bang.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I have not had one physicist--
even Michio Kaku's been

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.620 align:middle line:90%
on the program--

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.940 align:middle line:84%
who could clearly explain to
me what the heck happened.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The Dogon
say that what preceded

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the Big Bang was essentially
two black holes that

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.239 align:middle line:84%
were feeding mass
into a central space

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and that the gravitational
influence of the black holes

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.520 align:middle line:84%
held it in stasis in that space
between the two black holes.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And the matter started to spin
faster and faster and faster

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:90%
and faster.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it
grew large enough

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was spinning fast
enough that it couldn't

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
be contained anymore by
the gravitational pull

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.530 align:middle line:90%
of a black hole.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
created our universe.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:90%
That's their take on it.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's their take.

00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Dynamically, what's
happening with the Big Bang is

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.917 align:middle line:84%
the dipole dynamic of time
frames, of time frames,

00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
getting quicker and quicker
and quicker and slower

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and slower and slower.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.312 align:middle line:84%
You know, astronomers today
look through their telescopes.

00:40:28.312 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And they look back out
into the universe, which

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:90%
is like looking back into time.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're astounded.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:90%
They're puzzled.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:84%
They say based on
our calculations,

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the speed at which the universe
is expanding is increasing.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.019 align:middle line:84%
It's getting faster
and faster and faster.

00:40:43.019 --> 00:40:44.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they're seeing.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
What they're seeing is
our own time frame's

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
slowing down because
our universe is

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:90%
becoming more massive.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pope Francis had his
own views on the Big Bang.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.630 align:middle line:90%
We got to see this.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Pope Francis
has said the Big Bang

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:84%
theory is compatible with
the Catholic church's

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:90%
teaching on creation.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:10%
Speaking to members of the
Pontifical Academy of Science,

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:10%
the Pope said it is possible
to believe in both, insisting

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.080 align:middle line:10%
God was responsible
for the Big Bang

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.821 align:middle line:10%
from which all life evolved.

00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:20.320 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE FRANCIS:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:54.222 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.222 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: The
Pope's remarks were

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.170 align:middle line:10%
in line with the Catholic
church's teaching

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:10%
over the last few decades.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.491 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was he
saying in Italian?

00:42:05.491 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I would
have to guess at that.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I have enough Spanish to
be able to guess at it.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But he was, essentially, saying
what the narrator had told us

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
that the processes of
science are not incompatible

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:84%
with his understanding
of the processes

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:90%
according to religion.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting for me is
I said that the Dogon, I felt,

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.420 align:middle line:84%
had been used as adjunct
professors on Orkney island

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:90%
during that era of instruction.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.590 align:middle line:84%
There were clerics documented as
being on Orkney the early years

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:38.660 align:middle line:84%
of Orkney who were called
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And they have direct connections
to later papal traditions

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:90%
in Catholicism.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me that
it's quite possible

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that both traditions come out
of the same original philosophy.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This pope
more than the others

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:84%
seems to be more ingrained
in science with religion.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Have you picked that up?

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: There are a lot of
reasons why I like this pope.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But not just the Pope, but also
people like the Dalai Lama,

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
are also very integrated
with the perspective

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about and
are more or less at liberty

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to express that publicly.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama is in
a much better position

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.090 align:middle line:84%
to say, look, I'm looking at
things basically scientifically

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
rationality behind this.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Many people who have looked
at traditions in India

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.060 align:middle line:90%
feel that they seem scientific.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon are the ones who can
express that in modern terms

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:90%
that we understand.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Apply this,
Laird, to people watching

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
be "Beyond Belief" right
now who are saying, OK,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
this is difficult to understand,
but I'm learning a little bit

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:90%
more about this.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:90%
How does this affect them?

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're before
a class of students

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
telling them the things we've
been talking about tonight,

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.956 align:middle line:84%
and their big concern
is where are they

00:43:57.956 --> 00:43:59.331 align:middle line:84%
to going to make
a dollar or what

00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
are they going to do in their
job, how does this affect them?

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well,
certainly anyone

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:84%
with a spark of
intelligence to them

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
understands the
value in knowing what

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the true relationship is between
humanity and larger processes.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Modern society has
tended to see humanity

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.120 align:middle line:84%
as being the ultimate
culmination of all

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:90%
the processes of progress.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.990 align:middle line:84%
My friend John
Anthony West railed

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.696 align:middle line:84%
against the school of progress,
the church of progress.

00:44:30.696 --> 00:44:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.879 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:35.420 align:middle line:84%
He would be the
first one to tell you

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that what looks like progress to
us hasn't really been progress.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think the average listener
or the average student who

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:84%
wants to think about
subjects deeper

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:84%
than what was on television
last night necessarily

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:52.170 align:middle line:84%
or what was on the
sports channel last night

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.070 align:middle line:84%
understands that there's
value in seeing the bigger

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.330 align:middle line:90%
picture here.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what the
bigger picture here is

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
gives you the ability to frame
your actions and your choices

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of something that's
a constant, not something

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.772 align:middle line:84%
that's in motion, not
something that's nebulous.

00:45:10.772 --> 00:45:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people are feeling

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a lack of roots, a lack of
rootedness or anchoredness

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.664 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:45:16.664 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Why should I behave
a certain way?

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Why should I make this
choice over that choice?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:84%
What's the reason to
look out for a person?

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know rather than
take advantage of them,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:84%
If we want to reverse those
kinds of trends in society,

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.189 align:middle line:84%
it can only help to see the big
picture of where we're really--

00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.730 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years
ago we were really

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.241 align:middle line:84%
trying to head in
the first place.

00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We seem to have
been more advanced then

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.845 align:middle line:90%
than we are today.

00:45:39.845 --> 00:45:41.030 align:middle line:90%
That's my impression.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: A good example
is written language.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyone would tell you
that written language

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:90%
is an advancement.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But the Dogon don't
see it that way.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Socrates
didn't see it that way.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm currently working
on a book that

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:84%
opens with a quote from
Socrates where he is--

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.780 align:middle line:84%
he minces no words about what a
terrible thing written language

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.580 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.430 align:middle line:84%
this is a system
of reminders, this

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:90%
is not a system of knowledge.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a system
that allows a person

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to represent that they
understand the subject when

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.662 align:middle line:90%
they don't really understand it.

00:46:12.662 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
That you want to
be learning things

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.270 align:middle line:84%
from somebody who has
mastered a subject,

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:84%
not from somebody who has
read some snippets about it

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.380 align:middle line:90%
in some written document.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon look the same
way, look down their noses

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:90%
the same way on it.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.080 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just that
they didn't adopt a written

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.380 align:middle line:84%
language, that they see written
language as the first step

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in the devolution of society.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dogon tribe
is still around.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Dogon
tribe is still around.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of knowledge do

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:90%
you think they possess today?

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.845 align:middle line:84%
Because they've carried
this through pretty good,

00:46:39.845 --> 00:46:40.645 align:middle line:90%
haven't they?

00:46:40.645 --> 00:46:41.445 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Yes.

00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The anthropological
studies I'm working from

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:90%
were wrapped up around 1956.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.860 align:middle line:10%
I imagine the Dogon
priests have done

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:10%
a very good job of preserving
that knowledge since then.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is
that they're forbidden

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:10%
to talk about it to outsiders
until they have confidence

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:10%
that the outsider really is
sincere and knowledgeable

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:10%
themselves.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a 20
year process to try

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to gain the confidence
of a Dogon priest.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they trust us?

00:47:07.556 --> 00:47:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: They trusted
the French anthropologist.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They ended up initiating
Marcel Griaule

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.439 align:middle line:84%
and gave him a Dogon burial
when he died in 1956.

00:47:15.439 --> 00:47:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a Dogon burial?

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.188 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: This
is they buried him

00:47:18.188 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:84%
as if he were a Dogon citizen,
gave him a Dogon funeral,

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.875 align:middle line:84%
and gave him the honors they
would give to a Dogon priest

00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:26.750 align:middle line:90%
when they buried him.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a chance
to meet with these people

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:33.752 align:middle line:84%
right now, this tribe,
what would you ask them?

00:47:33.752 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I would be
looking for confirmation

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that I've understood the
tradition in the same way they

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I would like to know--

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of value to
me in different nuances

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.360 align:middle line:84%
of opinion about certain
symbols and certain myths.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.747 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested
in the original myths.

00:47:51.747 --> 00:47:53.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the projects I have
thought about taking on

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:57.370 align:middle line:84%
was trying to reformulate
some of those original myths.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I have enough of an
overview of certain topics

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take
a stab at rewriting

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the myth of the birth of
Ganesha or things like that.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
conclude if you did that?

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: It would
be a way of reframing

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
some of this
important information

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would
encourage it to survive.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Although, if we really are in
the ascending cycle right now,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.010 align:middle line:84%
the game is different
than it was before.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:84%
In the descending cycle,
when we were becoming

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.260 align:middle line:84%
more and more
material, the game was

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to try to preserve knowledge
that was deteriorating.

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:84%
On the material side,
the aim is to try

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to act on knowledge
that's going to become

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:90%
more and more obvious to us.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the
reason why it's OK for me

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to talk about things that
were kept secret for thousands

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years, is we're now

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.640 align:middle line:84%
entering an era
where we're supposed

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about this.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be hiding it.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kicked
that into high gear?

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What created it?

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The
natural end of a cycle.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.700 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example of how
the cycle functions, midway

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.040 align:middle line:84%
through the cycle, you see
reversals and symbolism

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.360 align:middle line:90%
happen across cultures.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Like you've seen matriarchy
turn into patriarchy.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Or you might be aware
that in some cultures,

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.852 align:middle line:84%
a circle means one
thing some times

00:49:08.852 --> 00:49:11.341 align:middle line:84%
and a square means
another thing.

00:49:11.341 --> 00:49:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And then those meanings
reverse themselves

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.710 align:middle line:90%
after a period of time.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, these reversals
in symbolism

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.509 align:middle line:84%
happen across the
board with cultures

00:49:18.509 --> 00:49:20.800 align:middle line:84%
all around the world, cultures
that shouldn't have been

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.390 align:middle line:90%
in contact with each other.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.980 align:middle line:90%
How could that happen?

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.470 align:middle line:84%
My answer to that is
imagine that you're

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
on a cross-country flight with a
group of people you don't know.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.690 align:middle line:90%
You're a passenger on a plane.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, chances are you don't know
anybody else on the flight.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.344 align:middle line:84%
You may talk to one or
two people, but that's it.

00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by the time you all
get to the end of the flight,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.850 align:middle line:84%
you all know to change
your watch by three hours.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not because anybody
communicated anything

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.580 align:middle line:90%
to anybody.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's because you all
understand the way time works.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's given knowledge.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And
this Yuga cycle is

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.792 align:middle line:90%
that same kind of a time frame.

00:49:52.792 --> 00:49:54.166 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that are

00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:55.570 align:middle line:90%
going to occur in certain eras.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
it because they

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:84%
were instructed in the tradition
thousands of years ago.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't you
baffled, though,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that they knew this
thousands of years ago?

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's amazing
when you think of it.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.894 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I would
be except that they

00:50:05.894 --> 00:50:08.635 align:middle line:84%
say they got it from somebody
who absolutely understood it.

00:50:08.635 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
that somebody be?

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Well, for the Dogon,
that's a nonmaterial entity

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:90%
that chose for its own--

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.110 align:middle line:84%
for the reasons I was
trying to lay out--

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.824 align:middle line:90%
to step across and help us.

00:50:19.824 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
you think that was?

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.089 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness by itself?

00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: The Dogon refer to
them as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.088 align:middle line:84%
Or, in the Egyptian language,
that's [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:50:28.088 --> 00:50:28.960 align:middle line:90%
waves perceived.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
This is nonmaterial
consciousness

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that chose to take
a material form

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.260 align:middle line:90%
to act in a material frame.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So not ETs that
came down and taught them?

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: There is a
connection for me to ETs.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The ET phenomenon,
very often, plays out

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the same kind
of cross-universality,

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:90%
cross-dimensionality.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.905 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you read John
Mack, who was a psychiatrist--

00:50:51.905 --> 00:50:52.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:50:52.705 --> 00:50:54.640 align:middle line:90%
He's passed on, too.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: And
Budd Hopkins was--

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.337 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's another one.

00:50:58.337 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: In the case
studies that they present,

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.290 align:middle line:84%
there are certain effects
that were reported

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:04.040 align:middle line:84%
again and again and
again by people who've

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:84%
had no contact with each other,
who claimed to have seen UFOs.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, these effects
play out in terms

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:84%
of a kind of
interdimensional translation

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.250 align:middle line:90%
that automatically happens.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The way to explain
it to you is if you

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.030 align:middle line:84%
shine white light
into a crystal,

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.820 align:middle line:84%
you can produce a
rainbow of colors.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:25.810 align:middle line:84%
That trans-- how can I
say that-- translation

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:28.690 align:middle line:84%
from white light to
multiple colors of light

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is an automatic
thing that happens

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:84%
at the boundary between
these universes.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing
happens with actions

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and concepts and words.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a UFO
encounter where a woman saw

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.170 align:middle line:90%
three gray aliens on her porch.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.810 align:middle line:84%
She stepped out onto her
porch and saw these aliens

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:47.890 align:middle line:90%
with their backs to her.

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know she
was there at first.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they noticed
that she's there.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And they turned
to quickly leave.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But instead, of seeing
three gray aliens leave,

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.690 align:middle line:90%
she sees three deer leave.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:01.169 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she hallucinating?

00:52:01.169 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: I noticed that
the Egyptian word that

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.600 align:middle line:84%
means to depart in haste is
also the Egyptian word that

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.070 align:middle line:90%
means deer.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:90%
These are homonyms.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Cosmological
terms play out

00:52:12.285 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:90%
in terms of clustered meanings.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.332 align:middle line:84%
A single concept produces a
cluster of related meanings.

00:52:17.332 --> 00:52:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But these actions
are the same way.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:22.030 align:middle line:84%
That when a UFO
rises up, a person

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:84%
who witnesses it is going to
see it being a particular color.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:84%
When it moves away
from them, they're

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:27.670 align:middle line:84%
going to see it being
a particular color.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Say a gray alien
tries to comfort you,

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.340 align:middle line:84%
you might very well see that,
interpret that as an owl,

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.990 align:middle line:84%
because in Egyptian, one of
the Egyptian cluster words--

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people have seen owls.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.661 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: --for
comforting a person

00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:41.530 align:middle line:84%
is the same word as
the word for owl.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:44.226 align:middle line:84%
It's like a
paranormal-- how can I

00:52:44.226 --> 00:52:47.280 align:middle line:84%
say it-- telepathic
translation that's happening.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
An action's being
taken, and we're

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
seeing a mirror
image action that's

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.240 align:middle line:90%
a translated version of that.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.698 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
going to really get

00:52:53.698 --> 00:52:55.690 align:middle line:90%
the answers that we're seeking?

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean are you at a point
where you can say you've

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.117 align:middle line:90%
learned what you need to learn?

00:53:00.117 --> 00:53:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: I always think that.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.944 align:middle line:84%
When I finish a book, I always
think I'm at the end of it.

00:53:03.944 --> 00:53:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And then something happens--

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another
new book comes out.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: --and I
discover that there's

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.946 align:middle line:90%
another level to this stuff.

00:53:08.946 --> 00:53:11.676 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon compare it to
skins on on an onion.

00:53:11.676 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You pull a skin
back on an onion.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one there
waiting to be peeled back.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And you never get to
the bottom of them.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, eventually, we're
going to understand this.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.110 align:middle line:84%
My role is the same as
the role of a crop circle.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:26.290 align:middle line:84%
My role is to get some tiny
percentage of the people who

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:84%
hear about my books to
scratch their head and say,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.945 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should look into this.

00:53:31.945 --> 00:53:34.529 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they would simply
say I didn't know this before.

00:53:34.529 --> 00:53:35.328 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:53:35.328 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:90%
They might simply say that.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But just to simply be
conscious of the fact

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that there's a blind
spot is a benefit.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there multiverses?

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: According to
the Dogon and the Buddhists,

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:45.290 align:middle line:90%
there absolutely are.

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are telling us that,
at least in our locality,

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.050 align:middle line:84%
there are 14 universes
that emerge as pairs.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Just as some biologists say
that all pregnancies have

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:58.990 align:middle line:84%
the potential to be
twins originally,

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:middle line:90%
universes form in pairs.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
bother you the most,

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Laird, about what you know?

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.254 align:middle line:84%
Is there something there
that's puzzling for you?

00:54:08.254 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: First
of all, there is

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:12.962 align:middle line:84%
nothing I have stumbled across
that is in any way nefarious.

00:54:12.962 --> 00:54:14.045 align:middle line:90%
It's all well intentioned.

00:54:14.045 --> 00:54:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Best intentioned.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unlike what David
Jacobs would be saying.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:84%
That in my experience-- and
I understand that different

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.831 align:middle line:84%
people experience things
in different ways--

00:54:23.831 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective, there
is nothing to be afraid of.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.440 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
to be upset about.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.190 align:middle line:84%
There's not even
concepts of good and evil

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:90%
in the Dogon tradition.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.287 align:middle line:90%
It's framed as truth and error.

00:54:34.287 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You can make an attempt
at understanding something

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:37.820 align:middle line:90%
and not succeed.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't
succeeded, all that means

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:90%
is that you need to try again.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's no good and
bad assigned to things.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's no concept of
heaven and hell, no sense of--

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:84%
there's not even a
sense of reincarnation,

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.110 align:middle line:90%
except as comes from genetics.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:54.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a god?

00:54:54.465 --> 00:54:55.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: No--

00:54:55.265 --> 00:54:56.704 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oooooooh.

00:54:56.704 --> 00:54:57.504 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:54:57.504 --> 00:54:58.962 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: According
to the Dogon,

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:90%
this is a nontheistic system.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that even the
one character they

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.080 align:middle line:84%
have who is framed
as a creator god,

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.120 align:middle line:84%
you can tell from
the phonetics, it's

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.270 align:middle line:90%
really a scientific concept.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not framed.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.290 align:middle line:84%
There is what the
Cabbalists refer to

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and the Dogon refer to as
a primordial consciousness,

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:21.880 align:middle line:90%
or a primordial entity.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.980 align:middle line:90%
But they don't deify it.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hence you book
"Seeking the Primordial."

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And that they don't deify it.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.120 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, when you understand
that that consciousness is

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:84%
the same consciousness
as yours, you've

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:39.510 align:middle line:84%
arrived at the
peak of ascension.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this something that
we should be concerned about?

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: No,
I don't think so.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:84%
To me, any person
religious or scientific,

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.090 align:middle line:84%
understands there are
two possibilities here.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Either things were set
in motion by a deity--

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it was not.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.151 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Or is wasn't.

00:55:56.151 --> 00:55:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But even if it was set
in motion by the deity,

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that still leaves
the question of what

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.790 align:middle line:90%
set the deity in motion.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can say, well,
the deity always was.

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But I can also say,
well, electromagnetism

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.819 align:middle line:90%
and electricity always were.

00:56:07.819 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
started something.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRANTON: Right.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:10%
In Samkhya's view,
a consciousness

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:10%
is capable of perceiving
itself, that you

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:20.250 align:middle line:10%
don't need to postulate a
deity to take an action.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.960 align:middle line:84%
When a thing achieves
consciousness,

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.291 align:middle line:90%
it can take its own action.

00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laird, thanks
for being on the program.

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRANTON: Thank you, George,
I appreciate it myself.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am
still amazed at how

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.180 align:middle line:84%
an ancient tribe like the
Dogons would understand

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.230 align:middle line:84%
that there was a binary star
system with their star Sirius.

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:90%
They knew this.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.360 align:middle line:84%
As you heard Laird Scranton
say Carl Sagan said,

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.810 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe they heard
these from other astronomers

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.440 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:52.050 align:middle line:10%
I think the knowledge that they
got and possess to this day

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:55.840 align:middle line:10%
came from some other source
outside of this world.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
