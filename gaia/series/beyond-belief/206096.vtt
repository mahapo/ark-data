don't know if we do.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
who you're asking.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
rule that out.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I do not rule
anything out anymore

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: It looks like a UFO.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It's very
suspiciously alien-ish.

Corin Grillo, the author
of "The Angel Experiment"

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:10%
and the founder of the
Angel Alchemy Academy,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:10%
is a trained psychotherapist,
angel channeler, healer,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:10%
and a teacher.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Corin has helped
thousands of people

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
all over this planet to
go from angel curious

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:90%
to angel empowerment.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
good gift, Corin.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I'm digging it.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.092 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
all happen for you?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
How did this evolve where
you got involved in angels?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, well
it happened abruptly.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:10%
It was nothing that
I was looking for.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:10%
I was not raised a
religious person,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and really kind of snubbed all
things religion for many years.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you're spiritual.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, I
surely am now, yes.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, OK.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.453 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: So what I
didn't realize back then

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
was that being religious
wasn't a requirement

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:90%
to get divine support, so yeah.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
When the angels entered
into my life, it was abrupt.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I witnessed a miracle,
and that miracle

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was the first of many
miracles that I've experienced

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:90%
over the last 10 years.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ask for the
miracle, or did it just happen?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I did not
ask for the miracle.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.622 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
tell us what it was?

00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I
mean, long story short,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a really
rough period in my life.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I was on my way to
a client's house,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing community
mental health back then,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
driving down the street.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And a few days prior I had had
an angel healing done for me,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what that was, but she

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
said when I left the session
to talk to the angels

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
as if they're real,
and that's what I did.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started talking
to the angels,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and I started feeling
better, feeling lighter.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was extraordinarily
depressed at the time,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and within days my depression
started dissolving the more

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:90%
that I talked to the angels.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But the actual miracle was when
I was driving down the road,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and a bird fell from the sky,
landed in front of my car.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I slowly drove around it and I
saw that the bird had a mangled

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:90%
wing.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, and I was
like, OK, this is not really

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:90%
what I had in mind today.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the
angels-- because I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
had been talking to the
angels for like three days

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and asking them for
help-- so I decided

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
to do my new trick, which is ask
the angels for help, so I asked

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
the angels to come and take
this bird out of its suffering.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And as I drove around
the bird and I continued

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:10%
to look and pray for it, I saw
the bird, with my own eyeballs,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:10%
transform from that bird
that was about pigeon size,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:10%
into three tiny
birds, and fly away.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.522 align:middle line:84%
So I saw one pop up out of
the body of the bird fly away.

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They saved the bird.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.022 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: A second and a third.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They transformed a bird into
three healthy, flying birds,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and that was when I
realized this is no joke.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Angels are real,
and that was just

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of this incredible
journey of discovering

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the reality of spirit,
and the divine, and life,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and how easily available this
kind of divine intervention

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is for anyone, for anybody.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a journey you
have never looked back at now.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps going forward
for you, doesn't it?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It is like a constant
evolution of awesome, yes.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your last episode
with us is still being

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:90%
talked about by our viewers.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:90%
You did a great job.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
touches people's nerves

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.665 align:middle line:90%
when you talk about angels?

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I think my sense is
that it's the same thing that

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
touched me when I was--

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that period, that miracle that I
just witnessed, I felt so alone

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and like I didn't
have any purpose.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And so many people out
there feel that same thing.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They are going through
the motions in life,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like the
reality of angels

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
is so important, especially
right here on the planet.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
We are designed for
this kind of support.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know it.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know it.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
the truth of love.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the love that people
sense behind the words that

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:84%
makes it believable and real,
and I-- personally George,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I am shocked that
people believe me.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: I know.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's not
to believe, right?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.745 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, that's the thing
is like, people can sense when

00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
someone's being
authentic and real,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and when someone's
just making stuff up.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It took me years to
talk about this miracle,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and it took me
years to acknowledge

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that I was having this radical
experience with the reality

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
of angels because I was a
psychotherapist at the time.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So but love is love, and that is
the medicine that we all need,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and I had not had that medicine
until the angels came that day.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's since that
day we have, and all of us

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
have the capacity to
follow the trail of love

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to the trail of hurt.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you follow
your intuition a lot?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yes, and
that is something that

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:90%
occurred after that incident.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.477 align:middle line:84%
It was like my spiritual
gifts and my intuition--

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It woke up.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --my healing
abilities, yeah.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like this whole
new world woke up

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear a new voice
inside of me that for once

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.737 align:middle line:90%
wasn't trying to tear me down.

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It was actually trying
to lift me up and get

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
me to do really
interesting, weird things

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
like learn more about angels.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I talked
with Jeffrey Mishlove,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
who is into all of
this in a big, big way.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about why some
people have better intuition

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
than others and what the
difference is with people.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.673 align:middle line:10%
Why are some people better
at intuition than others?

00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:
Well, sometimes it's

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:10%
just sort of beaten out of you.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:10%
If you're a young
boy, you probably

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:10%
remember this yourself,
big boys don't cry.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not supposed to.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, you
know, don't be in touch

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
with your inner feelings.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think I get more
emotional the older I get,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:90%
by the way, Jeffrey.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.508 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, sure.

00:06:43.508 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It's because we allow ourselves
to get in touch a little more

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
with the inner child,
which you could

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.685 align:middle line:90%
say that's the intuitive part.

00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, though,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
do not act on their intuition,
and something happens to them

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:90%
and they go, oh, I knew it?

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Doesn't
that happen often?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah,
yeah, our culture

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:90%
is heavily out of balance.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:90%
We emphasize the sensational.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:90%
We emphasize the intellect.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We emphasize emotions,
but intuition

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
is the least emphasized
of our human talents.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As I started
off with that, Corin,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
how many people don't
act on their intuition?

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:90%
They feel it.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
They know it, but they
just kind of pass it off.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to do
to get people to realize

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:90%
this is happening to me?

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I mean,
I think about my own life

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and how if I had not
listened to the nudge

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about
angels, or to the nudge

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
to actually talk about
angels in front of people

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and share my story, how crazy
different my life would be.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that our
intuition, our divine guidance,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.427 align:middle line:84%
is constantly trying
to set us free.

00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
trying to break us out

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
of our emotional prison,
our financial prison,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
our creative prison,
our relationship prison,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
but the only way that
spirit can really

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
intervene for us is
through our intuition,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
through our gut feelings.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it is imperative
that we kind of

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
take that side of ourselves
seriously and ask ourselves

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
what if this is possible,
and then go in that direction

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
because really, the only way
you're really going to find out

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
if your intuition is
right is doing what

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:90%
your intuition is guiding you--

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:90%
within reason.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.678 align:middle line:84%
So I do want to say
there's a caveat here

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people talk
about open your intuition.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Listen to your intuition, but
you also have to use logic,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: And a lot of
people miss that step.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sounded like
Bruce Willis from "Die Hard."

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: I do?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, for a
split-- go to New York.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Have a good time.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that line was.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Angels-- remember the movie,
"It's a Wonderful Life"

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
with Jimmy Stewart?

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The classic movie.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
He was despondent.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to end
his life, and he

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:90%
was going to jump into a river.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing on
the bridge contemplating

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
when he's about ready to
jump, and all of a sudden

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
there's a guy in
the river drowning.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Help, help!

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
He dives in and
saves the guy's life,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
pulls him out, forgets
about committing suicide,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:90%
and saves the guy.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guy turned out to be
his guardian angel, Clarence,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:90%
who was sent down to save him.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Does it happen that way?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I think
sometimes it does,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's way
more subtle than that.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just
an opportunity,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe a new thought, a new
inspiration, or a new dream.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.058 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone is
just miserable at work

00:09:34.058 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and they, gosh, they
hate their boss.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or in a
relationship or anything.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.558 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Oh, my gosh,
in a relationship.

00:09:38.558 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Essentially in anything
that feels like crap.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:10%
We don't give ourselves
a chance to dream bigger

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:10%
because the voice of doubt
kind of overpowers us,

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:10%
but what I've learned
from the angels

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:10%
and what I teach
people around the world

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:10%
is that there's
another voice in there,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:00.685 align:middle line:10%
and it's our duty to begin
to open up to the possibility

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:10%
that that positive
voice in there

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:10%
is way more real
than the negative one

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:10%
trying to tear us down.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.857 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
stress it's not always

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
like three birds dividing into
three to get your attention.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I was that dense,
that low vibration,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:90%
that I needed something.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I needed a cosmic smack in the
head to kind of wake me up.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody needs that.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people that right,
right now, the angels

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:90%
are right there.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.797 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit team is
right here, right now.

00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we call them,
or do they just show up?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.922 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, they're
here, but they definitely

00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
come closer the more that we
become adept at calling them

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of ways.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
But they're here.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.982 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
putting them to work,

00:10:39.982 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
asking for the right things
and putting them to work.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
them or feel them?

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Both, but my
biggest sense is feeling.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So I can feel the
presence of spirit.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I can feel truth.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
spiritual gifts that we have.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Some of us are more visual.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of us are more sensing.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I was first activated
with the presence of spirit

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
around me, so when that
bird divided into three,

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
it was an incredible feeling
of goosebumps up and down,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and this incredible love.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so with
clients and in general,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I can feel when there's
angels in the room.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.748 align:middle line:84%
And then on a
really good day, I'm

00:11:19.748 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:90%
seeing them in full apparition.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they look like?

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Do they have wings?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, they appear
in a lot of different ways

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So I've definitely seen some
with wings, but I would say

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
it's not like--

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they family
members who passed on?

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Who are they?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well,
there's different kinds

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:90%
of beings out there.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's angels, and then
there's loved ones, ancestors.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the more
practice that you

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
work with your intuition, the
more that you learn to discern

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%
what is what-- is it a fairy?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it an alien,
or is it an angel?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Who's coming in right now?

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jean Slatter appeared
on the Gaia program "Open

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Minds" talking about
several reasons that give us

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.918 align:middle line:90%
trouble accessing the truth.

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at that, and I want

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:90%
you to react to what she means.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>JEAN SLATTER: There's
actually four main reasons why

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:10%
we have difficulty
accessing our truth,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:10%
and the first one is the
filters that we have.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:10%
We've talked about
the experiment

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:10%
that was done with the gorilla.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
that was embarrassing.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.023 align:middle line:10%
I did that one.

00:12:19.023 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:10%
There were a whole
bunch of us, and this

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:10%
is the video of the basketball
players throwing the balls back

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:10%
and forth, right, and
the gorilla passing

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:10%
through the room.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.825 align:middle line:10%
So you can find it on YouTube.

00:12:28.825 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember
what it's under,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:10%
but I think using those
search words, you can find it.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: The missing gorilla.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, the
missing gorilla, OK.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
so an audience was

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:10%
asked to watch how often the
people in the white t-shirts

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:10%
passed the basketball, so they
are focused in on just that.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
our mind works.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
We pick a focus, and we
don't see anything else.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, a gorilla
walks into the room,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and thumps his chest,
and then walks off.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the audience is
asked, did you see the gorilla?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what gorilla?

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: You know--

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:10%
I know because I
did it at the time--

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:10%
you all-- spoiler alert--
you know what it is now,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.353 align:middle line:10%
but for those who haven't
done it, I did it,

00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:10%
and there were a few other
people in the room that did it.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Only one out of the group
of us saw the gorilla.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
I did not see the gorilla.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.015 align:middle line:90%
I was so focused.

00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was so embarrassing.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You think, how can the brain
trick ourselves like that?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- I thank
you for bringing it up.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most shocking
demonstrations of the filters

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:90%
we use.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.108 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
if we should have

00:13:31.108 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:90%
a gorilla walk through the set.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I
bet you have already

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.595 align:middle line:90%
and I just didn't notice.

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would anybody see it?

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.508 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I don't know.

00:13:36.508 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
does that all mean?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I mean, I
love what she's saying here.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a hyper focus.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to put
this to real life.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So right now, your viewers
right now are getting inspired.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
They're getting inspiration
from the divine,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
from their angels to make
a change that's beautiful,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
or maybe to be of
service to the world

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
or to their families
in a different way.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But because they're so
focused on the thing that's

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
right in front of them,
they will miss the guidance.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that,
especially when we're

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to up-level our
lives, take the next level,

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
or make a big power move, that
we realize what we're doing,

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
the hyper focus, and
do take steps back

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.445 align:middle line:84%
to be able to open up our
antennas to the inspiration.

00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know that little
voice we hear in our heads?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't do
this, do this, do that.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that an angel, or is that us?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Who's telling us these things?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I think
sometimes it's a combination.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point
what spirit and what

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
the angels showed me is
that a lot of our thoughts,

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
we think they're unique
to us, but sometimes it

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is a different energy
coming in feeding us.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's an angel,
and it's a beautiful way

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to really think about
your own thoughts.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you have guidance
or an inspiration

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to move your life in
a certain direction

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and it excites you,
however, it's a little scary

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
require some change,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you rather
follow that voice

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of the angel than the one
that's tearing you down?

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you can see
it as your own voice,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
but I do like to see
the positive inspiration

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:90%
as angelic.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we summon angels,
or do they just show up?

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, I think
they're just here,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.662 align:middle line:90%
but there are powerful ways--

00:15:17.662 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
everywhere, right?

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.328 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: They're everywhere.

00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're
interdimensional, and from what

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:10%
I've seen, even people who
had never spoken to angels

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:10%
or called on angels, when they
came into my office, there

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:10%
was always angels around them.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do
is I teach people

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
how to powerfully talk to them
so that they make sure they're

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.123 align:middle line:90%
more attractive, more visible.

00:15:38.123 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:90%
How would you do that?

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Take us through that scenario.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.845 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I work a
lot with invocation,

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
which is a really traditional
way of doing magic.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:10%
And so calling on any priest
is doing an invocation first.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask the
angels to come you.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:84%
You ask them for-- well,
always give gratitude.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude is important,
but then you ask them

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:90%
for a certain something.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to feel better
about a breakup, Archangel

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Michael, I ask that you come
to me now and release me

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
from the pain that's
in my heart, thank you.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Please help me, yeah.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And then you wait.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
You wait, and you imagine
that that angel is there

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:90%
coming and releasing you.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how many
people can feel a shift

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and change within minutes.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
If they go through that,
even the very simple step,

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:90%
of doing that.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of people
don't do is they

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
don't wait for the change,
the energetic change

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
inside of them.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
They just, help me, and then
they move on to the next thing

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
because they're moving
too fast through life.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So it is important
to sit and experience

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the shift and the
transformation after you invoke.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
angel know already

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
what you need without us asking?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.975 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:16:53.975 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're hesitating.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well,
here's the thing,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
you know what you need more than
any other being on the planet

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.093 align:middle line:90%
or outside the planet.

00:17:03.093 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we should.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: We should.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have the
blueprint inside of us.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a purpose,
and we know who we

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:90%
are at it at an essence level.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I like to always
empower the human first

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and say you know what you
do if you follow your joy.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:90%
Follow your joy.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Then you call on an angel to
come and help you rather than

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
begging something outside
of yourself for direction.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's nice to pray
and ask for guidance,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
but I think a lot of
people displace their power

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
onto people and other things
outside of themselves.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But over time I
realized, and I've really

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
seen with my own
clients and the people

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, that they
have the blueprint in here,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and what they need angel
and divine support with most

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
is to execute that plan,
execute that blueprint.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the angel always
perform, or do they sometimes

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
not show up?

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I
mean, a lot of times

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
you can feel like the angels
are not coming through for you.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel like
you're alone, right?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, it's like,
well, that didn't work out.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But I always like to give
an example of someone who's

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
wishing that their boyfriend
would come back to them,

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and they beg the
angels, please, help me.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:90%
I need him back.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I just love him so much.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And it just doesn't work out.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.817 align:middle line:84%
He runs off with someone
else and gets married.

00:18:19.817 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They might think that the angels
didn't come through for them,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
but really the angels
did come through

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because that other person
was probably just a punk

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and not really great for them,
and at a heart level, essence

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:84%
level, they're preparing you for
something that's even better.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
we ask for things

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that are not in alignment for
our best and highest good.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And in those cases,
angels often don't--

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, spirit doesn't
collude with that.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But what they do do is
collude with something that's

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
in alignment for your joy,
for your heart, for your soul,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and if you like
to be of service,

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
they really love helping
people to be of service.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you ask
for something unrealistic?

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.962 align:middle line:90%
Will they still try to help you?

00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you
mean by unrealistic?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, a goal
that may not be reachable.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe you
want $10 million,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.967 align:middle line:90%
something that's ludicrous.

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Right, well, I mean,
maybe it's not ludicrous.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I say if it feels
out of reach for you,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
ask anyways because
there's no harm to ask

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:90%
for $100 million company.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Or I mean in my case,
even what I'm doing today

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
was, 10 years ago, far beyond
anything that seemed realistic.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So I say ask for the vision.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure it's coming
from the right place.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
manifestation mean to you?

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
manifesting is, I

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:47.670 align:middle line:84%
think, when a human claims
their right to the life

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.337 align:middle line:84%
that they desire
and they deserve.

00:19:49.337 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And they can do it in a
variety of different ways.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.477 align:middle line:90%
They can do it through magic.

00:19:53.477 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Meditation.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.518 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Through meditation.

00:19:55.518 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I love working with angels
because angels tend to expedite

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:90%
the manifesting process.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
People talk a lot about
the Law of Attraction,

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like working
with-- including

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:84%
angels in that formula puts
your manifestations on steroids.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.558 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I think
so, yeah, for me.

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
important to manifest?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It depends
on who you are.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's into it, and
I say just more power to you

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:90%
if you're not into it.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a desire and
feel limited by your income

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
level, limited by your
skin color, by your gender,

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
by your sexual preference,
if society isn't kind to you,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
then I feel like you
call in extra resources.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's essentially
why I love angels

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:10%
because it's a great balancing
force, a great equalizer.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can call on
spirit, the spirit

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
does not care what your
income is, what your color is,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:90%
what your gender is.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to balance
out the playground,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
then it behooves you
to work with angels

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and to learn as much as
you can about manifesting.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spirit medium
James Van Praagh--

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:90%
he's a genius at what he does--

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.705 align:middle line:90%
talks about manifestation.

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: When
we want something to

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:10%
manifest in our lives,
so we put it out there.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:10%
Let's say we visualize it, we
meditate about manifestation,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:10%
and we can have that if we
stay with that frequency.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:10%
Think of it like this, think
about it like a radio station,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:10%
and that you're tuning into
a certain dial, 106.7, right?

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
You're at 106.7 and
you're tuning into that,

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
visualizing, I want this,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
let's say, I want this type
of job, a type of relationship

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I want this material
thing like a car.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is in your life,
and you're tuning into it,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
but there's a part of you which
might not allow it exactly

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:90%
like you're saying.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So if your vibratory
rate, and I'm just

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
saying it's 106.7 like a
radio, so if your frequency

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
or your vibratory rate
is here, but you're only

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
tuning it to 96.7, you're
not going to get it, see?

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're not allowing
yourself to experience

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
the fullness of that vibration,
of that vortex of coming

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
into that oneness of
being, and really into--

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
whether it's feelings of
deserving, feelings of guilt,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
feelings of limitation,
feelings of inadequacy,

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might be,
you're exactly right.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not feeling worthy at
that vibrational rate, yes.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to
manifest, materialize,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to be at
that frequency,

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and the more one
has a relationship

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
with their true self,
their spiritual self,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual creative
being, and whether that's

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
done through disciplines
of meditation,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's done through
contemplation in prayer,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's done through yoga,
however you can quiet the mind

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and get to that space
of creative self,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
we are all creative
beings of god,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and we can accept
and allow ourselves

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to get to that higher
frequency, and receive,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and really manifest whatever
we want in our lives.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
So we really have the abundance.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:90%
It's within us.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just having the
awareness-- so we already

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.843 align:middle line:84%
have the abundance-- but
it's having the awareness

00:22:49.843 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to bring yourself full
to that experience,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.052 align:middle line:90%
to that manifestation.

00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I like
what he says there.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, me too.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes a lot
of sense, doesn't it?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
To manifest like that,
that's important.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Must you manifest before you
can accomplish something?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to
visualize it first?

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Well, yes.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you need to
have an inspiration

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:84%
or have an idea in
order to know what

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
actions you need to take
in order to make it happen.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So yes, but for people who
are interested in manifesting,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I love to create a ceremony
and ritual around it.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.097 align:middle line:84%
So if you that you are going
to create your own company,

00:23:27.097 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're shifting
from 9:00 to 5:00,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
or over to your other
gig, or your new job,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
manifesting works really well if
you create some level of ritual

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.320 align:middle line:84%
around it, and you call
in spiritual allies

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to come and support
you because it's

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
like hiring a staff to
take care of your needs,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to bring you the right people,
the right kind of support,

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:90%
the right ideas.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
keys to manifesting

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that most people
leave out is the fact

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that it's on you to finish
the dream because spirit

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:90%
and manifesting--

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always on us.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I mean,
we can only do so much.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you're still like,
hey, I did this big ritual,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.005 align:middle line:84%
and then I prayed, and then
I called in this angel,

00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:84%
but you're still sitting on the
couch eating a slice of pizza,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
drinking a beer, and you're not
getting up and actually taking

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
action steps, take the
action steps first, and then

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:90%
beer bong.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Do whatever you want, but
take the action steps first,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people think
spirits are just going

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen for you.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one of
the greatest angelic stories

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that has come to you
not necessarily on you,

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.885 align:middle line:90%
but that you've heard about.

00:24:31.885 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: One of the best--

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where maybe a
client had something happen.

00:24:36.167 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Did they share their
stories with you?

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I
hear a lot of stories,

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's really touching.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, just this
December I was teaching

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:90%
a training on angel magic.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching
specific skill sets,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and this woman came in because
her sister was in the hospital

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and had just gotten
word from the doctor

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that her sister
didn't have much time.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Those are the worst times, too.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: The worst, so
she had cancer, and then

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:12.263 align:middle line:84%
on top of that had a very bad
lung disease on top of that.

00:25:12.263 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
that was going wrong

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:90%
was going wrong for this person.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It was
going wrong, so I

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:84%
mean, in order for
doctors to call it,

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be
really grim and bad.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So they told her to
start making arrangements

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and that she wouldn't
have much time.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So she got together.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
She called on Archangel
Raphael, and she got together

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
with a few members of our
community to do prayer

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and to create a ritual
around her sister's healing.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
The next morning
her sister texted

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
her-- her dying sister texted
her saying, hey, what's up?

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.487 align:middle line:84%
And she hadn't really
talked to her sister.

00:25:44.487 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was feeling better.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.112 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: She's feeling better.

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:90%
And she called the doctor--

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, my client called the
doctor, and the doctor

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:90%
said something radical happened.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.352 align:middle line:90%
By this morning she was fine.

00:25:56.352 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:90%
She was looking around.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.643 align:middle line:90%
We have her in a different unit.

00:25:58.643 --> 00:25:59.705 align:middle line:90%
She's not in ICU anymore.

00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: And within
that week, she was fully

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:90%
released from the hospital.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Recovered?

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Recovered, yeah.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a miracle.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, that's
what I'm saying.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a miracle.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Miracles are real.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:90%
It's really something.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Wow, yeah.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, I am shocked-- the
reason why I spend so much time

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
talking about angels is
not just because it's fun--

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:90%
and it is a lot of fun--

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's not because I have
this need to proselytize,

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:90%
it's because it works.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:10%
And working with the divine
and doing this kind of work

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:10%
creates extraordinarily
practical solutions

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:10%
to some of life's most
impractical problems.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talk a lot about
aliens on these programs.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
angels aren't ET's?

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.658 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I mean,
I don't know if we do.

00:26:49.658 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
who you're asking.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
rule that out.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I do not rule
anything out anymore

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen enough to know
I'm not ruling anything out,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:84%
but just depending on who
the eye of the beholder--

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to some people, people
take great comfort

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in believing that it's aliens
that are here to help us.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Other people take great
comfort in angels.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
The angels came to
me as angels, which

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is why I call them
angels, but when

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
you look at the old books
in the Old Testament,

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and you look at Ezekiel's
story with the chariot of fire

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.382 align:middle line:84%
coming down, and
wheels, and I mean--

00:27:21.382 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks like a UFO.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.392 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It's very
suspiciously alien-ish.

00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's something,
something weird.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: So I
don't think that it

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.990 align:middle line:84%
has to be the strict
separation between the two.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I think we can adapt
angels to the time,

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
but I do feel like they're--
not all aliens are angels,

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you
talk about Ezekiel's wheel,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people have
talked about orbs

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:90%
and what they may be.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Are they angelic, or
extraterrestrial, or spirits?

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, but author
Stewart Pearce,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
on the Gaia program "Open
Minds," talked about that.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART PEARCE: I never ever
saw the angels as a human being

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:10%
with wings, looking like, as
you say, a blond Caucasian,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:10%
or indeed an angel with
black skin, or yellow skin,

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:10%
or red skin.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:10%
These beings were always
extraordinary columns of light,

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:10%
or these brilliant orbs,
which I learned early

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:10%
were plasmic forces,
that they were

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:10%
refractions of photonic light.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:90%
That they said, we are plasma.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:90%
We are made of fire.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Just as you are made of star
seed, we are made of fire.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.815 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we have a
lineage that is corresponding,

00:28:31.815 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
it's just that your
physical form is somewhat

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:90%
different to ours, yeah.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And that
was very validating for myself,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and I think will be for many,
many people watching this

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:90%
because I often see these orbs.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I see certain colors of
orbs around certain people,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and when certain truths
are being spoken,

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
a very specific type of
orb and color comes in.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And I had always thought,
gee, what a shame.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see those
angels with wings,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and I don't see--
that's not how I see it.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Just as you say, columns
of light and orbs.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't that we're
deficient in some way

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
in our inner sight.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, it's very
interesting, isn't it,

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
because now we're becoming
more aware of all phenomenon,

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and vastly aware because
of digital photography.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember way before
the digital photography

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
scene became the
fashionable thing,

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
or became within our attention,
where the angel said to me,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
what do you know
about angelology?

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the tone was
almost scornful.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I was chastened.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was
to spend as much time

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
as possible in some of the great
libraries of the world really

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:90%
delving into angelology.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are asking very
considerable living mystics

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that were very useful to me,
such as the wonderful Rupert

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Sheldrake, writing
about the genetic field,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and this unique
conversation that he

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
had with Matthew Fox, whose
teaching I absolutely admire.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
However, there I was in
these world great libraries

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and reading about
Hildegard Von Bingen,

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and reading about
Dionysius the Areopagite,

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and John of the
Cross, and they all

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:90%
said angels are orbs of light.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:90%
They were seeing orbs of light.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, when was Hildegard
living, 12th century?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's apparent that there is
something very extraordinary

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
about the geometry of
the orb, or at least

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
the circular manifestation.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And I understand in
terms of sacred acoustics

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that the very high
vibrations of sound

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
are also cyclic or
orb-like when they

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
move from the
wave-like manifestation

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:84%
that we see into the
very higher frequencies.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not a scientist.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody is
listening to this

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and has corroboration of
what that's all about,

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd be very interested.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
be disappointed

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:84%
if angels were extraterrestrials
and not angelic?

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Not at all.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would not be?

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.427 align:middle line:90%
I would be.

00:30:51.427 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: You would?

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.608 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: But to me, I
don't make a separation.

00:30:54.608 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to know that
they're heavenly and god-like.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, maybe aliens
are heavenly and godlike,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:90%
or the right ones.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in my perspective, George,
I've kind of looked at this--

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
when I look historically,
even at cave paintings,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and how humans are
right next to beings

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that look inhuman,
what I know is that

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
of time, people

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:84%
have reported all over the
world that there are beings here

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
to support and help us.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I do not care what
they label them.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not attached to the
religious explanation.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not attached to
the alien explanation.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm just glad
they're here to help,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and I will continue to work with
them even if their identity is

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:90%
aliens would be revealed.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
they're not here to trick you?

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.063 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Oh, that's
a great question,

00:31:44.063 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and I think more people need
to talk about discernment.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So spirits, just
like humans, you

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:84%
have to have discernment
because sometimes words

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
don't match the energy
behind what people say

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:90%
or what angels say.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So in particular,
a lot of people

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
have a vision of an
angel, but that angel

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
might be telling you
to do something weird.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
That would be a sign
that it's an impostor,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
so we do have to kind of watch
out, especially for people.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I almost feel like people can
be more dangerous than demons.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that could be.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: So I say watch
out for the people first,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but angelic pattern
is really specific.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You will feel a sense of
peace when it's an angel.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You will not feel a sense
of-- what you won't feel

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:84%
is prickly, or cold,
or an emptiness.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So it is important
for you to really

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
not just see what you're seeing
and hear what you're hearing,

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but to feel the feeling
behind it and put it to task.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.410 align:middle line:84%
If it's a negative voice,
it's a negative entity.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will a good person
attract a good entity?

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes and no.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really great
people get hoodwinked

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
by all kinds of-- by all
kinds of humans, too.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:90%
So again, I'm equating it--

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:84%
based on your
relationship with humans,

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
If you need boundaries
with humans,

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need boundaries
with your spirit team.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what you're
saying is, not necessarily.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Not necessarily, no.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it's
not a slam dunk you're

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:90%
going to get a good angel.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, you're
going to get good angels,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.182 align:middle line:84%
but there's imposters and
hitchhikers all around us.

00:33:21.182 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
distinguish the difference?

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:90%
How do you know that?

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: You learn to listen.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
developing your intuition

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
is so important in
the sense that you

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.422 align:middle line:84%
have to know which voice is
talking because a lot of people

00:33:33.422 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:90%
listen to the negative voice.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you learned that?

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.872 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I'm getting
better and better, but yes.

00:33:37.872 --> 00:33:39.888 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been working
on this for 10 years.

00:33:39.888 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trial and error?

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, but
none of us-- all of us

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
are susceptible to dark voices,
and I would almost rather

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
call them dark voices
than demons, right?

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're
susceptible to negativity.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're one
in the same, isn't it?

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: What was that?

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dark voices and demons,
aren't they one in the same?

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I think there's
different kinds of dark voices.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.148 align:middle line:84%
There's dark spirits
of maybe humans

00:33:58.148 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:90%
that have haven't crossed over.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a house, and you
feel oppressed, and get out.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:90%
The voice says get out.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's not
necessarily a demon, in theory.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just a cranky
old man that never crossed over.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My neighbor.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: You know him.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I know him well.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
What techniques can people
use to summon angels?

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Like I said, one of
my favorites is invocation.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.418 align:middle line:84%
But again, just the awareness of
knowing that angels are real--

00:34:27.418 --> 00:34:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or you don't even have to
know that they're real-- just

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.918 align:middle line:90%
believing that it's possible.

00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Believe that they are.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: You can be
hyper skeptical about it.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter, but act
more scientific about it.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You can open it up and
say, hey, if you're real,

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
help me with this,
whatever it is.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can do more
traditional kinds

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:90%
of invocations or prayers.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:90%
You can light a candle.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.400 align:middle line:84%
There's not a one size
fits all for everyone,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:84%
but there are more powerful
ways to call on the divine.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.322 align:middle line:90%
Invocation is one of them.

00:34:57.322 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
somebody comes to you

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:84%
as a client, what are
they asking you for?

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
What do they want
you to do for them?

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Well, they'll
ask for a lot of external--

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:10%
they'll ask for a lot of
things, but ultimately I

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:10%
know that every
client that's coming

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:10%
to me that's asking for help
from the divine, what they're

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.875 align:middle line:10%
really asking for is peace.

00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Inner peace?

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: They just want peace.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Many times they
won't ask for that.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.655 align:middle line:84%
They'll ask for help
with their relationship.

00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Can angels help me
with a relationship?

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.697 align:middle line:84%
Can they help me
with my finances?

00:35:25.697 --> 00:35:27.245 align:middle line:84%
Can they help me
with my business?

00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Can they help me--
but they want peace.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you need
an angel to do that?

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they do it themselves?

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, we are
polluted with our history,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
with all the stories
that we tell ourselves,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.223 align:middle line:90%
with our trauma from--

00:35:43.223 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
there's just so many
things that can go wrong,

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and it crusts us over
and it closes our hearts.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So working with the divine
and asking angels to help,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
what it does is, it doesn't
put anything new inside of you.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It helps that which
is you, the loving,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:84%
peaceful being deep on the
inside, start emerging.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So angels help you come
into deeper contact with who

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
you naturally are,
and the more that you

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:84%
take a practice of that, the
more that the rest falls away.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So I actually see angels
not just, hey, come help me,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
but I see angels
and walking the path

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
with angels as a way to activate
your consciousness, to raise

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we succeed without
tapping into the angelic realm?

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well,
when you say we--

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We as humans.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Sure,
people can succeed.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I think we can, but
I think we're not

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:84%
going to get all the way
there unless all of us

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.793 align:middle line:84%
have a reckoning with
our spiritual nature

00:36:37.793 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and with our spiritual side.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.168 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, do you
think every successful person

00:36:41.168 --> 00:36:43.090 align:middle line:10%
has been helped by an angel?

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, I think every
person period, whether they're

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
successful or not, has had
many interventions of support

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and help.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And that goes to if you
think about all the times

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
a certain person came into your
life just in the nick of time,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that is divine
inspiration or divine--

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone can
think of one person that

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.930 align:middle line:84%
came into their life
where it's amazing timing.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.797 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's predestined?

00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: You can
call it pre-destiny.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You can use whatever
words, but spirit is always

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:90%
colluding to support you.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's our own resistance,
our own belief in ourselves,

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and our own unwillingness
to even admit

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that there's another world
besides this 3D world

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:90%
that we can see.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of us are really
cut off from that reality

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.170 align:middle line:84%
because of how many
religions have kind of given

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:90%
spirituality bad press.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
feeling that the angels let you

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
down?

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: I have not,
no, because I also

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:10%
know that it's not
the angel's job

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:10%
to make life wonderful
100% of the time.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:90%
We're in a human body.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We came here for a reason,
and with life comes hardship.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:90%
We have losses.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:90%
We lose people in our lives.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It ain't
easy, as they say.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: It ain't easy,
but angels can really help--

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:10%
I think the best word that
I can say is, insulate you.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you have
to be religious?

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: No.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To tap into them?

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I was not a
religious person when

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:90%
that activation had with me.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I am still not
religious in any way,

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.080 align:middle line:84%
although I have a deep
respect for religion.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I consider myself a mystic.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you continue
to help people cross over

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:90%
to the other side?

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: You
cross over to love.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, again, it's about--

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I was given the--
what's the word?

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.292 align:middle line:84%
I guess the blessing
or the gift of--

00:38:43.292 --> 00:38:45.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The gift, you
were given the gift.

00:38:45.083 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, and it
came out of nowhere,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.872 align:middle line:84%
and so I have no intention of
hoarding it towards myself.

00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
most satisfying thing

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
you do to yourself?

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: For myself?

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that has come
to you because of your actions.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: I think
the level of joy

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.810 align:middle line:10%
that I experience
inside that I then get

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:10%
to connect other people with.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How can people
get a hold of you?

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: They can
go to my website.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Coringrillo.com.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Corin, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Thanks, George.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:19.557 align:middle line:10%
I love being here.

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's great.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.140 align:middle line:90%
You do a great job for people.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, thanks, George.
