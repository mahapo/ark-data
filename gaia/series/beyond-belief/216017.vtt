00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: It's
been over a decade

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:10%
since the disappearance of
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:10%
They call it MH370.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:10%
And we have yet to have
any real concrete answers.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Ashton Forbes, an
IT consultant, began

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
investigating the
disappearance of MH370

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
after footage leaked on the
internet just two years ago.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
He believes the footage shows
the plane being abducted

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:90%
by what appears to be UFOs.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
However, these are not
extraterrestrial UFOs,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
but UFOs created, he
says, by the US Navy.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Ashton, welcome to the program.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ASHTON FORBES:
Thank you, Mr. Noory.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for being here--
thank you for having me.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.353 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a bizarre case.

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
239 people, including crew,
disappeared on March 8th, 2014.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The plane
has yet to be found.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
That's unheard of--

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in modern
day technology.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.915 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Absolutely.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is 11 years
later and the plane

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:10%
is still completely missing.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing that people
have to realize in this case

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:10%
is that planes don't
disappear in 2014.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
The engines are
supposedly being tracked.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:10%
We have hundreds of, if not
thousands of satellites,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:10%
back in 2014.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:10%
Now we have tens of
thousands of potentially

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:10%
of satellites in the sky.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:84%
We have acoustic systems that
can hear a tiny submersible

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
implode near the Titanic.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So we would have
heard a plane crash.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And then lastly, we have
these over-the-horizon radars,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
including one called the
Jindalee Operational Radar

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Network in Australia.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They can see for
thousands of miles.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
How is it that nobody
saw this plane?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all the evidence
that was never released,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
we have satellite
data, acoustics

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
information,
telephone information.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was ever put
out to the public.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, there's some
form of cover up at play.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the plane was going
from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:10.745 align:middle line:90%
in China.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:11.545 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yep.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was flying for only
40 minutes and then disappeared.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yep.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing is that
there was so much confusion

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:90%
when the plane disappeared.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Like what time did it
actually disappear?

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Where exactly did it disappear?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
40 minutes after
the plane takes off,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.763 align:middle line:84%
it's over the South China
Sea flying to Beijing.

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: And it goes dark.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oof.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Why did the plane
go dark at that moment?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
all the witnesses,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
you find out that
everybody was pointing

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to some type of emergency event,
some type of fire type event.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Mike Mackay was on
an oil rig staring

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
at the plane at that point
when the plane went dark.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the plane on
fire for a few seconds.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened to the plane?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It turned around.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an
automatic turnaround.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They could tell
based on the angle

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
that it was a manual turn back.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And where does the
pilot take the plane?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They take it to the
closest airport,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
which is Penang Airport, that
can land-- a Boeing 777 can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:90%
land there safely.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.865 align:middle line:84%
And you come from
an IT background.

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about that.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.575 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in healthcare
IT my entire life.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I tell people that I am nobody
special with respect to this.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I never grew up in
the UFO community

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
learning the lore of
the UFO community.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to
be somebody that

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:84%
saw the MH370 videos
in August of 2023

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
online just like everybody else.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.195 align:middle line:84%
And I said instead of
everybody else was saying,

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
these videos have to be
fake, they have to be fake.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, what would it
take for these videos

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:90%
to actually be real?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
If those videos are
real, there must

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
be some corroborating evidence
in the story of the plane,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
in the videos themselves, or
in the science that is being

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
presented in those videos.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've dedicated my
life to the last two years,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
outside of my normal
job, is trying

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to understand all those aspects,
understand what really happened

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
to this missing
plane, understand

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
the type of
technology that might

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
be out there in black
projects, and to try

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is the
nature of those videos

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and who recorded them, how
did they get on the internet.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
everything that you

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
could imagine about the
situation of the plane,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
apparently two sources

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
for the so-called leak videos
of the disappearance of MH370.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They are videos from a US
satellite and a US drone.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to focus
on the satellite first,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to tell
us what we're looking at.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And it took
us about two years

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to first understand what
the satellite video is.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The satellite video just
says satellite video airliner

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs, in the name of it.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And it says received
March 12, 2014,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
which is only four days
after the plane disappeared.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: It also
says source protected,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
which would imply that this
would potentially be a leak.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the date
it was actually uploaded

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.895 align:middle line:84%
on the internet though, it was
published on YouTube may 19th,

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
2014.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is about 70 days
after the plane disappeared.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this is of-- the first piece
of evidence is the timeline.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a timeline now where
we have a very narrow window

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of time where this
video was 100% confirmed

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
to be on the internet after
the plane disappeared.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
the description,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
then that narrow window
of time is so small

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that there's no possible way
the videos could be faked.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.873 align:middle line:84%
Four days after the
plane disappeared,

00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
we were still searching in
the South China Sea then.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the satellite
video is not actually

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
looking through a satellite
that's flying around the Earth.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.033 align:middle line:90%
It's more complicated than that.

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
The United States
military has something

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
called WAMI, Wide
Area Motion Imagery.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I think we've actually
identified the exact asset that

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:90%
is recording that as Argus IR.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Argus IR is a version
of this WAMI footage.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And this WAMI footage,
Wide Area Motion Imagery,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
can take data from
multiple assets,

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
like a satellite in the sky,
from a drone that's flying,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
a high altitude plane, and they
beam it through relay satellites

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
to a ground-based computer.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they store all
that data in giant--

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: --servers.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And they can create a
virtual playback environment

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
of possibly anywhere
on the planet,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
but anywhere they
had those assets.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking at is one
of the first questions people

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:90%
ask is why were they filming?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Who's filming this?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's doing it?

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And the answer
is there's only one answer.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:90%
It has to be an operation.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The only reason why they
have multiple assets filming,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
including this satellite
video, which is really

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
this massive Wide
Area Motion Imagery,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is because this whole
thing was planned out.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They had the whole operation
on this plane planned out ahead

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no accident here?

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: There's no accident.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big secret
about these videos.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody who has no problem
believing in aliens and UFOs,

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm open minded to that.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But those videos are not
showing aliens or UFOs.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.277 align:middle line:84%
They're showing a government
operation that was planned out

00:07:13.277 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, and
that's the only reason why

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:90%
those assets are even there.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's happening
in that WAMI footage?

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.477 align:middle line:84%
Somebody on a computer, and
they've pulled up a window.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So they, in the background,
they can see, imagine,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:90%
like all of this, a major city.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And they press somewhere on the
screen and a window pops up.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And now they're doing
a video tracking

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:84%
playback of an airplane, a
person, anything that they want.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And the person who's
actually recording that

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
is moving the cursor
around and they're

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
pressing the middle
mouse and they're

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:90%
moving the screen around.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is they're
recording just the window.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we see these orbs
circle around the plane.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They do this dance, and then
the plane, poof, disappears.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The operator moves the screen
further to the right afterwards.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
They want to show
us there's no plane.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not hiding over to
the right or anything.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
thing that happens

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is the mouse cursor goes to
the top right of the screen,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and then the screen goes black.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Why does the screen go black?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they closed the window
that they were looking at.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And the screen is
still recording,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.017 align:middle line:84%
but it's recording
a black window.

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
one more minute

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
of black recording in
that, which to me I think

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
is extremely powerful evidence.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But if that's not
enough, that same video

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:90%
has satellite coordinates in it.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:84%
There are coordinates in the
bottom left or GPS coordinates.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It says N-R-O-L-22.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it has six decimal
places of coordinates,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
just like you would
see in Google Earth.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And they only move when
the screen moves around.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
These coordinates are the real
location of Malaysian Airlines

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
flight 370 in the Nicobar
Islands on March 7th at 1840

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:90%
UTC.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Here's the craziest part.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
1840 UTC, that location,
if you go look back

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
at when Malaysian Airlines
disappeared, back to our--

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
March 8th, 2014.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And the
time, that was the time

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
they said they lost contact
with the plane originally.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:90%
They changed the time later on.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You can find-- there's a report
that says Subang air traffic

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
control lost contact with
Malaysian Airlines at 2:40 AM,

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.118 align:middle line:90%
also known as 1840 UTC.

00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
think the plane went?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: So this
is the big mystery,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
is that it seems like
they just created

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
this fake story of the plane
going into the South Indian

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
That location in
the Nicobar Islands

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
is the location where they
say these satellite pings

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
say, oh, the plane

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
just took a south
turn right here

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:90%
and just flew for five hours--

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.753 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --the pilot.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.532 align:middle line:84%
There was testimony about that,
that he took it into a dive.

00:09:56.532 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And that's
the thing about that

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is that there was a Cardiff
University paper that

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
was published in May of
2024, and they did tests

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:84%
on all different angles
that the plane would

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
have dived into the
water-based on its mass.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.252 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what, it
would have created a shock

00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
wave so powerful that it would
have measured on the Richter

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
scale.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Like a two or to
three earthquake

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
would have been detected,
and they would have heard it.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shouldn't we
have been able to find it

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%
with today's technology?

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: No question,
we would have found it.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
absurd part about this.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember that Titan sub that
imploded off the Titanic?

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.092 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: The Navy heard
it the moment it happened.

00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't say anything.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
For five days, they didn't
say anything about it.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And then five days later,
they come out admit, oh, yep,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.025 align:middle line:84%
we heard that
implode immediately.

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, we're
going to go pick it up.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So not only did they
hear it immediately,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and this is a tiny
submersible, they

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
triangulated the exact
location of the debris as well.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
They've got this
system called SOSUS.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the Sound
Surveillance System.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The Navy's had it
for 70 years or so.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
They actually declassified it
in the 90s because they have

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:90%
something better now.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And they can pinpoint
anything that

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
happens in the ocean,
basically anywhere.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely ludicrous
to think that they somehow

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
don't know what happened to
this massive airplane that

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
been talk that there

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
was a fire on board the plane.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear that?

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: This was an event that
was not really widely discussed.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually researched
the fire event around MH370,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
you will find at least
two major stories

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
by experts that were
adamant, that there

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
must have been a
lithium ion battery

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%
fire on board this plane.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
One of them, Billy Vincent,
former security director

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of the FAA, he speculated
that before it was even

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.658 align:middle line:84%
known that there were
batteries on board the plane.

00:11:48.658 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up
reaching out to him

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and having a long conversation
with him about it.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And even 10 years later,
he's more convinced

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was a fire on board
the plane because the scenario

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:90%
was so similar to UPS Flight 6.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was a cargo plane
but had a similar issue, where

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:90%
they had lithium ion batteries.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot was not even able
to get the hood on before he

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
was knocked out unconscious.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And the co-pilot
couldn't land the plane

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
because the smoke was
occluding the windshield.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So in that situation, they
ended up crashing the plane

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and both of them ended up dying.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And so Billy Vincent
was convinced

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that some situation
like that must

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
have happened at MH370
because of the flight path,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
because of the
batteries, et cetera.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And another guy, Dr.
Ettel, also speculated,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a Daily Beast
article about that,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%
that this plane was on fire.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And looking at it, it
seems just no doubt,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:90%
it must have been a fire event.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
There are 20 witnesses,
including Mike McKay,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:90%
who I spoke of earlier.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
There are eight
people along the coast

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that heard loud noises the same
exact moment the plane went

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:90%
dark.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They were fishermen that were
about 10 miles away from where

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:90%
the plane turned around.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And they see this
plane flying low,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
which would indicate
not that it's

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:84%
a pilot that's trying to knock
everybody out on the plane.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
oxygen into the plane

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:90%
because it's on fire.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a fire on the plane.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
one is Katherine Tee.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:90%
She's probably the star witness.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
She's right near
the Nicobar Islands,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
within 100 miles of the
coordinates in the satellite

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%
video.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And she has this
detailed sighting

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of seeing this
glowing orange plane,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.395 align:middle line:84%
with this hazy glow to it,
flying low with no navigation

00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
lights, no power.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's got black smoke
coming out of the back of it.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
People out there can even just
ask AI what this would all mean,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to find
out that this is perfectly

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
consistent with a
lithium ion battery fire

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that's got this dark smoke
coming out of the vents

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
from the air
conditioning system.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
That the glowing
orange is because

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.978 align:middle line:84%
of the bromine in the Halon
1301 fire extinguishing devices.

00:13:55.978 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It still
doesn't explain, Ashton--

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --why the pilot
didn't say something.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Why do we
assume they didn't?

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.197 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite things,

00:14:05.197 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
is that I think we have
proof they did say something.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They just classified
the communications.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Do we really think the last
communication was good night,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Malaysian Airlines flight
370 and then the plane

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
just disappeared?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: No way.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.268 align:middle line:84%
They classified
the communications.

00:14:20.268 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We know that, because the
Malaysian minister of defense

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:84%
in April, seven weeks after
the plane disappeared,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
he does this really
long interview.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:90%
He won't answer any questions.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But one thing he says is he says
the reason they didn't send up

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
jets to track the plane because
they knew it wasn't hostile.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
How did he know
it wasn't hostile?

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't know a plane is
not hostile from radar.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You could only know
it's not hostile

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because you had
communication with them.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And let me throw this out there.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We've got those coordinates,
Nicobar Islands.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
We've got Katherine Tee.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
She's within 100 miles
of those coordinates.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
There's a third source.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a China Times report
only reported in the China

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
times, that China intercepted
a communication between the US

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Navy and the Malaysian Airlines
flight 370 pilot at 1843 UTC,

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
which is 2:43 AM, within
five minutes of Katherine

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Tee's sighting of the plane
disintegrating and attempting

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%
an emergency landing.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the videos, you're

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:90%
seeing a plane flying low.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
We know because we see
cumulus clouds in the video.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
These are low altitude clouds.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So that plane is
flying low, and it's

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
descending and circling
in the video, which

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
would indicate they might be
trying to land in the ocean.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have three different
sources of corroboration,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the videos, Katherine
Tee's sighting,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and this China Times report that
the West never picked up on.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going with
that China Times report,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
which would indicate the plane
disappearing around 2:43 AM

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
or 1843 UTC, all of a sudden
the time just gets changed.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They say, nope, we didn't lose
contact with the plane at 1840.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.873 align:middle line:90%
It was actually at 1730 UTC.

00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
That was when we really
lost contact with the plane.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weren't there about
a dozen Chinese engineers

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:08.635 align:middle line:90%
on the plane?

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yap.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
There were 20
semiconductor engineers

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:90%
from Freescale Semiconductors.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
This company was very prominent.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They were connected to
US aerospace and defense.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.772 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
their books, they

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
had some sketchy stuff
going on in their books.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:84%
They were bought out by the
Carlyle Group and BlackRock

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:90%
around 2006, I believe it was.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:90%
But they bought them out--

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
the way they bought them
out saddled them with debt,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
like a $10 to $11
billion in debt.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So actually in around 2011, the
company was at its lowest point.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:90%
They had $7.6 billion in debt.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They were losing a
$1 billion per year.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they have this
restructuring happen.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2014, 20 of their
most important engineers

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:90%
disappear on this plane.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year,
the company gets sold off.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
All the equity holders,
they get bailed out.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
They would have
lost a lot of money.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:84%
Now they don't lose
any money anymore.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.757 align:middle line:84%
But that's not even the
most suspicious part.

00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:09.965 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most suspicious
part about the engineers

00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
is that we found a 2006 NSA,
National Security Agency,

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
report about the
commercial emergence

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:90%
of superconductive microchips.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And Freescale Semiconductors
is listed, I think,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.575 align:middle line:84%
nine times throughout
the report.

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And people
don't understand

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.817 align:middle line:84%
these superconductive
microchips--

00:17:26.817 --> 00:17:30.252 align:middle line:84%
like superconductivity is
zero resistance in a circuit.

00:17:30.252 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, especially
in the UFO community,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
have now been pushing this
idea that superconductivity

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of parallels to flying
saucers, levitation, et cetera.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So I just think that that
can't be a coincidence.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Plus the fact that in 2013,
Freescale Semiconductors

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
signed a contract to provide
US aerospace and defense

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:84%
with serving their
RF power needs.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly their radio
frequency power needs.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:90%
So the overall story to me--

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.865 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
different stories

00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that can make sense
given the evidence,

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.282 align:middle line:84%
but the one that makes
the most sense to me

00:18:04.282 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is that this was a planned
espionage event, maybe even

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:90%
counter espionage.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Like you could imagine these
engineers are going to China,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're never going
to come back from China.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And we knew about it.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we're not
going to let that happen.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
earliest theories I had

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is that they must have
some intellectual property

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
in their minds that is
related to the technology we

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.308 align:middle line:90%
get seen used on the plane.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could this have
been a message to China?

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stop doing
what you're doing.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And several people
speculated that.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first person,
I want to give credit

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.767 align:middle line:90%
to Joseph P. Farrell.

00:18:39.767 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Joseph P. Farrell has
written a lot of books

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:90%
about plasmas and UFOs.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Very intelligent guy.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Just days after the
plane disappeared,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:90%
he did an audio interview.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And he speculated that
about the engineers.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, it almost seems like
it would be somebody sending

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
a message to somebody else.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
He even speculated that
they might have teleported

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.342 align:middle line:90%
the plane, which is wild.

00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But then he said the only
reason why he didn't really

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:84%
stick with it is he
thought, well, there's

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.127 align:middle line:90%
easier ways to take them out.

00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Just shoot a rocket at it.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing
something so complicated?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:90%
But to your point, why?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a message.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a message to
our adversaries.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't steal our people.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't steal our technology.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine that you
are, Putin or Xi and now

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
a civilian airliner just
disappeared out of the sky.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You know that the United
States is responsible

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but the United States has all
the media, convincing the world

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, it was a
crazy pilot and he just

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.162 align:middle line:90%
somehow made the plane go dark.

00:19:37.162 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I would be absolutely
terrified if I

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
was one of the leaders of
our adversarial nations.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Because at any moment, we can
make their plane disappear out

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:90%
of the sky and--

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.848 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: --we can then
just convince the world

00:19:50.848 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that, Oh, it was
a clouds, weather,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.333 align:middle line:90%
it was a weather accident.

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everybody
forgets about it?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.708 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And everybody
forgets about it.

00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:59.913 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you think
leaked the videos and why?

00:19:59.913 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: I have identified
the leaker of the videos

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
as Lieutenant Commander
Edward C. Lin.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
In October of 2023,
I spent several weeks

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
after I had figured
out that I have

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
a good psychological
profile of the person that

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:90%
leaked the videos.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
They had to be a
military person.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The way the video was
recorded wasn't a camera.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So somebody had direct access
to both of those videos.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They had to be relatively
high ranked as well.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I started digging
through people.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.595 align:middle line:84%
There's these lists that
you can look through

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:84%
for people who are charged
with willful retention

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:84%
of classified
information, espionage.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to
Edward C. Lin, I

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:90%
The guy had checked every box.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
He flew on this super secret
spy plane program called

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:90%
the VPU-2 Wizards for the Navy.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Wizards, this
is the type of people

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that they take their badges off
when they are doing operations

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:90%
overseas.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Because they're
doing black operations.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't want
anybody to know who they are.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Exactly.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
If they get caught or whatever.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.807 align:middle line:84%
So he's already
checked that box.

00:21:02.807 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Turns out he has
signals intelligence.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I had found out that
signals intelligence were

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
how all these assets
are communicating

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
to the ground-based
computers as well.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:90%
We trusted him.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
He was the Congressional
liaison for the Navy.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually
the guy that they

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
would submit the black
budgets to the Congress

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.863 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and approve
them, to say, hey,

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
you need to approve these
billions of dollars.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.947 align:middle line:84%
We can't explain why, but
you need to just sign off.

00:21:24.947 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
He was that guy.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually exposed
to our black budgets

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.118 align:middle line:84%
and potentially secret
technology as well.

00:21:31.118 --> 00:21:32.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want
to look at a video

00:21:32.535 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And our
incredible production team

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
has split screen for both clips.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The videos are shot from
different angles, synced

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:90%
perfectly to the second one.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.915 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.668 align:middle line:10%
Look at this.

00:21:48.668 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking at, Ashton?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:10%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:10%
So these are the two videos.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Right off the bat, you
can tell that you're

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:10%
looking at real clouds here.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:10%
These are not
computer-generated clouds.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And the video on
the right, we can

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.663 align:middle line:10%
tell that we're actually looking
at somebody manually tracking

00:22:00.663 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:10%
the plane from the camera.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And we can see--

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is MH370?

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
You are looking at
MH370 being circled

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:90%
by three spheres of plasma.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.492 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: We can
tell they're plasma,

00:22:12.492 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
because look in the
thermal, it doesn't really

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:90%
look like a solid object.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:90%
It almost looks--

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's seen
on the left too.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the left,
look at how accurate

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
or how perfect the
movement of the orbs are.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.705 align:middle line:84%
Like they're in a
perfect triangle--

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perfect
synchronization.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.497 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Perfect
synchronization.

00:22:27.497 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And the heat signatures of
the orbs of the plasma orbs

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
is a clear sign that these
are a double-layered plasma.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They figured out how to separate
positive and negative charge

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and keep it separated in the
plasma, which what this does

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is it turns that ball of
plasma into a lightning bolt.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who captured
that video again?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.548 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: So that's the
United States military.

00:22:46.548 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:90%
So the one is this WAMI footage.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
they doing out there?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.453 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: They had to have
been planning that operation.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:53.623 align:middle line:84%
And this is where people
say, Ashton, you're

00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
saying it's a fire
event, but now you're

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
saying these orbs are
teleporting the plane?

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.092 align:middle line:90%
And I'm saying it's both.

00:22:59.092 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And to me there's only
two possibilities.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:90%
One, the fire was accidental.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they deployed these
orbs because there's

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.228 align:middle line:84%
VIPs on the plane, or they were
trying to save it, or something.

00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:09.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at it again, Ashton.

00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at it one more time.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.163 align:middle line:10%
>>FORBES: And again, we can
tell that the clouds are low.

00:23:16.163 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:10%
You can see the smoke coming
out of the back of the plane.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:10%
That cannot be contrails,
because this plane is flying

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:10%
low.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:10%
So that actually
has to be smoke.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:10%
And the smoke is circulating
throughout the cabin

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:10%
of the plane and then pumping it
out through the air conditioning

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.498 align:middle line:10%
exhaust ports
underneath the plane.

00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you
think at this point there's

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with the plane?

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Oh, yeah.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I think this plane is doomed.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.062 align:middle line:84%
I think that if this
plane hits the water,

00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
it's going to break
into a million pieces

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is
going to be doomed.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.945 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for the
people out there,

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
give hope to anybody.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that even in this
scenario, unfortunately,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I think all the passengers,
unfortunately, did not make it.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Look at the orbs.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Look at the dark lines
in front of the orbs.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.543 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge, huge tell.

00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at that.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.335 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: The dark lines
in front of the orbs

00:24:02.335 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
are gravity propulsion.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They're actually changing
space time in front of them

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to make a geodesic path,
like a gravitational path

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:90%
that they follow.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.056 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the plane looks
like it was under control.

00:24:13.056 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Oh, yeah.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.795 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is controlling
that plane there.

00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is they're

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
creating a field around it.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And the equilibrium point, the
zero point between the orbs

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:90%
is where the plane's at.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a dead zone
in the magnetic field.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So what that does
is that's like--

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:84%
just like a warp
drive, the safe point

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:90%
is the point in the middle.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.288 align:middle line:90%
And you make a bubble around it.

00:24:35.288 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
those orbs are doing.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.363 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm so convinced
that it's not annihilation

00:24:39.363 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:84%
that those orbs are
doing in that plane,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
teleporting it somewhere else.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
wasn't added in later?

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.595 align:middle line:84%
There's no artificial
intelligence here?

00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Well, I'm not
going to go that far.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But I will say
that I think there

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
might be artificial
intelligence at play there.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.543 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not saying
nobody edited that.

00:24:55.543 --> 00:24:56.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's not doctored?

00:24:56.835 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: No, it's not doctored.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people will think that
they doctored it in the zap

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.303 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy for people to believe
whatever they want to believe.

00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But look at it from
this perspective.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The only person that could have
made that video, would have

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
all the knowledge required, is
going to be the United States

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%
military or intelligence.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the two
screens, which video

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
do you think was the
most incriminating?

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: From-- this
is a great question.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:84%
From an investigation
standpoint,

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:84%
the satellite video is more
incriminating because it

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
has the coordinates in there.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It really tells us exactly
where that plane is.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you just draw a straight
line from the last radar plot,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you get right to
those coordinates.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Like it's that simple.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
That to me is enough proof that
if we were in a court of law,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
like you people have got
to do some explaining.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.028 align:middle line:84%
But the thermal video,
the drone video, that's

00:25:41.028 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
the one they didn't want
China and Russia to see.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the one they
didn't want me to see.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the one
where we can figure out

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.332 align:middle line:84%
the exact nature of this
physics and how it's possible.

00:25:50.332 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think it connects
to the UFO stuff.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ashton, explain to us
what these 239 people aboard

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.025 align:middle line:84%
the plane, which includes
12 crew members--

00:25:59.025 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what's going on
in the plane at that time?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: So this
plane had been on fire

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
for over an hour after
that plane had gone dark,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
from the point we see it in
the coordinates in the video.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say fire, are we

00:26:12.883 --> 00:26:14.768 align:middle line:84%
talking about a little
smoke in the cabin?

00:26:14.768 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: We're talking about--

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere in
the luggage area, where?

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Fire that's
contained within the cargo bay.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're not talking about
the plane itself is on fire.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
localized fire in the cargo bay

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
with the lithium ion batteries
that were stacked up there.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very
predictable burn rate.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Lithium ion batteries do.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 40 minutes
into the flight?

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: 40 minutes
into the flight.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Presumably, those
batteries either ignited,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
or they were igniting
right before that.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:84%
That's when the pilot, plane
goes dark, turns around.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.305 align:middle line:84%
Now, they would been
battling the fire.

00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:48.472 align:middle line:84%
They would have had-- the
automatic fire suppression

00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:49.760 align:middle line:90%
devices would have deployed.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The pilot would have probably
deployed the manual fire

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:90%
suppression devices.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
they're just trying

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to keep the plane intact
as long as possible.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
he have radioed

00:26:57.285 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to somebody, I got a
fire on board this plane,

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I got a problem?

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: They
almost certainly did.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the question is, how
come we haven't been made aware

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:90%
of those?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
is pretty clear.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:84%
If they released any
communication that said,

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
we've got a fire on board this
plane, what's the first question

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:90%
everyone is going to ask?

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.315 align:middle line:90%
Where's the plane?

00:27:15.315 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's the plane?

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And what are the orbs?

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:90%
What are the orbs?

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Yeah,
what are the orbs?

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:90%
The orbs are balls of plasma.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
They are double
layer balls of plasma

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that are charge separated, just
like a battery or a capacitor.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
shot out at the plane?

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: We can't tell
exactly where they came from,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.003 align:middle line:84%
but it could come from a
satellite, a plane, a submarine.

00:27:35.003 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The second drone looks like
it comes from the water.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
their purpose?

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And so their
purpose can be many purposes.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, I think
they're teleporting the plane.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But this technology can
have tons of purposes.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:84%
They could just
be mapping things.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You can use this technology
to map the entire building

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, for
example, from the outside.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So it could be used just
for monitoring things.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You could be using things
to annihilate something.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that this technology
is the perfect defense

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
against a hypersonic missile.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Hypersonic missiles are no
threat to the United States.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
We can teleport a nuke
back into the Kremlin.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We can detonate a
nuke from outer space

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
within five seconds of
the ICBM taking off.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:90%
So what are these orbs?

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
These orbs are the most secret
superweapon in the United States

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:90%
arsenal.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the biggest
leak of intelligence

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.228 align:middle line:84%
ever in the history
of the United States.

00:28:21.228 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing we need
to know about the orbs

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:84%
is they're not just something
that teleports planes.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The moment you see a
coherent ball of plasma,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
where we've figured out
how to stabilize plasma,

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:90%
you've cracked fusion.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:90%
They've cracked fusion.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point,
Ashton, did the plane disappear

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:90%
in a flash of light.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.267 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Two hours into the flight.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:84%
One hour 20 minutes
after the plane

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
went dark in the
Nicobar Islands,

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that's the point
where these orbs are

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:90%
appearing around the plane.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the flash of light?

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: The flash of light,
that's another great question.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is that these orbs

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
are converging on
one another, and they

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:90%
are producing negative energy.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Negative energy is
the thing that physics

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
says we need to produce a
warp drive or a wormhole.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The way they're doing
this is imagine each orb

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is an atom, a
hydrogen atom, which

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
has a positively charged
center and a negatively charged

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:90%
electron around it.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
What these orbs are
doing is they're reducing

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.268 align:middle line:90%
the ground state of the atom.

00:29:20.268 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So the ground state
of the atom would

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:84%
say the electron volt
is minus 13.6 EVs.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:84%
What these are doing is
they're reducing it further.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're going from
minus 13.6 to say minus 20.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And what this does is
there's an energy difference.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:90%
That's negative energy release.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And what it's releasing in the
videos is ultraviolet light.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.143 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that cold fusion?

00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: No, that's not
directly cold fusion.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's huge because
ultraviolet light, this is--

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
so when this negative
energy happens,

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
we see this ultraviolet
release flash.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in the satellite
video we see the flash.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But in the drone
video, it's black.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's cold because
ultraviolet light does not

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
show up in a thermal camera.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it's all black.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So from a fusion perspective,
to answer that question,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:84%
the reason why we've
never solved fusion

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:84%
is because we
discounted gravity.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.987 align:middle line:84%
We looked up at the
sun and we said, well,

00:30:12.987 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:84%
the sun is producing
fusion through gravity,

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
but we can't manipulate gravity.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So instead, let's just
make it really hot.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.987 align:middle line:90%
Let's just make it really hot.

00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the way to do it.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if I make this
ball of plasma really hot,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just randomly hoping my ions
come together to create fusion.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just a random chance.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what you want to do is
you want to use gravity and say,

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:84%
force the ions to come together,
force their paths to intersect.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why gravity is
the solution to fusion.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:90%
That's why cold fusion is not--

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:84%
like what Pons and
Fleischmann did,

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:84%
cold fusion is the
idea that we just

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
don't need to achieve
fusion through temperature.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:90%
We can achieve it other ways.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And the last thought then
is those balls of plasma

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that we were looking at in
that video, they're blue

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
of green on them.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are they?

00:30:58.743 --> 00:31:00.245 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: About 20
feet in diameter.

00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:01.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Each?

00:31:01.045 --> 00:31:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Each.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:90%
So they are--

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: They are big.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Big.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And those balls of
plasma, they are

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:90%
cold non-equilibrium plasmas.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So the temperature is
the same as the air.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
a look at the slowed down

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:84%
version of the video showing
the fusion signature.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: OK.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell us
what we're looking at.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So here you see the
green part of the orb.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly blue, but you
see this green or yellow heat

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:90%
signature in there.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing there
is that's the electrons,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the negatively charged
part of the orb.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's being pulled
towards the magnetic field

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that the plasma
orbs are creating.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So the orbs are spinning
around the plane,

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're creating this
magnetic field around the plane.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
pulls that heat signature

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:90%
towards the magnetic field.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when I actually looked
into the science of this,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I found that if this is correct,
when each plasma orb gets

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to the front of the
plane, its heat signature

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.520 align:middle line:84%
should be parallel to
the axis of the plane.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that heat
signature always either faces

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
left or to the right when
in front of the plane, which

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
indicates that the reason
why we see that signature

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
magnetic field.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So before the orb starts
spinning around the plane,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:84%
there in like glow
mode, which would

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
mean that you can
see the negatively

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
charged sphere of electrons
around the entire ball.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:90%
So it looks yellow.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But once the orb starts
spinning around the plane,

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that yellow part
moves, and it gets

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.090 align:middle line:84%
stuck on one side or
the other of the orb

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.250 align:middle line:90%
depending on the magnetic field.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So everything we're seeing
in there is just physics.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These orbs,
Ashton, are putting off

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:90%
some dark trails behind it.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.852 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: So those dark
trails are actually

00:32:49.852 --> 00:32:50.760 align:middle line:90%
not behind the orbs.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They're in front of the orbs.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So those dark trails, I
would call that warp drive.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.135 align:middle line:84%
Warp drive does not
have to be superluminal.

00:32:59.135 --> 00:32:59.935 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:32:59.935 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
in front, not behind?

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: In front.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
the video to demonstrate that.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable
that you spotted that.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: And this is the thing
I think is going to be the first

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
thing that gets confirmed
from the UFO community,

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we're
going to see this--

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I call it endothermic
propulsion.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.190 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling
energy out of space.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's cold and black.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is
that's their future path.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:84%
They're following
that path forward.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So I presume this is
some kind of laser

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're projecting out in
front of them that pulls energy

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:84%
from the environment,
somehow contracts space time,

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to fall
through that path.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's
controlling the orbs?

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: That's the AI part.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no way humans are
controlling those orbs.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:90%
It's too perfect.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Like the way they're
spinning around it,

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.487 align:middle line:84%
the military must
have some AI that's

00:33:46.487 --> 00:33:47.820 align:middle line:90%
more advanced than what we have.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because those videos
are from 2014,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think OpenAI
didn't start until 2015.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the orbs
had hit the plane,

00:33:54.715 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:90%
would anything have happened?

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.088 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Well, that's
what happens at the end.

00:33:58.088 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So at the end what
happens is the orbs,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:84%
they have some kind of mechanism
to control the configuration.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine that
each orb has its spin.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Its magnetic field is either
up, down, left, or right.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.306 align:middle line:84%
And all three orbs are going
to have a configuration.

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
right before they end

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is they change
the configuration.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
orbs blur for a second.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And then right after
that, they converge.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they physical,
or they were just lights?

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: They're physical.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:90%
This is another great question.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:90%
You've got a lot of good ones.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people think
that they read those Forbes

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:84%
articles in 2020 that said, oh,
we've got these plasma balls,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
but they're like
illusions or holograms.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:90%
These are real physical objects.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think you
can see them though,

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
because the ultraviolet
light they release,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
invisible to the human
eye, which would also

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
mean if you can
even see the orbs,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
it might just look
like a blur in the sky.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point
into the 40 minute

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.315 align:middle line:90%
flight did these orbs pop up?

00:34:53.315 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: So 40
minutes into the plane,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe the orbs popped
up when the plane went dark.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people tried
to speculate, oh, well,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the plane went
dark 40 minutes in.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's when
the orbs got there.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.807 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
the coordinates say.

00:35:03.807 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The coordinates are in a
completely different location.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I'm saying that
the plane goes dark because

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of the fire, turns around,
goes to the nearest airport,

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:90%
but can't land there.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Probably because--

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're 40 minutes out.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: So yeah.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So 40 minutes to get to the
point where they go dark

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.085 align:middle line:90%
and then another 40 minutes--

00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get back

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: --to
get to the airport

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
where they're going to try to
land, and they don't land there.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.678 align:middle line:90%
But we know they tried.

00:35:26.678 --> 00:35:27.478 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:27.478 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the
co-pilot's cell phone

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:84%
pinged a cell tower,
which means that someone

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:84%
had to be trying to connect to
the ground with a cell phone.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.173 align:middle line:84%
They were probably trying
to say, we can't land.

00:35:36.173 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:90%
We can't see anything.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
We have no power.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.073 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they think
they were under attack?

00:35:40.073 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: I don't
think the people

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.073 align:middle line:84%
on the plane could
have seen the orbs.

00:35:43.073 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not for sure about
that, but I doubt it.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
My guess is the people were
extremely confused on the plane.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine your plane
starts on fire out of nowhere.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You're now in an
emergency scenario.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
masks coming down.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I think
happened there then

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is that after the
plane couldn't land,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the US Navy came over,
probably encrypted

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
communications, and said,
here's the rendezvous point.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going to save you.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Come to this point.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.645 align:middle line:84%
And you could have said anything
to them at that point because--

00:36:12.645 --> 00:36:13.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they would have--

00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Exactly.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And the rendezvous
point is where

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:90%
we see the plane in the videos.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason,
people say, well,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:90%
why did they choose that point?

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:84%
My guess is because the South
China Sea is too close to China,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and China has surveillance
apparatus there.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So the idea would be move
it away from China, teleport

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.040 align:middle line:84%
the plane, and then nobody
knows where the plane went.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
this is all about China?

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: I think that
behind the scenes,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:84%
there is absolutely a shadow
arms race over this UFO

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.070 align:middle line:84%
technology potentially between
China, Russia, and the United

States.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.453 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what this is really

00:36:48.453 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
about, is that this is really
the United States pushing back

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:84%
at China and Russia in
2014, saying we figured out

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:90%
the secret UFO technology.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We've advanced it to the point
where we can teleport stuff.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to mess with
us, you will be annihilated.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How dangerous
is the technology?

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Extremely dangerous.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the thing I
thought about the most

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:84%
before this interview today
is how dangerous this is

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and how fast this is
starting to come out.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.555 align:middle line:84%
I actually thought this would
take like 10 to 20 more years

00:37:17.555 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:84%
before people start to
accept that this stuff could

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.810 align:middle line:84%
be possible, and it's happening
much quicker than that.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm scared
because as somebody

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.770 align:middle line:84%
who understands the physics, you
look at that plane disappearing.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And from a conventional
standpoint,

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:84%
it should take this
amount of energy

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that's equivalent to the size
of Jupiter to cause that event.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet we see it with just this
little blip, and it's just gone.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:84%
That indicates that
somebody has figured out

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.950 align:middle line:90%
the secret to free energy.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
They've figured out some way
to cheat the laws of physics

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to pull energy out of what
we would think of as nowhere,

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
or to reduce the
amount of energy that

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:84%
would be required for
this teleportation event

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:90%
that we think we need.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And if that's possible,
then the sky's the limit.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Like if you have
free energy, why can

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:90%
you not produce a black hole.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of engineering it.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you think
these orbs were launched from?

00:38:08.277 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the second one
came from a submarine,

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because you can actually see the
second orb come from the water

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:90%
and shoot up towards the plane.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The first two seem to
come from the side.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So again, satellite
seems possible,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
but airplane also
seems possible.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I imagine they have some
kind of cannon that can

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:90%
shoot like a plasma orb at it.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have
come from the plane that

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.327 align:middle line:90%
shot the videos?

00:38:30.327 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Absolutely could have.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And it could have come from
the drone that was shooting.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.842 align:middle line:90%
It could have come from--

00:38:35.842 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I think Edward C. Lin
was on the spy plane

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.925 align:middle line:90%
that night staring at the plane.

00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
further evidence

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
of this in the
Netflix documentary.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The French father, Wattrelos,
I believe his last name

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is, he was told by an
intelligence source

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Americans know exactly
what happened to the plane.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were two AWACS
spy planes in the area.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those two AWACS could
have been Edward C. Lin's VPU-2

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Wizards plane and the drone.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Those could have been it.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, those would
have been detected on radar.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
planes in the sky.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.105 align:middle line:84%
So again, it goes to
show that how are we

00:39:11.105 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
pretending like
the United States

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what happened to
this, the amount of stuff coming

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
ask me like, what

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
does China, what does
Russia think about this,

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:84%
they also pointed the
finger at the United States.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
There's this Russian
GRU report that

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:84%
was considered
disinformation that asked why

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:90%
the US Navy abducted the plane.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And China was hacking
the Malaysian government

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:90%
the next day.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.422 align:middle line:84%
They hacked the Malaysian
government the next day

00:39:33.422 --> 00:39:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and stole crisis
media minute notes

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and classified information.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Why was China hacking
the Malaysian government?

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, because they knew
something wasn't right.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
They knew somebody
took the plane.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.800 align:middle line:84%
They knew the plane
didn't just disappear,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.842 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
figure out what happened.

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Last thought.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Witro
from Twitter came up

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
with this theory, that
what if Edward Lin recorded

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.730 align:middle line:84%
it and he wasn't supposed
to have recorded it?

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And then China hacked him
and they got the video

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and then they just released
it on the internet somewhere.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I feel
like it played out,

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.010 align:middle line:84%
because Edward Lin, everything
about him screams patriot.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And the government came
down super hard on him.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.453 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: But they also
kind of forgave him.

00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Like if it was anybody else,
they would have been in a hole

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:84%
He got six years
and then now he's

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.460 align:middle line:84%
allowed to live a
normal life again.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was
an indirect leak.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he meant
harm when he did it.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he leaked the
most important videos ever.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing on Edward Lin
is that recently, we found out

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:90%
that he changed his name.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Somebody found a YouTube video.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
he change his name?

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Indeed.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you find out
when he changed his name,

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you would think, oh, well,
he got out of prison.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he changed his name
after he got out of prison

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.317 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't want to be
associated to this whole thing.

00:40:49.317 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
No, he didn't change his name
right after he got prison.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
He changed his name two
months after I started

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:90%
saying he leaked the video.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After you started?

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: December of 2023--

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.980 align:middle line:84%
December 29th, 2023, he puts in
the paperwork to have his name

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:90%
changed to Edward James Soraya.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your opinion--

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yeah.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --where is MH370?

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: My guess is
that they flew that plane

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:84%
to Diego Garcia, which
is the only place you

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.720 align:middle line:90%
could hide a Boeing 777.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no commercial airports
you can hide a Boeing 777.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You land at a
commercial airport,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.400 align:middle line:90%
you're going to find that plane.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So it had to either be
somewhere in the water

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
about, a different area,

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:33.020 align:middle line:84%
because we found nothing in the
South Indian Ocean for 11 years.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Or they took it
apart, they put it

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in Diego Garcia and maybe
an underground hangar,

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and they tore it apart.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they threw some pieces--

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
the passengers?

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Those I think that--

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any good
news on that front.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that the fire
event most likely

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.588 align:middle line:84%
took everybody out because
of the time period.

00:41:49.588 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's an hour
and 20 minutes from the plane

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
going dark, starting on
fire, to the plane being

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:90%
zapped by the orbs.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
rubble that was found off

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.280 align:middle line:90%
of the coast of Africa?

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: The debris?

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.597 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing
about the debris.

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:01.193 align:middle line:90%
I think that is from MH370.

00:42:01.193 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
What people don't
realize is that debris

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
is physically, impossibly, to
far away from the search area.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you can even
look at the CSIRO.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.060 align:middle line:84%
They did debris drift
test in Australia.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.530 align:middle line:84%
No piece of debris drifted more
than two kilometers per day

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:90%
on any of their tests.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:84%
They need the debris to drift
seven kilometers per day

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:84%
on average to get to Africa,
three and a half times faster

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:84%
than what their own
physical tests showed.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
that debris comes--

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the drift analysis,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
the ocean currents flow to the
east, where they're searching.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.270 align:middle line:84%
The debris should
have washed ashore

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.700 align:middle line:90%
in Australia, not in Africa.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Either that debris
is from MH370.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.378 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, those
satellite pings

00:42:47.378 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that we did and we
searched in South Indian

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.267 align:middle line:90%
Ocean have to be fake.

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:90%
They're just too far away.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible,
is it conceivable,

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:58.987 align:middle line:84%
that this plane went through
a wormhole and disappeared?

00:42:58.987 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: That's exactly
what I'm saying happened.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I think the plane went
through a wormhole.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.823 align:middle line:90%
I think we created the wormhole.

00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it went
to the Andromeda galaxy.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
went to the moon.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The cell phones were
still ringing days later.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.900 align:middle line:84%
There was other indicators,
like people seeing the plane

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.400 align:middle line:84%
in the early morning hours,
flying towards Diego Garcia.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.700 align:middle line:84%
That would indicate this plane
was still on Earth somewhere.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So my theory is this plane
was teleported to the West

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.420 align:middle line:84%
from the Nicobar Islands
towards the Maldives.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, there's a
few hour time gap we don't know.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Did it land?

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Was there a time
dilation effect?

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it flies
south to Diego Garcia,

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and it gets seen by about 15
islanders on a small island,

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.950 align:middle line:84%
see this giant jumbo jet
with steam coming out

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the back of it flying
towards Diego Garcia.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So you either believe that
that debris is accurate,

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.005 align:middle line:90%
if the debris is real.

00:43:54.005 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
It's funny if you look
at the ocean currents,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:84%
a much better location for that
debris to have drifted from

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:90%
is Diego Garcia military base.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect match
for all that debris.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.983 align:middle line:84%
Or that debris is fake and
the satellite pings are real.

00:44:07.983 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
ask yourself, well,

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:84%
we've been searching for 11
years in the South Indian Ocean.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We never found one piece
of debris down there.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.690 align:middle line:90%
No black boxes, nothing,

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Nothing.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And people try to say, oh,
well, it's really deep.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.705 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say the
ocean is really big.

00:44:19.705 --> 00:44:21.985 align:middle line:84%
Well, are the satellite
pings a legit or not?

00:44:21.985 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:84%
If the satellite
pings are legit,

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we should know
where the plane is.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if they
stopped looking for it?

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: They were actually
just recently searching again.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is funny
because I told people,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.102 align:middle line:84%
they're going to search again,
they're going to find nothing.

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
There are two different
vessels, Armada 7808,

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I think is what-- or 7806.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
Chinese vessel that

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.030 align:middle line:84%
was just searching
in that one pit

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that the guy said, oh, the
guy landed in this secret pit,

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.420 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.870 align:middle line:90%
The China vessel's there.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, neither of
them have found anything

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.275 align:middle line:84%
because none neither of them
have made any announcements.

00:44:49.275 --> 00:44:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So they're also planning on
searching again in November.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And my official stance is
search as much as you want.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.785 align:middle line:90%
I'm extremely confident--

00:44:56.785 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
going to find it

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're never
going to find anything.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Keep searching until you can
come to terms with the fact

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:90%
that it ain't down there.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great researcher
Harold Puthoff explained physics

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:06.850 align:middle line:90%
behind the orb.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FORBES: Yap.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us what he said.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FORBES: Harold
Puthoff is possibly

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.232 align:middle line:84%
the final boss of zero
point energy disclosure.

00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:15.440 align:middle line:84%
He's the world's leading
expert on zero point energy.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:84%
He comes from a background
of remote viewing

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, which I
think is interesting.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Harold Puthoff says that we are
in an equilibrium of energy,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and that we're not at the
ground state of energy.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.207 align:middle line:90%
We're in an equilibrium.

00:45:26.207 --> 00:45:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't
feel it because it's

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.330 align:middle line:90%
like being in a bathtub.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.240 align:middle line:84%
When the bathtub temperature
equalizes with your body,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't seem warm anymore.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Same exact idea.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But he says this
energy is so dense

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that even just a coffee
cup of empty space

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:84%
has enough energy in it to
vaporize all the Earth's oceans,

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.530 align:middle line:90%
all the Earth's oceans.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's also
written what I think

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:84%
is going to be in the
future a Nobel Prize winning

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.250 align:middle line:84%
paper about space time
metric engineering,

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:01.750 align:middle line:84%
which explains that when we are
doing this gravity manipulation,

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not actually physically
changing the mass of the object.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not manipulating
the mass of the object.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.882 align:middle line:90%
It's different than that.

00:46:08.882 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what I do is I make
a bubble around the object,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and I manipulate
the bubble itself.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And if you manipulate
the bubble,

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:10%
manipulate the space
time, you can basically

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.917 align:middle line:10%
create an optical
illusion where it

00:46:19.917 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:10%
looks like the object is moving
faster than the speed of light

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:10%
to anyone who's looking at it.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.580 align:middle line:84%
From the object's
perspective, the object

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.402 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's moving
at a normal speed.

00:46:28.402 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But from our
perspective, it's not.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So what Harold Puthoff
shows is that the big thing

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:90%
about Einstein was relativity.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:84%
That we're all always in our
own little bubble all the time,

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and it just seems like we're
interacting in real time

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.050 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
on the same planet.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you start to mess
around with the gravity,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.650 align:middle line:84%
you start to get these really
bizarre effects, which include

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:90%
faster than light travel.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.843 align:middle line:84%
