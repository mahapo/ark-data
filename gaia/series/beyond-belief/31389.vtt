Look, we're laughing and
smiling now, but by the end

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:50.183 align:middle line:84%
of this program I
guarantee you we won't be.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.319 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of the most
frightening things I've ever

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.491 align:middle line:84%
dealt with on this program --
EMPs -- electromagnetic pulses.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.692 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:01.561 align:middle line:84%
A detonation by a nuke,
high above our atmosphere;

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.398 align:middle line:84%
a coronal mass ejection;
an X-flare from the sun

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.068 align:middle line:84%
which literally wipes
out our grid

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.903 align:middle line:90%
and everything else with it.

Our special guest
tonight, William Forstchen,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.209 align:middle line:84%
author of  One Second After,
a critically acclaimed book

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.945 align:middle line:84%
that Congress should
be reading every day.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.147 align:middle line:90%
William, welcome [applause].

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:24.618 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with us.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:25.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks a lot.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a seat.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:30.089 align:middle line:84%
You are pretty gutsy,
my friend, coming...

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.226 align:middle line:84%
>> ...up with a book like
this and a subject matter

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:38.431 align:middle line:84%
that so many people just
simply don't want to listen to.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.232 align:middle line:90%
It scares them to hear this.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain, first of
all, for everybody;

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.105 align:middle line:90%
EMP, what does that mean?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
>> EMP, shorthand for
electromagnetic pulse.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:53.345 align:middle line:84%
It is a by-product of
detonating a nuclear weapon.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The perfect storm scenario
for enemies is to pop one

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.422 align:middle line:84%
to three nukes approximately
250 miles above the atmosphere.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:06.493 align:middle line:84%
In that first microsecond
of detonation,

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.295 align:middle line:90%
the gamma ray burst coming off

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.298 align:middle line:84%
of the bomb hits the
upper atmosphere,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.834 align:middle line:84%
triggers an electrostatic
discharge that cascades

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
down to the earth's surface.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.605 align:middle line:90%
One second after, it could take

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.241 align:middle line:84%
out the entire power grid
of the United States.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like that.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Like that.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.412 align:middle line:84%
And Congressional
testimony back in '04,

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.015 align:middle line:84%
which I base my book upon,
one expert said it would be

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.318 align:middle line:84%
like throwing America
back a hundred years.

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:34.588 align:middle line:84%
I disagree because people a
hundred years ago knew how

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.756 align:middle line:84%
to live with the technology
of a hundred years ago.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.693 align:middle line:84%
>> This would throw us
back a thousand years,

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.395 align:middle line:84%
and the estimated
fatality rate for America,

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:45.131 align:middle line:90%
90% by the end of one year.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.499 align:middle line:90%
>> 90%.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.501 align:middle line:84%
>> 90% will perish
in the first year.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Not that the pulse and the
explosion would physically kill

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.474 align:middle line:90%
people, it's afterward.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.443 align:middle line:84%
It's with the grid down
and everything else.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.645 align:middle line:84%
>> The only people that
would be directly affected

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:02.048 align:middle line:84%
in the first couple of minutes,
and I think about this flying

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.316 align:middle line:90%
out here to meet with you...

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.685 align:middle line:84%
>> ...is walking to that
plane, look at that,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:84%
what they call mal
glass cockpit...

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.021 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Remember Sully?

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.959 align:middle line:84%
>> He lost his -- but he
still had his hydraulics

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.762 align:middle line:84%
and his computer so he was able
to put that plane down safely.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you lose
all the controls

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
in a modern airplane you can
jam the stick all you want...

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.902 align:middle line:84%
>> And you want --
every plane that's

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.169 align:middle line:90%
in the air at that time...

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Going to go straight down.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.105 align:middle line:90%
>> ...they all go down.

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:28.074 align:middle line:84%
>> It will make 911
look like a...

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:28.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Small.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.377 align:middle line:90%
>> ...small in comparison.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.613 align:middle line:84%
>> An X-flare from
the sun, a big one.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:36.249 align:middle line:84%
If the sun and the
earth are directly

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
in front of each other...

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.352 align:middle line:90%
>> ...so that path is perfect.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.454 align:middle line:90%
>> That could do the same thing.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, and it's
happening all the time, George.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.726 align:middle line:84%
You and I have chatted a couple
of times before on your show.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.094 align:middle line:90%
Remember about a year ago...

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:48.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:50.263 align:middle line:90%
>> ...the sun popped one.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:84%
Now the sun all of the time is
throwing out what's called CMEs.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.403 align:middle line:84%
That stands for coronal
mass ejection.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
They're flaring out all
the time, but the earth is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.875 align:middle line:90%
like a tiny little marble...

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:02.442 align:middle line:90%
>> It's -- yeah.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:90%
>> ...three...

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.477 align:middle line:90%
>> ...it's a moving target.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. But that --
approximately once every hundred

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:11.551 align:middle line:84%
to 150 years one of those
CMEs slams straight into us,

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:15.622 align:middle line:84%
disrupts the magnetosphere and
can create a global shutdown

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.124 align:middle line:84%
of the entire electrical
grid of the world.

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Did that not happen on this
planet once before during the

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.296 align:middle line:90%
era of the telegraph?

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, 1859.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:84%
And I would urge listeners
who might be doubting this

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
or the folks in the
audience thinking, boy,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:84%
George has an interesting
guest here,

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.208 align:middle line:84%
look up the Carrington
Event when you get

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.276 align:middle line:90%
on the computer later.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.312 align:middle line:84%
Carrington Event --
it happened in 1859.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It hit with such intensity,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.317 align:middle line:84%
telegraphy wires were
melting off of the poles...

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.087 align:middle line:84%
>> ...the railroad ties
were catching on fire.

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.223 align:middle line:84%
Now think of how overbuilt
that technology was...

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.126 align:middle line:84%
>> ...compared to the
microelectronics we're

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.396 align:middle line:90%
so dependent upon today.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about this,
William, in two facets:

00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:00.233 align:middle line:84%
one is the nuke;
the other's the sun.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Both, as we just said,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.906 align:middle line:84%
incredible dangers
to us, to our planet.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.441 align:middle line:84%
We're concerned about
North Korea.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.542 align:middle line:90%
>> We should be.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.544 align:middle line:84%
>> We're concerned about
Iran getting nukes.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:12.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.914 align:middle line:90%
>> We question the ability

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:18.618 align:middle line:84%
to reach the continental
United States with missiles.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
worry about that.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
put a nuke on a ship,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.962 align:middle line:84%
launch it above the
atmosphere, and detonate it,

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
and we create this
horrible scenario.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> George, the analogy
I give there is

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.135 align:middle line:90%
if I was coming home every day

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.138 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hearing a neighbor
shouting how he's going

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:41.507 align:middle line:84%
to get me, and I peek over the
fence and he's target practicing

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.675 align:middle line:90%
on a picture of my face...

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:43.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.878 align:middle line:84%
>> ...I think I better
start running.

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:46.012 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that's
funny if he's doing that.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> No. Or he's going
to say that he's going

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.215 align:middle line:84%
to bathe my child
in nuclear death.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.685 align:middle line:84%
>> The Iranians for years,
out in the Caspian Sea,

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:57.156 align:middle line:84%
had them launching missiles
straight up and detonating them

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.426 align:middle line:84%
and then claiming, oh,
it was a failed test.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.595 align:middle line:84%
That fits the profile
of how to launch an EMP.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.632 align:middle line:90%
Get a cargo container ship.

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:06.866 align:middle line:84%
Folks might recall
-- remember a couple

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.902 align:middle line:84%
of years ago a cargo
container ship from Russia...

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:09.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle line:90%
>> ...got lost for...

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:10.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:11.571 align:middle line:90%
>> ...two weeks?

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know where
the heck it was.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:12.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:14.007 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know where it was.

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:15.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Parked it in the
Gulf of Mexico, fire --

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.744 align:middle line:84%
by the way, we don't have any
air defense systems along the

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.179 align:middle line:90%
Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.216 align:middle line:84%
We'd have less than five
minutes to react, then it's up.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> How would we even
know who the culprit was?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.055 align:middle line:90%
>> There's another major point.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.925 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
like December 7th, 1941,

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:33.426 align:middle line:84%
where our guys are
looking up and going,

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.794 align:middle line:84%
"There's meatballs
on those planes.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:90%
It's the Japanese."

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.265 align:middle line:84%
Or even on 911 where
we had the profile

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.233 align:middle line:90%
within a matter of hours...

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:40.934 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.268 align:middle line:90%
>> ...this is al-Queda.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.838 align:middle line:84%
The cargo ship launches and
then it blows up and sinks?

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:45.839 align:middle line:90%
These weapons...

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.706 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're gone.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> ...could have
been handed off?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Who do we know has done it?

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.678 align:middle line:90%
But it's a first-strike weapon.

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.079 align:middle line:90%
That's the key thing.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.649 align:middle line:84%
It can take America down as a
major power player, cripple us,

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.018 align:middle line:84%
and 90% of Americans
are dead a year later,

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.553 align:middle line:84%
and we might not even
know where it came from.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:01.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Yet -- that's right.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:90%
We cannot retaliate.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:06.326 align:middle line:84%
We cannot, for example,
our subs, our nuclear subs

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:09.128 align:middle line:84%
that have missiles on them
-- how do you detonate?

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.763 align:middle line:84%
How do you launch
when you don't know

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.532 align:middle line:90%
who you're launching against?

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:13.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.834 align:middle line:90%
And the North Korean profile --

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.871 align:middle line:84%
the combination between
North Korea and Iran

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:84%
with terrorist cells,
with the potential

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of Nukes having disappeared
out of Russia in the last 10

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.679 align:middle line:84%
to 15 years, that is
a deadly combination.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle line:84%
I am appalled with a policy that
allows North Korea to threaten

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.654 align:middle line:84%
and to launch -- the
moment that missile crosses

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
into international
airspace, take it out.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.661 align:middle line:90%
And this is not just idle talk.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.298 align:middle line:84%
It's not rhetoric when
someone, as you just mentioned,

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:49.636 align:middle line:84%
threatens your very
existence, creates videos

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.271 align:middle line:90%
of your cities burning...

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:52.338 align:middle line:90%
>> ...in flames...

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:84%
>> ...you know, you've got
to take that seriously.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:84%
And I really wonder what
someone like Putin would do

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.782 align:middle line:84%
if the North Koreans
threatened Russia.

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.418 align:middle line:84%
I think the guy would
have launched by now.

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:09.589 align:middle line:84%
There are some nations out there
that just won't fool around,

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:13.026 align:middle line:84%
yet we seem to -- look,
I spent nine years

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:14.694 align:middle line:84%
as you know, William,
in the Navy.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.763 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a warmonger
by any means.

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:18.398 align:middle line:90%
I hate war.

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:90%
But you have to defend yourself.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.137 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a great
defense is supposed to do.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:28.107 align:middle line:84%
The government's role is to
defend the American people.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:32.344 align:middle line:84%
And when you have crazed
dictators screaming

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.546 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to annihilate us,

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:36.583 align:middle line:84%
you have got to take
some action.

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.952 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say, "Oh,
he's just trying

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:41.421 align:middle line:90%
to bribe us for rice and food."

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.256 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do
something about it.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:84%
And we're not doing
anything about it.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.528 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody in Congress raising
this issue that you bring

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.363 align:middle line:90%
up in one second later?

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have a delete button,

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:54.968 align:middle line:84%
because I might lose my
temper in about 10 seconds.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Guys, do you have
a delete button?

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:02.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. George, I'm a historian
and my PhD, my specialization,

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
was in military history and
the history of technology.

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:08.848 align:middle line:84%
And it is so easy
for us now to say,

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
"If only we had stopped
Hitler in '38."

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.652 align:middle line:90%
The handwriting was on the wall.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:16.255 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until '45 as we came
in and we found the death camps

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:18.291 align:middle line:84%
that so many people
went, "Oh, my god."

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:21.294 align:middle line:84%
If we had only said to
the Japanese in 1941,

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.829 align:middle line:90%
"Don't even think about it."

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:23.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history
we have faced this

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:29.636 align:middle line:84%
and we dismiss these lunatics,
these rogue regimes, and say,

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.838 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, they're really
not a threat."

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.107 align:middle line:84%
And then the people who
are telling us that,

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.308 align:middle line:84%
they go hide in the
high grass...

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:36.509 align:middle line:90%
>> ...a day later...

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.511 align:middle line:84%
>> ...when the world's
plunged into war.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.947 align:middle line:84%
We could recover
from Pearl Harbor.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.783 align:middle line:84%
We can recover and
we have from 911.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:47.687 align:middle line:84%
We cannot recover
within our lifetimes

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.455 align:middle line:90%
if we're hit by an EMP strike.

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:53.393 align:middle line:84%
It is a game ending -- it's
a first-strike game-ender.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as you know, I
spend a lot of time going

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.964 align:middle line:84%
between Los Angeles
and Saint Louis.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been in the
Midwest during a tornado --

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.336 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen the rubble
of Joplin, Missouri,

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:05.905 align:middle line:84%
that had that tragedy
a few years ago --

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:10.443 align:middle line:84%
if people go without
power for three days,

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.512 align:middle line:90%
they start going nuts.

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:16.749 align:middle line:84%
How long would it take -- and
we'll talk about the grid,

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.917 align:middle line:90%
how long would it take

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:21.754 align:middle line:84%
to get the power restored
under an EMP attack?

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:22.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.992 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have backup
transformers, right?

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:26.726 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.194 align:middle line:90%
>> They're very big.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.596 align:middle line:84%
Probably some of them are
made in other countries.

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:34.834 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have one
readily available to move in.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.869 align:middle line:90%
How long would the power be out?

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:39.472 align:middle line:84%
>> George, I attended a
conference several years ago,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.408 align:middle line:84%
upstate New York, Impact
America, which brought together

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.044 align:middle line:84%
about a thousand
specialists on this topic.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.579 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the generators.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.882 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's take this glass and
say this is a power generator,

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:52.852 align:middle line:84%
and the one over
there is your home.

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.854 align:middle line:84%
There's a hundred miles
of high-tension wires...

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:55.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:56.622 align:middle line:90%
>> ...substations, and all that.

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.891 align:middle line:90%
There is a major vulnerability.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle line:84%
I saw a frightful video of
what happens to those hundreds

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:02.929 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of miles

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.431 align:middle line:84%
of high-tension lines
under an EMP strike.

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.199 align:middle line:90%
They explode.

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:07.166 align:middle line:90%
>> They cook, don't they?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.134 align:middle line:84%
>> They -- no, right
off the pillars.

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:10.837 align:middle line:84%
>> So even if you were able
to preserve your generator,

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.872 align:middle line:84%
which is doubtful,
even if you were able

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:16.776 align:middle line:84%
to preserve your equipment
at home, which is doubtful,

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:17.977 align:middle line:90%
you can't get the power out.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.512 align:middle line:84%
Here's a scary estimate
[two knocks].

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
At the conference a team
had evaluated 500 generating

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.153 align:middle line:84%
systems, the major generating
systems east of the Mississippi.

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:30.556 align:middle line:84%
80% will still be
offline five years later.

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:31.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Five years later.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So imagine -- what's
the basis of our economy,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.729 align:middle line:84%
and we worry about our
economic times right now,

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:42.435 align:middle line:84%
but imagine if we lost 80% of
our power capacity completely.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Frightening.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.003 align:middle line:90%
>> That is...

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.239 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have an
old grid system...

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.643 align:middle line:84%
>> ...that couldn't
withstand hardly anything.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:51.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.813 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had power
outages before --

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.882 align:middle line:90%
Canada, the Northeast...

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:12:00.119 align:middle line:84%
>> ...for a few days, for
weeks, caused by strange things

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred -- power
transformers blowing up,

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:06.626 align:middle line:84%
trees falling on wires,
and things like that.

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Just a year ago in Southern
California, in that region,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.766 align:middle line:84%
three million people
without power.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.035 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't handle it.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.338 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the catastrophes
we have faced --

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.841 align:middle line:90%
Katrina was a local event.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.242 align:middle line:84%
I live in Asheville,
North Carolina.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> As tragic as it was.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.711 align:middle line:90%
>> As tragic as it was.

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.881 align:middle line:84%
Within a day -- I teach at
a small Christian college --

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.317 align:middle line:84%
we had truckloads
of supplies going

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:34.086 align:middle line:84%
down to a sister
school in the area.

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:37.456 align:middle line:84%
Trucks -- supplies were coming
in from all over the country.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:40.393 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when it's
the entire United States

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:41.027 align:middle line:90%
that's down...

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't do it.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.262 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and the transportation
grid is down,

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.063 align:middle line:90%
and the communications...

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.264 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't do it.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.766 align:middle line:84%
>> ...grid is down, and
the water supply is down,

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.634 align:middle line:84%
and the food distribution
system is down,

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and the medical supply
systems are down?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.438 align:middle line:90%
>> People will riot.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.139 align:middle line:90%
They'll go crazy.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:54.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes. Yes.

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:56.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take some questions
for William Forstchen.

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:59.111 align:middle line:84%
Who's got some as
we talk about EMPs?

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.047 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're talking
about it primarily

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.982 align:middle line:90%
from some kind of an attack.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.183 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:05.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
taking my question.

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:10.356 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to protect my ham
radio, my vehicle, my generator

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.024 align:middle line:90%
at home, to keep me up and going

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.393 align:middle line:84%
when something like
this happens?

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Give a highlight
William because we're going

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:16.996 align:middle line:84%
to do a demonstration
at the end...

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.065 align:middle line:84%
>> ...of the program
on what he can do.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:22.068 align:middle line:84%
But it is fixable in
some cases, right?

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:24.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. Sir, it's
a great question.

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.575 align:middle line:84%
When I first started researching
the book I kept thinking

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
top-down response.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.514 align:middle line:84%
If only I can see our
federal government responding

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:35.882 align:middle line:90%
and then state to local.

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle line:84%
In the last couple of years
my view on that has changed.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:40.653 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.854 align:middle line:90%
It's about we, the people.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.457 align:middle line:84%
It's about Americans
being Americans,

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
which means we become
self-reliant.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And, sir, it's amazing the
number of start-up industries

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:54.367 align:middle line:84%
within the last several years
addressing these type of issues.

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:55.334 align:middle line:84%
We're going to demonstrate
a couple

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.503 align:middle line:84%
of little items later
in the show.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.272 align:middle line:90%
There are a tremendous number

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:02.008 align:middle line:84%
of things you can
do to be prepared.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:84%
One, to be able to get
through, say, the first 30 days

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.681 align:middle line:84%
of any emergency, whether it's
EMP, earthquake, or whatever;

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.716 align:middle line:84%
but also a little bit
of long-term planning.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:13.185 align:middle line:84%
And it's not expensive,
it's doable.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:16.122 align:middle line:84%
I have become convinced
that we, the people,

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:90%
we have to act on our own.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.327 align:middle line:84%
Let's not worry about
FEMA coming to save us.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's work together as a
team that, if necessary,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.299 align:middle line:90%
we can rebuild our country.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:31.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the bottom line,
William, we're just up a creek

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:35.741 align:middle line:84%
if something like this happens,
and what we really need to do is

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.912 align:middle line:84%
to just make sure that
these rogue nations don't do

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.414 align:middle line:90%
anything stupid?

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:44.917 align:middle line:84%
Case in point; you know,
we've been in the nuclear era

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.553 align:middle line:90%
with Russia for 60 years.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.822 align:middle line:90%
China has joined the club.

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.325 align:middle line:90%
Not one has launched.

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.795 align:middle line:84%
They're smart enough to know
that if they do we're going

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:59.098 align:middle line:84%
to retaliate in a big
way, and everybody loses.

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.499 align:middle line:90%
But some of these lunatics,

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:84%
these rogue nations
we've been talking about,

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.337 align:middle line:90%
who would do these things

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:84%
in a clandestine
way, they don't care.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:11.243 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they
have nothing to lose.

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:14.847 align:middle line:84%
Those are the entities we
have to be concerned about.

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:20.886 align:middle line:84%
And, honestly, we need to just
take the nuclear capabilities

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.221 align:middle line:90%
out of their hands.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.257 align:middle line:90%
>> You hit the core issue.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:29.328 align:middle line:84%
Ever since the soviets
acquired nuclear devices in 1949

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:84%
and we got into the
arms race and a couple

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:35.167 align:middle line:84%
of us are old enough to remember
the Cold War and Duck and Cover,

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.603 align:middle line:84%
we had what was called
"mutual assured destruction."

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.804 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:41.974 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Soviets launched
at us it's a no-win game

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.176 align:middle line:84%
because enough of our
assets will survive

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that we will launch back and
I actually say, you know,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.415 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of glad the
Soviets are atheists

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.585 align:middle line:84%
because they were pragmatic
about it, they did not want

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:55.888 align:middle line:84%
to inherit a smoking
ruined world.

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.356 align:middle line:90%
So it was a no-win scenario.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, against these
nations there was not a launch.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.964 align:middle line:84%
But we are dealing with Iran
where their leader talks

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.267 align:middle line:90%
down a well to a hidden ahmad

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:84%
who is supposedly is
telling him, "end the world."

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle line:90%
>> End the world.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.138 align:middle line:90%
>> End the world.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:18.444 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have a wacko psycho
in Korea who might decide,

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:21.013 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to destroy America
just for the hell of it today."

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Neutral shore destruction
doesn't work with these people.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that does work is
a very aggressive foreign policy

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.356 align:middle line:84%
statement upfront, "Don't
even contemplate it."

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:31.791 align:middle line:90%
>> "We'll stop you first."

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.125 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is why.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.394 align:middle line:84%
Don't. Let's take another
question for William Forstchen.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.129 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir, way in the back here.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:42.034 align:middle line:84%
William, could you assess
the danger and probability

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:46.338 align:middle line:84%
of a terrorist group
using a non-nuclear device

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.107 align:middle line:90%
to induce an EMP?

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.242 align:middle line:84%
See, I would rank that as
being a much more highly,

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:55.147 align:middle line:84%
more probable event than
using a nuclear device.

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:56.348 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good point, sir.

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:59.485 align:middle line:84%
EMP can be generated a
number of different ways.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
just go on YouTube,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.091 align:middle line:90%
just look up Ford Taurus EMP,

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:09.862 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see a car that's
toasted up by a non-nuclear EMP.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:15.167 align:middle line:84%
The strategic drawback
to a non-nuclear EMP is

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.604 align:middle line:84%
at best you can generate
a blocks-wide,

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:21.739 align:middle line:90%
perhaps partial city event.

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Whereas, the nuke can...

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Can generate...

00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ...a country-wide
continental event.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.883 align:middle line:84%
So, in terms of particularly
tactical uses, an EMP,

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
non-nuke -- in fact,
they're already out there.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.224 align:middle line:84%
The one that we have to be very
concerned about is the nuke

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:42.094 align:middle line:84%
which can take out the entire
United States or Europe.

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:45.097 align:middle line:84%
And the perfect scenario
for our foes is to put three

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:49.101 align:middle line:84%
up over the United States:
East, Midwest, West;

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
lay down a blanket
across the continent,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.338 align:middle line:90%
take the whole grid out.

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:56.008 align:middle line:84%
>> And the damage from a
non-nuke is not, as you said,

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:58.811 align:middle line:84%
not as wide-spread
but it's also not

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.479 align:middle line:90%
that effective in the region.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.914 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't cook everything...

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.548 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:02.982 align:middle line:90%
>> ...for example.

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:03.816 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.184 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got high technology.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to one of our video
questions for William Forstchen.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, William.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.489 align:middle line:90%
This is Josh from Brooklyn,

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:14.493 align:middle line:84%
and I was wondering how real
is the threat of an EMP attack?

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Well...

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:16.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
great question, Josh.

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:17.396 align:middle line:90%
>> It really is.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello from Brooklyn.

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:20.833 align:middle line:90%
I grew up outside of Newark.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.334 align:middle line:90%
It is real.

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:26.105 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
clear statement made

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.641 align:middle line:90%
in the 2004 Congressional study

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:31.744 align:middle line:84%
which is another source I would
recommend people to go to.

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:36.415 align:middle line:84%
Just simply Google 2004
Congressional EMP Commission

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:38.517 align:middle line:90%
to get the full report.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:43.956 align:middle line:84%
One of the experts on it
said, "I cannot predict when,

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.891 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you
it will happen."

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:46.926 align:middle line:90%
>> It will happen eventually.

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:48.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Most likely in our lifetime.

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:53.465 align:middle line:84%
But then added on in the 2008
report, "When it comes to CME,

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.968 align:middle line:84%
a solar event which basically
triggers the same type

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.837 align:middle line:84%
of phenomena, that
is inevitable.

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.739 align:middle line:84%
And the odds are running
down on us right now.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:01.974 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you're right.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.642 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more question
for William Forstchen.

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:04.743 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, right here.

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.779 align:middle line:84%
>> William, we don't
hear very much about it

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.447 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream media.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:11.717 align:middle line:84%
Is it being suppressed
by the U.S. Government?

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's just say if
we don't talk about it,

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to worry about it.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.826 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get into
the political side on this,

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
but I think all of us at times
feel tremendous frustration

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.433 align:middle line:84%
when we see what we think is a
very crucial news item related

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:30.936 align:middle line:84%
to national defense, foreign
policy, that gets buried

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:35.808 align:middle line:84%
under because some starlet
had another drunken brawl

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.109 align:middle line:90%
or whatever [laughter].

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:42.114 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to go near
that any further, all right?

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:44.783 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems,
as conveyed to me

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:47.886 align:middle line:84%
by a remarkable congressman,
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:51.457 align:middle line:84%
out of Maryland, who asked
me to write this book --

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:53.025 align:middle line:84%
and he just so happened
to be gerrymandered

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.094 align:middle line:84%
out in the last election
-- is to build a --

00:19:55.094 --> 00:19:58.731 align:middle line:84%
the problem with EMP is
there's no constituency.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:00.432 align:middle line:90%
Very few people know about it.

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:90%
For example, do you know

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that Congress several years
back passed a law forbidding us

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.438 align:middle line:90%
from owning chimpanzees?

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:10.242 align:middle line:90%
I'd ask the audience, why?

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:12.077 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because of
that horrible attack.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.145 align:middle line:90%
Remember several years ago...

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Of that -- ripped
off the lady's face.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:84%
>> So, George, if you
ever drop over my house,

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:90%
the chimpanzee is gone.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.051 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about it.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.219 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have to
worry about that.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.687 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to
worry about that any more.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:23.355 align:middle line:90%
Now, yes, we needed that law,

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.923 align:middle line:84%
but how many people
does it affect?

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:25.691 align:middle line:90%
One or two?

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Congress and Bartlett
for 12 years kept trying

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:32.731 align:middle line:84%
to get something done on EMP
but nobody was paying attention.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like if you talk
about EMPing in your forest

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.569 align:middle line:84%
and the trees are
falling as well,

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%
and the media isn't
there, it doesn't exist.

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:42.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
let's talk for a moment

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:45.277 align:middle line:84%
about the Boston Marathon
bombing that just occurred.

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:84%
Who would have suspected
a couple thugs

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:56.255 align:middle line:84%
to put pressure cookers loaded
with bomb-making material

00:20:56.255 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
in a knapsack and blow up
the region there, you know,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.797 align:middle line:84%
and kill the number of people
and injure hundreds of others?

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Who would have expected that?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.567 align:middle line:90%
But it happened..

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:09.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it did.

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it's
the same thing

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.306 align:middle line:90%
with a nuke and an EMP attack.

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:17.276 align:middle line:84%
One may not think
it's going to happen.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.379 align:middle line:84%
One may not hope
it's going to happen.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:24.183 align:middle line:84%
But one day some moron,
some idiot, is going to use

00:21:24.183 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that capability and
try it and test it.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.291 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need to
be alert for because our way

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.727 align:middle line:90%
of living is over when...

00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:35.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:36.729 align:middle line:84%
>> ...something like
that happens.

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.464 align:middle line:84%
>> George, and you
notice, for example,

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:41.133 align:middle line:84%
let's deal with the real
horrible tragedy recently

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.903 align:middle line:84%
of Newtown or what happened
just outside of Denver...

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.872 align:middle line:90%
>> ...in Aurora.

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:50.275 align:middle line:84%
How the day after the event we
keep saying, "If only, if only,

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:53.312 align:middle line:84%
if only we had done this,
if only we had done that."

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the problem with EMP
is there's no room for saying

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.384 align:middle line:90%
"if only" the day after the...

00:21:58.384 --> 00:21:59.785 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got one chance.

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:01.053 align:middle line:90%
>> ...event.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And it is to prepare
individually if it is going

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:08.327 align:middle line:84%
to happen, but then also
prepare as a nation to convey

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.461 align:middle line:90%
"don't even think about it

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:12.865 align:middle line:84%
because we will stop you
in any way possible."

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:15.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the sun
and a coronal mass ejection.

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:17.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we can't stop the
sun from doing this, right.

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And then the possibilities.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.974 align:middle line:84%
You had said 90% of
the population dies.

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:23.075 align:middle line:90%
I want you to paint

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.144 align:middle line:84%
that scenario a little
bit later on for us.

00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And just take it through us, and
let's assume something happens,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.417 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to tell us
what's going on on the planet,

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:32.985 align:middle line:90%
how will we reacting,

00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:36.188 align:middle line:84%
what systems are collapsing,
and how people react.

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:39.191 align:middle line:84%
But the sun, we cannot
stop that.

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:42.261 align:middle line:84%
One day, in X-flare
-- we've been lucky.

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:46.365 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have smaller class
flares, then M-class flares,

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:50.135 align:middle line:84%
and then the big ones: the
X-flares, which are then X-1

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:52.404 align:middle line:90%
up to [inaudible], X-15 or 20.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:53.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:54.406 align:middle line:90%
>> The higher that number

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:57.676 align:middle line:84%
on the X-scale the more
deadly it is for the planet.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.311 align:middle line:90%
We've been lucky.

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:03.649 align:middle line:84%
Most of the big flares of recent
times have shot off toward

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:04.817 align:middle line:90%
the side.

00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:07.619 align:middle line:84%
We weren't in direct
relationship with the sun.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:11.323 align:middle line:84%
But the day's going to come
when the sun's going to be there

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be here and
it's going to be a perfect shot.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a big one, my radio
show's knocked off the air,

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:20.599 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other things.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:21.166 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.201 align:middle line:90%
>> That quick.

00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:90%
If that happens, it's gone.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.937 align:middle line:90%
>> It's over for all of us.

00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:25.838 align:middle line:84%
>> What am I going to -- well,
what am I going to do later?

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:26.805 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:27.739 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
it's all done?

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:28.841 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll just stare
at the ceiling.

00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:31.343 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's a
very real possibility.

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:32.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:35.247 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you protect
on something like that?

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a scary
question because --

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.754 align:middle line:84%
let us say the United States
endured an EMP strike.

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.089 align:middle line:90%
We still, I'd like to think,

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.158 align:middle line:84%
have some friends
around the world...

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Who will jump in and help.

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.427 align:middle line:90%
>> ...who will jump in.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
However, most of all our
high-end electronic equipment

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:84%
for power distribution
and everything else --

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:54.867 align:middle line:90%
guess where it's made?

00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.201 align:middle line:90%
>> China.

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. Do you think they're
really going to rush boats

00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:59.304 align:middle line:84%
over with, "Oh, we
wish to help you."?

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:01.607 align:middle line:84%
But now let's consider
a global event.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:02.708 align:middle line:90%
Now you remember, the closer

00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:04.977 align:middle line:84%
to the Pole you get
the more intense it is.

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:06.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:08.013 align:middle line:84%
>> The Carrington Event would
most likely have taken things

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:12.084 align:middle line:84%
out all the way down to 25
degrees South, 25 degrees North.

00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:14.219 align:middle line:84%
>> But they didn't have a lot
of electronics in those days.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:15.387 align:middle line:90%
There was just a telegraph.

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:15.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:17.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:21.093 align:middle line:84%
>> So imagine a global-wide
shutdown of power grids

00:24:21.093 --> 00:24:22.628 align:middle line:90%
and systems going offline.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:23.328 align:middle line:90%
>> No image.

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:23.962 align:middle line:90%
>> If you remember that.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:24.463 align:middle line:90%
>> No television.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:24.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.098 align:middle line:90%
>> No radio.

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:26.798 align:middle line:84%
>> No [multiple voices]
command and control.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:27.366 align:middle line:90%
>> No communications.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:90%
No cell phones.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.701 align:middle line:90%
>> No text messaging.

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:31.904 align:middle line:90%
Nothing. Everything's gone.

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:84%
Every store is tied into
some form of electronics.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.309 align:middle line:90%
There was a power outage

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:40.879 align:middle line:84%
in Saint Louis last
year, lasted six hours.

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:44.883 align:middle line:84%
A local drugstore chain --
the power was knocked out.

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:90%
They tried to do it manually.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.687 align:middle line:90%
Number one, the young kids

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:53.225 align:middle line:84%
who were working there couldn't
subtract in their heads.

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:57.162 align:middle line:84%
If, you know, somebody gave you
a 20 and your bill was 8.68,

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know that
it was 11.32 in change.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.335 align:middle line:90%
People were lined up like crazy.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.436 align:middle line:90%
It was a disaster.

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.438 align:middle line:90%
They shut the store down.

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:08.273 align:middle line:90%
That would happen too.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't have cash registers
that function anymore.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.345 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
old-style anymore

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.414 align:middle line:84%
where the lady would
push the button

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:18.216 align:middle line:90%
and it would register on print.

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:19.818 align:middle line:84%
Everything's electronic,
everything.

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:23.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. What do you
guys have in your wallets?

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Credit cards.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.091 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't use them.

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:26.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Several weeks ago...

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.426 align:middle line:90%
>> ATMs.

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:28.126 align:middle line:90%
>> You remember Cypress?

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:28.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:30.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Where they had the bank panic

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they shut
down all the ATMs...

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.265 align:middle line:90%
>> All the ATMs.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.567 align:middle line:90%
>> ...and people were panicked.

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:39.871 align:middle line:84%
And in a post-EMP
or CME scenario --

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
within a matter of hours
people are going to be going,

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
"I better get my money
out of the bank."

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.778 align:middle line:84%
Almost all our money
is electronic.

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:47.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:48.347 align:middle line:90%
>> It is gone.

00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:50.082 align:middle line:84%
>> And even if you
had physical money

00:25:50.082 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:90%
at that time, what good is it?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:53.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you can't
buy anything.

00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:53.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:55.687 align:middle line:90%
>> You try to get to a store

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
when it's a system-wide
blackout.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.725 align:middle line:90%
You can't get in.

00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:02.194 align:middle line:84%
>> And even if you do get it,
is the store owner really going

00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:03.662 align:middle line:90%
to take that $50 bill from you?

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.397 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you get
robbed coming out.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Pandemonium.

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:08.934 align:middle line:84%
>> We're really getting
depressing here, aren't we?

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:09.901 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it.

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:10.969 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's, that's
what I meant.

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
This is not a program
where we're going

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.772 align:middle line:90%
to be smiling and it's not...

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's making people aware.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.108 align:middle line:90%
That's why I...

00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:18.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. But I guarantee
you, one day, whether it's

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
from the sun or from a rogue
nation that sets off a nuke

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.954 align:middle line:84%
that creates an EMP attack
on us, people are going

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:29.721 align:middle line:90%
to say, "You know what?

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.289 align:middle line:90%
I heard about this.

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:34.126 align:middle line:84%
I heard that William
Forstchen talk about that

00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:36.428 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't believe him."

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.863 align:middle line:90%
But it will be too late.

00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:39.531 align:middle line:90%
>> You know my fear?

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.466 align:middle line:84%
A mob might be coming
up my driveway saying,

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:44.202 align:middle line:84%
"Because you wrote the book,
this is all your fault."

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:44.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.004 align:middle line:90%
>> So...

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we know you're
taking care of it.

00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:49.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait. Well, we know that you
have stuff stashed away there.

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:52.911 align:middle line:84%
>> And -- let me segue
on that for a second.

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:56.915 align:middle line:84%
If all of us as Americans
simply adopted the attitude of,

00:26:56.915 --> 00:27:00.686 align:middle line:84%
"I've got to be able to take
care of myself for 30 days,"

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
think of how we could get
over that initial hump if we,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.393 align:middle line:84%
even at our state and
local areas, said, "Okay,

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:10.362 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take some
communications here..."

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:11.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:14.666 align:middle line:84%
>> "...and proof it so
we can be back online

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:18.537 align:middle line:84%
and directing, commanding
control."

00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
How much easier it would be to
get through those first 30 days

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.243 align:middle line:84%
and start getting ourselves
working together as Americans.

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:27.212 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it's mass
panic within hours.

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:27.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:28.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:28.714 --> 00:27:32.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Huge. Paint the
scenario for me.

00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:35.987 align:middle line:90%
An EMP or a CME hits us.

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:37.823 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember the old Rod
Sterling introduction,

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:40.959 align:middle line:84%
"Presented for your
consideration..."

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:41.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.128 align:middle line:90%
>> ..."an ultimate nightmare."?

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:46.531 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's consider like a
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember it used to be
oxygen and all that.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.868 align:middle line:84%
First day it's going
to go down as,

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:52.237 align:middle line:90%
where does your water come from?

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.972 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Well, you have a
well in your backyard.

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.173 align:middle line:90%
But that's electrical power.

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:84%
>> That's electric and
not everybody has a well.

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I was doing a radio
program a couple of years ago

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.213 align:middle line:84%
out of Phoenix where
somebody called up,

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:02.581 align:middle line:90%
was a little dismissive,

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.317 align:middle line:84%
and then the weather forecast
came on, and the weather --

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:06.585 align:middle line:90%
another nice day in Phoenix.

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:08.053 align:middle line:90%
It will be 110 this afternoon...

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:08.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:10.155 align:middle line:90%
>> ...going down to 95 at night.

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:12.023 align:middle line:84%
What happens if Phoenix
is without water?

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.292 align:middle line:84%
What happens if Denver
is without?

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:17.462 align:middle line:84%
Well, the entire United
States' water supply system is

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:20.332 align:middle line:84%
electrically dependent not
only for getting to you,

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:23.001 align:middle line:84%
but for going away
and being sanitized...

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:24.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.437 align:middle line:84%
See, but most people
think when they turn

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.106 align:middle line:84%
on their spigot the
water just pressures out.

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:29.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Comes out, yes.

00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:32.144 align:middle line:84%
>> No. There's an electrical
plant there pushing it

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:33.812 align:middle line:90%
out to the people.

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:36.848 align:middle line:84%
>> So, as we run down this
nightmare scenario, water.

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.317 align:middle line:84%
And then within three
to five days we'll start

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:41.987 align:middle line:84%
to see massive outbreaks
of gastrointestinal illness

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:43.622 align:middle line:90%
from water-borne disease.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:47.225 align:middle line:84%
Two, the average community has
at most about three weeks' worth

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:50.495 align:middle line:84%
of food supply on hand
that's in your refrigerators

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.264 align:middle line:90%
which are now starting to decay.

00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:53.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.066 align:middle line:84%
>> It's in your markets
which are starting to decay.

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.568 align:middle line:90%
Or it might be on supply trucks.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.404 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 21 days we're
starting to run out of food.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:28:59.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:00.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Your medical.

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:02.407 align:middle line:90%
This is the scary one.

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:05.944 align:middle line:84%
Place a -- I'll bet at least one
person in our studio audience is

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:09.381 align:middle line:84%
on a medication that they're
dependent on as life-sustaining,

00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:14.085 align:middle line:84%
or maybe pain control
sustaining.

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:17.088 align:middle line:84%
Your pharmacy will not
be able to supply you.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:20.058 align:middle line:84%
So if you only have a four-day
supply of a crucial medication

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:22.194 align:middle line:84%
on hand, at the end of four
days you're in trouble.

00:29:22.194 --> 00:29:23.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're in
trouble, absolutely.

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
>> About 20% of Americans are
on some sort of anti-depressant

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.401 align:middle line:84%
or mood-altering
drug, but about 1% are

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.670 align:middle line:90%
on anti-psychotic medications.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.905 align:middle line:84%
What happens to them
within 30 days?

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:37.375 align:middle line:84%
The entire transportation
grid is gone.

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Now there's debate
about how many...

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.712 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not flying
planes at that point, right

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:44.149 align:middle line:84%
>> No. But some people
say, "Oh, only 10 to 20%

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.551 align:middle line:90%
of our cars will break down."

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.222 align:middle line:84%
Well, suppose you're on the
interstate at 5 o'clock and 10%

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:51.289 align:middle line:84%
of the cars around
you break down.

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.124 align:middle line:90%
>> You're up a creek.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:53.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.026 align:middle line:90%
>> And really, the only cars

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.628 align:middle line:84%
that would function
are the real old ones.

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>> I drew a lot of
my information

00:29:58.063 --> 00:30:02.033 align:middle line:84%
as to what would happen
drawing on examples of the Seige

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:06.371 align:middle line:84%
of Stalingraad, the Seige
of Leningrad, where --

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and I actually wrote
it into my novel --

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.079 align:middle line:84%
where after a month the ration
was down to 700 calories a day

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:18.016 align:middle line:84%
for non-combatants and people
were receiving two slices

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:21.219 align:middle line:84%
of bread, of which a third
to a half of the content

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:90%
of the bread was wood pulp.

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.657 align:middle line:84%
>> You know why they
were doing that?

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.094 align:middle line:84%
Because when the person ate
the wood pulp, the bread, it...

00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:29.928 align:middle line:90%
>> They can't stand it.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:30.762 align:middle line:90%
>> ...swells up their stomach...

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And they weren't as hungry.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.598 align:middle line:84%
>> They weren't as hungry
as they starved to death.

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what about this?

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The power goes out and
our nuclear power plants,

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:43.475 align:middle line:84%
which are dependent on
cooling, can't cool any more.

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:45.377 align:middle line:90%
So we have meltdowns.

00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:46.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:50.348 align:middle line:84%
>> The China Syndrome all
over again at every plant.

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:54.786 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a nuclear problem
at every -- now we got a --

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:57.589 align:middle line:84%
what, 120 nuke plants
in this country?

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.958 align:middle line:90%
All of them will have a problem.

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.526 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to emphasize
something right here.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:02.794 align:middle line:90%
This is my disclaimer.

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:06.398 align:middle line:84%
I only work with unclassified
declassified material.

00:31:06.398 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I've asked questions
about nuke plants,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.069 align:middle line:84%
and the people I've asked
this of just stare back

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:12.304 align:middle line:90%
and say, "Next question."

00:31:12.304 --> 00:31:13.738 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't want to answer it.

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:16.241 align:middle line:84%
>> But as declassified, as
several have pointed out,

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:19.611 align:middle line:84%
it's built -- suppose
we're able to get this --

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.613 align:middle line:90%
to turn the nuke plant back on.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:24.082 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a tremendous
amount of electricity going

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:27.419 align:middle line:84%
into that plant for days
before we can power up

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:29.688 align:middle line:84%
and we can start pumping
the electric back out.

00:31:29.688 --> 00:31:30.822 align:middle line:90%
>>> Hmm-mm.

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:84%
>> So we might actually
be looking at a resource

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.993 align:middle line:84%
to start pumping out that
gigawatts of energy again but,

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
one, we can't get the energy
in to start it; and, two,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.198 align:middle line:90%
even if we get it start started,

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:41.466 align:middle line:84%
we don't have any
power lines anymore.

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I think the meltdown
[multiple voices] based

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:44.169 align:middle line:90%
on that...

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:45.103 align:middle line:90%
>> The meltdown is terrifying

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:46.604 align:middle line:84%
>> ...is the worse
possibility...

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:47.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:47.172 --> 00:31:47.605 align:middle line:90%
>> ...for us.

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:48.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:48.173 --> 00:31:49.607 align:middle line:90%
>> The worst.

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:56.581 align:middle line:84%
>> And you will not have a civil
defense system able to warn you

00:31:56.581 --> 00:32:00.785 align:middle line:84%
that this power plant 200 miles
away has gone and is putting

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:03.254 align:middle line:84%
out a radioactive plume
that's heading your way,

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:04.422 align:middle line:90%
and you better take shelter.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.757 align:middle line:90%
>> And how many...

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Consider a world without
communications of that type.

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:13.198 align:middle line:84%
>> How many people, when people
start dying, will simply say,

00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:16.501 align:middle line:84%
"I'm checking out; I
don't want to be around."?

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.703 align:middle line:90%
And they kill themselves.

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:21.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Suicide rate in
Leningrad was horrific...

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:22.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:25.043 align:middle line:84%
>> ...as it was in Berlin,
during the siege of Berlin

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:28.279 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the war.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:33.018 align:middle line:84%
And -- I don't want to
get upset about this --

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:36.221 align:middle line:84%
as I wrote this book, my
father was in a nursing home.

00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:38.723 align:middle line:84%
He was fighting out the
last months of his life,

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:41.593 align:middle line:84%
going out as a tough old World
War II trooper that he was.

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:42.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.963 align:middle line:84%
>> And I asked the nurse
one day, "If this happened

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:84%
in the power generators and
our nursing homes went down,

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.002 align:middle line:90%
what happens?"

00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:51.836 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all gone.

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.104 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all gone.

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:56.374 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the people
with Alzheimer's who need

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:58.209 align:middle line:84%
that bracelet on
and to keep them

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.244 align:middle line:84%
from wandering out
of the building?

00:32:59.244 --> 00:33:00.812 align:middle line:84%
>> And the person
who needs dialysis.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:04.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Where's my father's pain
medication after 24 hours?

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:08.319 align:middle line:84%
Because they only keep a
limited supply on hand.

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:10.155 align:middle line:90%
That -- in fact, the book --

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.223 align:middle line:84%
I dedicated the book to
my father and my daughter.

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Right. And is that why

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:16.795 align:middle line:84%
in  One Second After
you use a diabetic kid...

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:17.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:17.796 --> 00:33:19.531 align:middle line:84%
>> ...to explain
what he goes through?

00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:24.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. Yes, we have
done remarkable things

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.604 align:middle line:84%
with our medical technology
in the last hundred years,

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:31.042 align:middle line:84%
but they're all dependent on
very high-tech applications.

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:33.912 align:middle line:84%
That child -- a diabetic
child would have died 50,

00:33:33.912 --> 00:33:35.547 align:middle line:90%
75 years ago.

00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But without insulin,
within a matter of weeks.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Have we gotten too
dependent on technology?

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.925 align:middle line:84%
>> No, in the sense that if
the technology is there we will

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:90%
use it.

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:51.262 align:middle line:84%
If I ask -- how many of
you will now stand up,

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:90%
take out your cell phones,

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.499 align:middle line:84%
and stamp on them,
and walk out of here?

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:58.436 align:middle line:84%
No. It's become part of
our lives, our GPS's,

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:01.573 align:middle line:84%
our infrastructure,
our Internet.

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:04.109 align:middle line:84%
It's enriched our
lives in so many ways.

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:07.311 align:middle line:84%
But we have not caught up
with the vulnerabilities

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.646 align:middle line:84%
to those systems
at the same time.

00:34:09.646 --> 00:34:11.349 align:middle line:84%
That is the message
you're getting

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:12.817 align:middle line:90%
out that I'm so grateful for.

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:16.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of me, part of me
would like to see the sun kick

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:90%
out an X-flare that would...

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.125 align:middle line:90%
>> He's saying this, not me.

00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:24.195 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying this -- that would
hit a region of this planet

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.831 align:middle line:90%
that might not be too inhabited,

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:30.934 align:middle line:84%
but enough to make the
world look at what happened;

00:34:30.934 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and maybe it would take

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.974 align:middle line:84%
out whatever power was
there and things like that.

00:34:35.974 --> 00:34:37.474 align:middle line:90%
We need an example.

00:34:37.474 --> 00:34:40.311 align:middle line:84%
We need people to
look at this and say,

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:42.680 align:middle line:90%
"This is a real possibility."

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.151 align:middle line:84%
And I think most politicians,
William, stick their heads

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:49.186 align:middle line:84%
in the sand and they say,
"This is not going to happen

00:34:49.186 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:84%
on my watch so I don't
have to worry about it."

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.125 align:middle line:84%
Well, let the guy in the
future worry about it.

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.492 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:34:55.492 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from Saint
Louis, saw my six grandchildren

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.734 align:middle line:84%
and my three kids,
and I don't want this

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:90%
to happen to them, you know?

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.472 align:middle line:84%
Whether it happens
in my lifetime

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:09.073 align:middle line:90%
or not is not the issue.

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.976 align:middle line:90%
What about them and their kids?

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.978 align:middle line:84%
And we're not doing
anything for them.

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And we need to.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.583 align:middle line:84%
>> The inspiration for writing
the book came from many sources,

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.919 align:middle line:90%
and one of them was I'm sitting

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:23.154 align:middle line:84%
up on the stage on
graduation day.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.156 align:middle line:84%
I teach history at
a small college.

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:27.225 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at my students.

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.594 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you I
got a lump in my throat,

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:31.029 align:middle line:90%
and that was actually --

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.097 align:middle line:84%
that's when I started
writing the book, that night.

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.666 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
to my kids?

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:36.134 align:middle line:90%
They become your kids.

00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:84%
These wonderful 21,
20 year olds,

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.705 align:middle line:84%
who are just graduating
from college.

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen to my...

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's hope.

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:43.141 align:middle line:84%
>> ...what's going to
happen to my little girl?

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.476 align:middle line:84%
>> I want America to be
better for my children

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:47.979 align:middle line:84%
and grandchildren than
the America my father

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:48.880 align:middle line:90%
and mother gave to me.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.747 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a nightmare.

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:50.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:50.415 --> 00:35:51.482 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a nightmare.

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:54.285 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a mass
extinction situation.

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:58.089 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be a mass
extinction event.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:00.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are going to
get into the possibilities

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:03.494 align:middle line:84%
of what we might be
able to do to minimize

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that which is really
so important.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.866 align:middle line:84%
But what got you
to write this book?

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.336 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
thing that came to you?

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:14.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you an expert in
EMPs when you started this?

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:19.143 align:middle line:84%
>> I studied -- as I mentioned
I got my PhD at Purdue,

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:84%
military history,
history technology.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.485 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of the strategic
combat use of EMP in the event

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.754 align:middle line:90%
of a war with the Soviet Union.

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:35.827 align:middle line:84%
And back in '04 the
commission report came out.

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:41.199 align:middle line:84%
That's what hit me -- Meeting
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:44.335 align:middle line:84%
who lamented to me, "Nobody
paid attention to this report."

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:46.671 align:middle line:84%
>> That -- ironically,
that report came

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.307 align:middle line:84%
out on the same day the 911
Commission Report came out.

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:51.976 align:middle line:84%
Whoever planned that
should lose their job...

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:52.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:53.778 align:middle line:84%
>> ...because as
Bartlett put it...

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:55.546 align:middle line:90%
>> It got buried, it got buried.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:56.814 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, "We were
looking backwards

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:58.516 align:middle line:90%
at how the last war started..."

00:36:58.516 --> 00:36:59.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:01.552 align:middle line:84%
>> ..."when this report is
telling us how the next war will

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:03.121 align:middle line:90%
destroy us completely."

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:04.689 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was paying
attention to it.

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.991 align:middle line:84%
They were all at the other
end of the building."

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what inspired me
to start writing the book.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.463 align:middle line:84%
Plus I had an incredible
publisher with Tom Doherty

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.765 align:middle line:90%
and Bob Gleason who you know.

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle line:90%
>> My buddies, yeah.

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:19.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And Saint Martin's
did a superb job on it and --

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:23.608 align:middle line:90%
it took four years, actually.

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:26.678 align:middle line:84%
>> What concerns you the most: a
solar event or a nuke, or both?

00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:28.913 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you that out.

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, if it happened
would I know the difference?

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.253 align:middle line:90%
>> No. No.

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:37.789 align:middle line:84%
Once the grid goes,
the grid goes.

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.791 align:middle line:84%
You know, and people are
concerned about, "Oh, my god.

00:37:39.791 --> 00:37:40.925 align:middle line:90%
My power's not on."

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:42.827 align:middle line:90%
>> You know.

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:45.029 align:middle line:84%
And what do you do if it's the
dead of winter and something

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:47.298 align:middle line:84%
like that happens
when it's 10 degrees

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:50.802 align:middle line:84%
out on the East Coast
and you have no heat?

00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:52.503 align:middle line:90%
You have no heat source.

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:55.506 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's where
that number, that 90% number,

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:84%
starts and it grows and I guess
it will be the elderly first

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.111 align:middle line:90%
that go?

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:00.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:01.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Little kids?

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:02.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:03.681 align:middle line:90%
>> And then what happens to...

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.216 align:middle line:84%
>> The nursing homes
-- we have millions

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.484 align:middle line:90%
of folks in nursing homes.

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.353 align:middle line:84%
I was very aware of that
because of both of my parents.

00:38:08.353 --> 00:38:09.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.557 align:middle line:84%
>> That's -- they're not
designed for anything other

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:16.160 align:middle line:84%
than a climate control
provided by electricity.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.631 align:middle line:84%
So we know the horror stories of
what happened in nursing homes

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:23.334 align:middle line:84%
with Katrina, where
people were found floating

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.435 align:middle line:90%
against the ceiling -- dead.

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.475 align:middle line:84%
>> And if that same kind of
event happened in Chicago

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.877 align:middle line:84%
in January, how many
would be found frozen

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:33.711 align:middle line:90%
to death a day later?

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:34.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Many.

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:34.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions.

00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:39.117 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, George, the last
catastrophe of this scale

00:38:39.117 --> 00:38:40.985 align:middle line:84%
of loss, even remotely
like this,

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:43.788 align:middle line:84%
was the American Civil
War 150 years ago.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We, as Americans, do not know
just how intense the suffering

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.031 align:middle line:84%
can be triggered by a
war or a catastrophe.

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:56.734 align:middle line:84%
I was in Russia some years ago
where I walked across a field

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that was still carpeted
with human bones...

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Ach.

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:03.474 align:middle line:90%
>> ...from a Stalinist massacre.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:05.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. You can just feel that.

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:08.079 align:middle line:84%
>> I could feel them
crunching under my feet

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.581 align:middle line:84%
and it was horrifying
to see the --

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:13.017 align:middle line:84%
and to see a child's
doll lying there.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Been out there for 65 years.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.088 align:middle line:90%
We as Americans are blessed.

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.590 align:middle line:84%
We live in the greatest,
safest place in the world.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.391 align:middle line:90%
>> So far.

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.726 align:middle line:90%
>> So far.

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:84%
But the number's going to
come up sooner or later.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.063 align:middle line:90%
We got to be ready for it.

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:28.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take some more
questions for William Forstchen.

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:32.236 align:middle line:90%
This is a very real possibility.

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.872 align:middle line:90%
I know its a little melancholy.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.307 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir.

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> William, thank you
for taking my questions.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You're, you know,
clearly an expert on this,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.116 align:middle line:84%
letting people know
what could happen.

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:49.921 align:middle line:84%
I'm a regular person, you know,
live in the greater Denver area.

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:51.722 align:middle line:90%
Don't own any firearms.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So do you have some kind of
like a prepping scenario planned

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.063 align:middle line:84%
out for maybe you, or your
loved ones, or families,

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.032 align:middle line:90%
or what would you suggest?

00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:03.301 align:middle line:84%
You know, I myself
am not a prepper,

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:05.069 align:middle line:90%
but I know people that are.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.805 align:middle line:84%
So if something like if a
catastrophe like this were

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.974 align:middle line:90%
to happen, how would --

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:12.643 align:middle line:84%
what would the first thing
that maybe you would be doing?

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:13.845 align:middle line:84%
>> So, thank you
for that question

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:16.214 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
clarify something.

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:20.251 align:middle line:84%
Too often in public
media it gets

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.954 align:middle line:90%
into this survivalist mentality.

00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:25.556 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't like
survivalists all that much

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.725 align:middle line:84%
because the survivalist
mentality is,

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:90%
"I've got mine, George.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.461 align:middle line:90%
You come to my door.

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.529 align:middle line:90%
The heck with you.

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.563 align:middle line:84%
You're not -- I'm not
going to help you.

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.931 align:middle line:90%
Get away from me."

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.967 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had a chance, George,
when you didn't do anything.

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:38.369 align:middle line:84%
>> You didn't do
it, so there, there.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.872 align:middle line:84%
The prepper movement which
has emerged in the last three

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:45.676 align:middle line:84%
to four years is far more
about us working together.

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:48.813 align:middle line:84%
How do I get to my
neighbors to work with?

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:51.949 align:middle line:84%
The doctor down the street
-- let's talk about a plan.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:55.453 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't cost all that
much to get started in terms

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.523 align:middle line:84%
of just getting some extra food
and you can get a 50 pound bag

00:40:58.523 --> 00:41:02.660 align:middle line:84%
of rice at one of the
box stores, like $15.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.896 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you're my neighbor,
George, I'll sit down with you.

00:41:04.896 --> 00:41:07.565 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, George, I'm
not some missionary

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.333 align:middle line:84%
at your doorstep
waving a pamphlet,

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.102 align:middle line:84%
but why don't you read
a couple of these books?

00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:11.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:15.206 align:middle line:90%
>> And then let's talk about it.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:18.209 align:middle line:84%
I will not mention the network
but I have a problem with a show

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:20.511 align:middle line:90%
that deals with preppers.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.746 align:middle line:90%
It makes them all look

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:24.048 align:middle line:84%
like they're wearing tinfoil
hats and they're crazy.

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:27.718 align:middle line:84%
Every prepper I know is
an ordinary person just

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:28.853 align:middle line:90%
like you, sir.

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.021 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just an ordinary
guy who had [inaudible].

00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:32.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Very serious about
what they doing.

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But they are very
oriented towards how do we --

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.629 align:middle line:84%
hey, try and survive
on your own or try

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:39.931 align:middle line:90%
and survive as a community.

00:41:39.931 --> 00:41:42.767 align:middle line:84%
Survive as a community
is a lot easier.

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to discuss
personal defense and things

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.306 align:middle line:84%
like that -- it's a
very sensitive issue --

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:51.375 align:middle line:84%
other than to say if you
make that kind of decision,

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:55.913 align:middle line:84%
for heaven's sake, follow the
law, get the proper training.

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.281 align:middle line:84%
That's all I'm going
to say on that.

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.951 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take another video
question for William Forstchen.

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:02.453 align:middle line:84%
Let's flip the switch,
and here we go.

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:03.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, William.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.221 align:middle line:90%
I'm JoAnne.

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.857 align:middle line:90%
I live in Los Angeles.

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.559 align:middle line:84%
How real is the threat
of a solar flare,

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:11.529 align:middle line:84%
and how long will
we be without power?

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:12.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Ho, ho, ho, ho.

00:42:12.797 --> 00:42:14.031 align:middle line:90%
Well?

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:19.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Los Angeles,
JoAnne -- it's real.

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.104 align:middle line:90%
>> And a long time.

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:24.475 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a very real
long term scenario.

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:28.546 align:middle line:84%
But even folks in L.A.
can properly prepare.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.981 align:middle line:84%
In spite of what
we're being told,

00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:31.315 align:middle line:90%
there's an optical illusion...

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:32.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:34.685 align:middle line:84%
>> ...a missile having taken off
the coast a couple of years ago.

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.821 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember that, story.

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:38.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Being a prepper
doesn't mean --

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.424 align:middle line:84%
and JoAnne can link
us back into the --

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.659 align:middle line:90%
this gentleman's question.

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.928 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you're
out in the countryside

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.197 align:middle line:84%
and you have a bunker
or you've got 50 acres

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:48.132 align:middle line:84%
and you're growing
this and that.

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:51.235 align:middle line:84%
You can be in a high-rise
in L.A. You could be

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:54.905 align:middle line:84%
out in the farmlands of
Colorado, or up in the Rockies.

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:57.408 align:middle line:84%
It's about community,
community, community.

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.311 align:middle line:84%
Working together as
a team, studying --

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of literature out
there, a lot of good books now

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.415 align:middle line:90%
on how to be prepared.

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.818 align:middle line:84%
My book is simply a cautionary
novel about what happens

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.954 align:middle line:84%
in a small town in
North Carolina.

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:12.423 align:middle line:84%
There are dozens of
good instruction manuals

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.291 align:middle line:90%
out there now as well, as to how

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.926 align:middle line:84%
to get started, how
to get ready.

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:18.562 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's just
not for CME or EMP.

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:23.501 align:middle line:84%
It could be earthquake, could
be storms, any number of things.

00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:26.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take another question
from the audience for William.

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:26.904 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.306 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back.

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
taking my question.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:33.077 align:middle line:84%
William, considering
the devastation

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.613 align:middle line:90%
that an EMP event would cause,

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.849 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't power
companies be taking steps

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:41.719 align:middle line:84%
in all ways possible
to protect us --

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.022 align:middle line:84%
protect their infrastructure
and us from such an event?

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:47.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, well.

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:47.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Ahhhhhh.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:48.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Really good question.

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:50.161 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from North Carolina.

00:43:50.161 --> 00:43:54.131 align:middle line:84%
I have yet quite to
master the accent.

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Jersey
does come out,

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:59.437 align:middle line:84%
but there was a big argument
about this in North Carolina

00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:00.905 align:middle line:90%
about a year or two ago,

00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:04.575 align:middle line:84%
in which a commission
there dismissed the threat.

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.878 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is
the increased cost

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.914 align:middle line:84%
to start preparing
our infrastructure is

00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:13.984 align:middle line:90%
about 10% to 15% increase.

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.553 align:middle line:84%
You've got to replace
an old power line.

00:44:15.553 --> 00:44:17.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Quite, and it's
got to be done.

00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:20.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Ten to 15% more
you can proof it.

00:44:20.458 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:84%
An analogy I give
there is hardening.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.095 align:middle line:90%
If we just harden parts

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:26.897 align:middle line:84%
of our infrastructure
it's like a spider web.

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.799 align:middle line:84%
Remember the spider webs,
we'd see in the lawn

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.835 align:middle line:90%
in the morning covered in dew?

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:32.269 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a bit of
a wacky kid you have

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:33.804 align:middle line:90%
to put a match under it.

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:35.706 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine if that
poor spider's in there.

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.007 align:middle line:90%
Darn kid again.

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.577 align:middle line:84%
But the spider had
hardened only eight or ten

00:44:39.577 --> 00:44:42.079 align:middle line:84%
of those threads
that were fireproof.

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:45.382 align:middle line:84%
How much easier to spin
the rest of the thread back

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:84%
but also provide emergency
linkage along those lines.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.591 align:middle line:84%
The power companies themselves
do not want to invest.

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:55.459 align:middle line:84%
>> They want the
government to do it for them.

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Right! You got it!

00:44:56.994 --> 00:45:00.164 align:middle line:84%
And there's even a bit of a
cynical -- well, if it happens,

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:04.168 align:middle line:84%
we're all messed up anyhow,
and our stockbrokers --

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.736 align:middle line:84%
our stockholders
[multiple voices].

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.772 align:middle line:84%
>> The sad part about
it is, William,

00:45:07.772 --> 00:45:08.873 align:middle line:90%
as you will demonstrate...

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:09.874 align:middle line:90%
>> It's easy.

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.041 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do it.

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.009 align:middle line:90%
You can fix it.

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:12.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:15.146 align:middle line:90%
>> One more question here.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:15.679 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, William.

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.449 align:middle line:90%
Just a question.

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:90%
You spoke about hardening.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:23.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any methods that
a person could do practically

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:27.391 align:middle line:84%
to harden maybe generators
or any kind

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:31.428 align:middle line:84%
of personal items you might
need for the short term?

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:34.698 align:middle line:84%
>> It just so happens that
Mr. Noory here insisted

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:37.935 align:middle line:84%
that I bring something along
to demonstrate that with.

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And, yes.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.671 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll do that soon.

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And the -- again, I recommend
a number of different manuals.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.112 align:middle line:84%
You can find out there
how to prepare for EMP.

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:49.413 align:middle line:90%
Have back-up parts.

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:52.783 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everybody has
what's called a Faraday Cage

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:54.218 align:middle line:90%
in their house already.

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:55.719 align:middle line:90%
It's called a microwave oven.

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.521 align:middle line:90%
You take an old microwave oven.

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:58.956 align:middle line:84%
You can throw some
electronics in it.

00:45:58.956 --> 00:46:04.261 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's properly
grounded and it will survive.

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Hardening is not
all that difficult.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.233 align:middle line:84%
Now you might lose you
60-inch television screen,

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:11.101 align:middle line:84%
but there ain't going to be
any signals coming to that

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:90%
for some time to come.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.506 align:middle line:84%
But everybody should
have in their home,

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:20.244 align:middle line:84%
in a secure Farraday,
F-A-R-A-D-A-Y.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:84%
You can find instructions
for that on the Internet.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.849 align:middle line:90%
I have an emergency radio

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.517 align:middle line:84%
that runs off batteries
or hand-crank...

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:27.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Or solar.

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:30.154 align:middle line:84%
>> I have it inside
a Faraday bag.

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:33.324 align:middle line:84%
Great to pull out after an
event, so I'm up and running

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:36.861 align:middle line:90%
with news, and advice reports.

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:38.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that question.

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:42.132 align:middle line:90%
What are other countries doing?

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:44.935 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody doing
anything about this?

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh. Most of its classified.

00:46:46.337 --> 00:46:47.705 align:middle line:90%
Are they...

00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.807 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean they all have the
some possible outcome, right?

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:50.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:53.577 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun is the sun
and a nuke is a nuke.

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:55.946 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't answer that.

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.615 align:middle line:90%
And at conferences I have asked

00:46:57.615 --> 00:46:59.183 align:middle line:84%
or I would have --
what is Russia doing?

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.117 align:middle line:90%
What is China doing?

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:01.185 align:middle line:90%
>> What is China doing?

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:03.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Switzerland, I
understand, they're --

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:04.622 align:middle line:84%
well, Switzerland's
always on top of things.

00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:05.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:07.958 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:10.594 align:middle line:90%
And see, there as well, it's --

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:15.199 align:middle line:84%
I have very little regard
for the U.N., but they --

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.334 align:middle line:84%
if we're dealing with a
global situation like BME...

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:18.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is a global fix.

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:20.638 align:middle line:84%
>>...it should be a global
fix and we should be talking

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:84%
about how do we work
as a global community?

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.175 align:middle line:90%
One, to prepare, but secondly,

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.344 align:middle line:84%
think of the communications
breakdown and the potential

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.414 align:middle line:84%
for global war triggering
within a matter of days

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.182 align:middle line:84%
as people are scrambling
for resources...

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:33.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:34.251 align:middle line:90%
>> ...or saying, "Wait a minute.

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:36.854 align:middle line:84%
You did this to us --
we'regoing to watch on you."

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:37.955 align:middle line:90%
And the confusion...

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Total collapse.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:39.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:40.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do an experiment.

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:41.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:43.661 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you want to do?

00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.762 align:middle line:90%
>> It just so happens...

00:47:44.762 --> 00:47:47.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you told me
to bring my cell phone,

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:49.099 align:middle line:90%
and you have one, too.

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell me what
I'm supposed to do?

00:47:51.402 --> 00:47:53.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Trust us.

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:55.205 align:middle line:90%
We tested this before.

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:58.609 align:middle line:84%
If he calls me the
signal will come through.

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.845 align:middle line:90%
This is a Faraday bag.

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.748 align:middle line:84%
You can buy it online or
in any number of stores.

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:07.885 align:middle line:84%
I think I got this one
for about five bucks.

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:11.355 align:middle line:84%
You can get them as
big as six feet across.

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:12.923 align:middle line:90%
Nothing up my sleeve.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.926 align:middle line:90%
I got my cell phone in.

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:16.894 align:middle line:90%
Seal it.

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And now I'm to dial you up?

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Call me.

00:48:20.598 --> 00:48:21.765 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:22.499 align:middle line:84%
>> If it works, it's
going to be embarrassing.

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:23.567 align:middle line:90%
>> We will do that.

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.868 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it on speaker.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.673 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we'll hear
[phone ringing] me ringing.

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:30.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay [phone ringing].

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:33.811 align:middle line:90%
My phone's not ringing.

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:35.045 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's not [phone
ringing]...

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:35.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Well...

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:36.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you want to do...

00:48:36.814 --> 00:48:37.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoa, I knew it
was going to do that!

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:37.982 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:37.982 --> 00:48:39.083 align:middle line:90%
>> You opened the bag.

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:39.783 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have to open
the bag [phone ringing].

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:40.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah [phone ringing].

00:48:40.884 --> 00:48:42.519 align:middle line:84%
>> But the moment I
start to open the bag...

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:43.253 align:middle line:90%
>> There it is.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:46.123 align:middle line:90%
>> ...it came back on.

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.958 align:middle line:90%
That's $5.

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.693 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would
you do with this?

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:51.261 align:middle line:90%
>> What would I do with that?

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:54.765 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could put my head
in it if it was big enough,

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:58.535 align:middle line:84%
but this is a perfect thing for
what the one gentleman asked

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.604 align:middle line:90%
about -- precious electronics.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:01.805 align:middle line:90%
>> His ham radio?

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:03.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Ham radio.

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:07.611 align:middle line:84%
Oh, ham radios -- all ham radio
operators know, definitely --

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.480 align:middle line:84%
don't have your antenna
hooked up all the time

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.181 align:middle line:84%
because that will
feed a signal in.

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.617 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I had ham
radio equipment,

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.686 align:middle line:84%
I'd get one of those
six by six bags.

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:18.288 align:middle line:84%
They don't cost that
much relatively speaking.

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Stuff it all in there.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:23.927 align:middle line:84%
This can protect you from
all of your electronics,

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:26.797 align:middle line:90%
from a major CME/EMP event.

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:30.034 align:middle line:84%
And then when you know it's
safe to open them back up,

00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:32.503 align:middle line:84%
you pull them out and
you have your systems

00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:33.604 align:middle line:90%
up and running again.

00:49:33.604 --> 00:49:34.371 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.939 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the grid.

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you insulate the
grid from a pulse attack

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.212 align:middle line:90%
or a coronal mass ejection?

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do the analogy again

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.916 align:middle line:84%
of here's the generator,
there's your house.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.184 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:50.754 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a long
wire, all right?

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:54.124 align:middle line:84%
And if we took that wire
and put it all together,

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.759 align:middle line:84%
that's quite a few
square meters...

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:56.326 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:57.661 align:middle line:90%
>> ...of wire.

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:01.732 align:middle line:84%
When you have a discharge
coming down and the thousands

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:02.933 align:middle line:90%
of volts per square meter --

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:05.269 align:middle line:84%
we've all stood underneath
high tension lines.

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:07.237 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
hear them popping.

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:08.605 align:middle line:90%
>> You can hear the buzz.

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, imagine if somebody
get a million more volts popped

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.342 align:middle line:90%
out to them.

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.977 align:middle line:90%
You're gone, all right?

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:21.952 align:middle line:84%
But suppose we put breakers
at very regular intervals.

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:24.054 align:middle line:84%
>> So the whole thing
doesn't get it you mean.

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:27.257 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, the
breakers you got now --

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:32.129 align:middle line:84%
does it not seem that when
you buy that new hi-def wi TV,

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.364 align:middle line:84%
that the next day a lightning
bolt hits next to your house?

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:38.335 align:middle line:84%
>> And you go, darn, I should
have gotten the surge arrester.

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:42.106 align:middle line:84%
Current surge arresters
are not good enough...

00:50:42.106 --> 00:50:43.073 align:middle line:90%
>> For one of these.

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.475 align:middle line:90%
>> ...for one of these.

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:46.877 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got to get into
some technical stuff, but the...

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:48.312 align:middle line:84%
>> But is it doable
[multiple voices]?

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:49.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, it is.

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.448 align:middle line:90%
You can make surge protectors.

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:53.217 align:middle line:84%
>> How much do you
think it would cost

00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:57.254 align:middle line:84%
to completely insulate the
grid in the United States?

00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:02.893 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying that because what
we wasted giving it to banks

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:05.362 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
the bailout...

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Plus some groups in Egypt.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.599 align:middle line:90%
>> How much would it cost?

00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:11.201 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard figures
as low as $50 billion.

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is nothing in
the scheme of things.

00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:15.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Not compared to some
of the bills we've seen.

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:20.911 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the survival of my
daughter, it's for you and me

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.713 align:middle line:90%
and this audience to hear the --

00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:23.814 align:middle line:84%
what we've been throwing
[multiple voices] a billion

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.182 align:middle line:90%
dollars on.

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.451 align:middle line:84%
>> And to keep this country
intact and to minimize that kind

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:31.855 align:middle line:84%
of an attack or that kind of
a catastrophe from the sun,

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:35.058 align:middle line:84%
we would be a strong nation
if we were able to do this.

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:37.761 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not going
to be 100% protected,

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:41.231 align:middle line:84%
but if we can get a 50%
to 75% protection level

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.267 align:middle line:84%
on our distribution
and transportation

00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:44.434 align:middle line:90%
and control systems...

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:45.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:48.238 align:middle line:84%
>> ...casualty figure would go
from -- think of it, George --

00:51:48.238 --> 00:51:52.876 align:middle line:84%
270 million Americans
dead in a year.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:57.681 align:middle line:84%
People wonder how the
figures seem so absurd.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember Dr. Pry -- he's
quite an expert on this --

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.718 align:middle line:90%
said, "The old nuclear war

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.520 align:middle line:84%
with the Russians would
have been more humane."

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.489 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when
you buy insurance...

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.557 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good one.

00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:08.425 align:middle line:84%
>> ...auto insurance,
house insurance...

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:12.829 align:middle line:84%
>> ...initially you think
what a waste of money...

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Until you need it.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.032 align:middle line:90%
>> ...until you need it.

00:52:15.032 --> 00:52:19.536 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you buy
insurance is if you need it.

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:22.539 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this a great
insurance policy?

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Insulate the grid

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Would a bank let you
buy a house without...

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Without.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:27.744 align:middle line:90%
>> ...insurance?

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.214 align:middle line:90%
>> And...

00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:31.715 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're pushing
earthquake insurance now

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.116 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:34.952 align:middle line:84%
They know one day
they're going to get hit

00:52:34.952 --> 00:52:38.455 align:middle line:84%
and they want you
covered and protected.

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:40.357 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we just
do it as a nation?

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:43.393 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't a presidential
candidate, when he's running --

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:45.963 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone has ever
addressed this in a campaign.

00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:47.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Two candidates have.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:48.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Ron Paul?

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:49.433 align:middle line:90%
>> And Newt Gingrich.

00:52:49.433 --> 00:52:50.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:53.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the only two candidates
who talked about it on -- yes...

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.439 align:middle line:84%
>> But the media
scoffed right over it.

00:52:55.439 --> 00:52:57.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. Let me give
you a different analogy.

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.676 align:middle line:84%
I just bought a car for my
daughter a couple of years ago.

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:84%
Of course I went
out and got a car

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.145 align:middle line:90%
with a five star safety rating.

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:03.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:05.649 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of father would
I be if I'm standing there

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.618 align:middle line:84%
and the dealer says,
"Okay, the car is 12,000.

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:08.886 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, do me a favor.

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Take the airbags out.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:11.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Take the collapsible
column here.

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:12.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Save me a little bit here.

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.424 align:middle line:84%
>> You can save me a
couple of thousand bucks

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:84%
if you get rid of
all this stuff.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.996 align:middle line:90%
What kind of father would I be?

00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:20.897 align:middle line:90%
I'm no, load it all in.

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:23.634 align:middle line:84%
So for the cost of getting
a safe car for my daughter,

00:53:23.634 --> 00:53:27.437 align:middle line:84%
if we multiply that out across
the entire United States

00:53:27.437 --> 00:53:30.607 align:middle line:84%
to every household, we
would have a secure grid

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:33.210 align:middle line:84%
which would protect my
daughter and your kids

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.145 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's grandchildren.

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:38.448 align:middle line:84%
>> I would create it as
a tax, not on people,

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:90%
but on these companies...

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.319 align:middle line:90%
>> ...that provide the power.

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.553 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
"Look, you're going

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.555 align:middle line:90%
to amortize this over 20 years."

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.357 align:middle line:84%
>> "But you're going
to pay for this."

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:50.594 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going to do
this as a nation to insulate

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.362 align:middle line:90%
and protect this country.

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:56.867 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would be
brilliant because one day one

00:53:56.867 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of these two possibilities
is going to occur.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.074 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of Admiral Halsey
coming into Pearl Harbor

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:07.477 align:middle line:84%
on the evening of December
7th looking at the wreckage

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:13.083 align:middle line:84%
of the American fleet with
his ship, the Enterprise --

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.786 align:middle line:84%
description of the bodies
floating in the bay,

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:17.621 align:middle line:90%
being pushed aside by this boat.

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:19.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:22.726 align:middle line:84%
>> And I cannot quote exactly
what Admiral Halsey said he was

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.795 align:middle line:84%
going to do before
this was done.

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:27.564 align:middle line:84%
44 months later he was there
to take their surrender

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:31.568 align:middle line:84%
in Tokyo Harbor with a
thousand ships behind him.

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:33.704 align:middle line:84%
We will not have that
opportunity again

00:54:33.704 --> 00:54:34.771 align:middle line:90%
if we get hit by an EMP.

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:38.175 align:middle line:84%
The game is over in
the first second.

00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:40.777 align:middle line:90%
>> If the sun sends off a CME...

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:41.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> ...we've got a couple
days on that one, right?

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Fortunately, a CME moves
slower than the speed of light.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.052 align:middle line:84%
I was up at Goddard
Labs last year talking

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:51.088 align:middle line:90%
with their solar experts.

00:54:51.088 --> 00:54:52.689 align:middle line:90%
Has a remarkable crew.

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.924 align:middle line:84%
They're dedicate
-- I asked them,

00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:57.027 align:middle line:84%
"If the big one is coming,
what do you guys do?"

00:54:57.027 --> 00:55:00.397 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Our duty is
to be here and keep putting

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.133 align:middle line:84%
out the information as long
as possible until it hits."

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.634 align:middle line:90%
These are our top solar experts.

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:05.802 align:middle line:90%
I said, "And then what?"

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.304 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've had
episodes already.

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.405 align:middle line:90%
I've received notices...

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.975 align:middle line:84%
>> ...during my show that
we might have disruption

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:15.245 align:middle line:84%
with broadcasting
from smaller flares...

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:15.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:16.947 align:middle line:90%
>> ...that take off.

00:55:16.947 --> 00:55:18.482 align:middle line:84%
So the big ones, you
know, we have a --

00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:21.184 align:middle line:84%
we'd have two days to
do a little preparing.

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:23.587 align:middle line:84%
But that's why we should
be preparing right now.

00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:26.723 align:middle line:84%
>> And see, right there you
hit another point: preparing.

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We have not run even a
simulation drill, let alone --

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.629 align:middle line:90%
I remember one candidate saying,

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.664 align:middle line:84%
"We should get a
moderate size town

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:90%
in America to do a simulation."

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Shut the power down.

00:55:37.401 --> 00:55:38.769 align:middle line:84%
>> ...to shut the
whole grid down...

00:55:38.769 --> 00:55:42.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And have the media
there, everybody recording this,

00:55:42.606 --> 00:55:47.043 align:middle line:84%
showing you what happens to
life if power's down for a --

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.311 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, I would take care

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:50.614 align:middle line:84%
of the hospitals and
things like that.

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:55.085 align:middle line:84%
But I would monitor people
almost like  The Truman Show.

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:58.522 align:middle line:84%
And just watch them and how
they live, and how they react,

00:55:58.522 --> 00:55:59.923 align:middle line:90%
while this is going on.

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:02.225 align:middle line:84%
And I think it would
be startling...

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I think anybody...

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:05.562 align:middle line:84%
>> ...old enough
in the audience --

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:08.131 align:middle line:84%
because I remember just before
the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:10.634 align:middle line:84%
in [inaudible] where
we did simulate.

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:11.868 align:middle line:90%
>> We used to have those...

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Duck and cover.

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.006 align:middle line:84%
>> ...those duck and cover
alerts in school and everything

00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:18.975 align:middle line:84%
and we got to sit down, or
go to a fallout shelter.

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:19.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.378 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember my
neighbor growing

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:22.979 align:middle line:84%
up in Dearborn Heights,
Michigan.

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.382 align:middle line:84%
He built a fallout
shelter in his basement,

00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.384 align:middle line:90%
and everybody laughed at him.

00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.853 align:middle line:90%
But whenever there was tension,

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:31.755 align:middle line:84%
everybody wanted
to go down there.

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember the
Twilight Zone  episode?

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:34.124 align:middle line:90%
>> It was one of the greatest.

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah, yes.

00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:36.726 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the greatest.

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:37.794 align:middle line:90%
Scary times.

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we are in scary times.

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:40.630 align:middle line:90%
But again, I believe we

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.934 align:middle line:84%
as Americans can
transcend scary times.

00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:46.903 align:middle line:84%
We should not be
afraid of the future.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.473 align:middle line:84%
We should be embracing
the challenge

00:56:49.473 --> 00:56:51.842 align:middle line:84%
and getting ready
beforehand because, in fact,

00:56:51.842 --> 00:56:53.009 align:middle line:90%
the act of getting ready

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:55.011 align:middle line:84%
for it can very well
prevent it from happening.

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Instant poll.

00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:57.747 align:middle line:84%
How many people think we
should spend the money

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.884 align:middle line:84%
and insulate the grid even
though it's $50 million?

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:01.852 align:middle line:90%
Almost universal.

00:57:01.852 --> 00:57:02.619 align:middle line:90%
It probably is.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.887 align:middle line:90%
Almost everybody did that.

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:08.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if it never happens,
what great peace of mind.

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:11.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever have your
house insurance lapse

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:13.129 align:middle line:84%
and you know there's a
hurricane wandering above?

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.498 align:middle line:84%
>> No, thank god,
I didn't have that.

00:57:14.498 --> 00:57:17.133 align:middle line:84%
>> That happened to me once,
and I'm staring at the ceiling.

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.401 align:middle line:90%
There was no peace of mind

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.071 align:middle line:84%
until I did get the insurance
policy straightened out.

00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:24.741 align:middle line:84%
We only need that insurance
policy the day after,

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.076 align:middle line:90%
but if you don't have it...

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:26.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:26.877 --> 00:57:27.711 align:middle line:90%
>> ...and you're driving...

00:57:27.711 --> 00:57:28.912 align:middle line:90%
>> You're up the creek.

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all American
should realize we need an

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.381 align:middle line:90%
insurance policy.

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:32.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we do.

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.618 align:middle line:84%
And other countries I
think would follow suit...

00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:35.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:36.553 align:middle line:90%
>> ...if they saw what we did.

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.855 align:middle line:84%
>> And it might even
dissuade the lunatics,

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.223 align:middle line:90%
the outright lunatics in Iran

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and North Korea --
don't even try it.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. And then
the next problem is,

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:49.399 align:middle line:84%
since we've taken care of the
grid, now we've got to take care

00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:54.104 align:middle line:84%
of their ability to
launch to hit us on land.

00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:55.405 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a foreign
policy and that's...

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.273 align:middle line:90%
>> That's another issue.

00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:58.508 align:middle line:90%
>> ...we address aggressively.

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is another issue.

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:31.074 align:middle line:90%
Look up EMP.

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.878 align:middle line:84%
Look up a site by a remarkable
gentleman named Rollins who puts

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.379 align:middle line:90%
out a lot of information.

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:39.616 align:middle line:84%
The information is out there
and it's spreading like crazy

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:42.519 align:middle line:84%
in the last year or two
which gives me optimism.

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:43.753 align:middle line:90%

William, I hope we never
have this happen to us,

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:56.700 align:middle line:84%
but I got to tell you, when it
does, the first thing I'll think

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.069 align:middle line:90%
about is your book and you

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:04.307 align:middle line:84%
because you were the first
person to publically come out

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:06.776 align:middle line:84%
and really talk about
the dangers of this.

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:09.512 align:middle line:84%
Others are doing it
now, as you know.

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:11.715 align:middle line:84%
Michael Maloof is
coming out with his...

00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:12.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.083 align:middle line:90%
>> ...and things like that.

00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Good book.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.151 align:middle line:90%
That is a good book.

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:18.622 align:middle line:84%
>> They're starting to pick up
on what you started and, again,

00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:21.992 align:middle line:84%
I hope to God, we never have
to worry about it but, you now,

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:24.294 align:middle line:90%
you've painted a picture for us,

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:26.696 align:middle line:84%
a blueprint on what
we should do.

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:29.599 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope somebody
in a presidential campaign,

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:33.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe in 2016, comes forward
and says, "You know what?

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.805 align:middle line:84%
We wasted money on
bailouts, you know.

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:39.175 align:middle line:84%
We gave out $700
billion dollars,

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.610 align:middle line:90%
a trillion billion dollars.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.914 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend 50
measly billion dollars

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.650 align:middle line:90%
and protect America.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.418 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need to do.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.353 align:middle line:84%

the coin, George, you were one

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of the first to call me up
