>>GEORGE NOORY: Is there
an underlying agenda here?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON BICKFORD: I do believe
that if there is an agenda,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:84%
it's something that has more
of a spiritual explanation.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That we're maybe
tapping into a higher

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:90%
self or a universal mind.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a saying in
the Gospel of Thomas

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
where Christ says, let
one seek until one finds.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
When you find,
you'll be troubled.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
After you're troubled, you
will be amazed or in awe,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and then you will
reign over all.

>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:10%
Jason James Bickford with
us, an esoteric researcher,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
visual artist, and
independent media producer.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Jason, welcome to the program.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.668 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly is
an esoteric researcher?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: Well, I
found myself always

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:10%
to be a curious person
interested in science.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:10%
I had an aptitude
in mathematics,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
and I gravitated towards
that when I was in school.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:10%
I was also a creative person
with an active imagination.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:10%
I love to make visual art.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was,
the worlds were merging,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, some time
in high school.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you personally?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: For me personally, I
had maybe a bit of a contrarian

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%
or skepticism in my nature.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:10%
So I would question the way
the world was, and at times, I

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:10%
found my creative imagination
explaining things better

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:10%
than some of the narratives that
I was getting from particularly

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:10%
the materialist,
scientific worldview that I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:10%
had held at the time.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So I would have
identified myself

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
as an atheist, a skeptic,
and a materialist.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, my imagination
and my love for art,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
literature, poetry, pointed
me in a different direction.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
there was something

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
true to the core of
the creative work

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that I was engaged with
that wasn't explained

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
by the materialist background
that I had immersed myself in.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, I began looking
for alternative answers.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel like
you were missing something?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: I did, yes.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It's curious that I
found myself as maybe

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a snarky skeptic.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I was mad at God but also
didn't believe in a God.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
There was other kinds of
cognitive dissonance embedded

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
in my two loves that didn't
seem compatible for a while.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mad at God, but
you didn't believe in God.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Yes.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
those two combine?

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, I think
the world, as I entered

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
adolescence, didn't seem to be
the way I expected it to be,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.593 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking
for someone to blame.

00:02:57.593 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
consider yourself a Gnostic

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
spiritualist?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Now I would say
that I'm a Gnostic Christian.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And exactly
what is that?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, the
Gnostics were a part

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
of early Christian movements.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Theologians and
scholars have found

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that there was a great
variety of Christian movements

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
in the early centuries, and
the Gnostics took a kind of--

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
well, a skeptic look at the
dogma of the church, which

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
tried to label them heretics.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With an
open mind, though?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Yes, they
had an open mind.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --open mind?

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: They saw that
the world they embodied

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:10%
was open for
interpretation and also

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:10%
a place for what I would call
co-creation, in which allegory

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:10%
and parables embedded
in the scriptures

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:10%
were entry points into a kind
of co-creative participation

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:10%
that was frowned upon.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics felt that
there was a spirituality

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to be gained on a one-on-one
basis that was outside

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of the dogmatic hierarchy of
a state-sponsored, militarized

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:90%
church.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think the label of
heretics came because they--

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.714 align:middle line:90%
well, you can't herd cats.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.389 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Yeah.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.829 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics were kind of
like spiritual cat people.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They preferred to have their
experiences one-on-one.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Although they were
active in the church,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
they would often interpret
some of the allegory symbolism

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:90%
in their own personal way.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was hard to pick
out in the early church

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:84%
who was a Gnostic,
and who was not.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
There was kind of like a
precursor to the witch hunts.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You produced a clip
of predictive programming

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.538 align:middle line:84%
that was done in Hollywood,
and it's pretty fascinating.

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: I'd like
to introduce you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:10%
to the concept of precognition
in the film, "Back

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:10%
to the Future," specifically
warnings of terrorism

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:10%
embedded in co-creation.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, the infamous clock
tower features prominently

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:10%
in the plot of the
film, and Marty McFly,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:10%
at the beginning of
the film, is urged

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.317 align:middle line:10%
to donate to save
the clock tower.

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:10%
They're thinking of
getting rid of it.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:10%
It was struck by
lightning in the '50s.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:10%
So Marty goes back 30 years
from the '80s to the '50s.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:10%
And he's trying to help Doc
Brown finish a time machine,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:10%
so that he can get back home.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:10%
He wants to tell Doc Brown about
what's going on 30 years ahead

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:10%
in the 1980s.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you
about the future,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:10%
he yells to Doc
Brown at the tower.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:10%
Now in this scene, after
Marty travels through time,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:10%
right in front of the
theater on the marquee,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:10%
it says, the atomic kid.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:10%
Above that, we could read
this symbolically as Beantown,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:10%
and that's a
nickname for Boston.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:10%
So I'm reminded of the
Boston Marathon bombing.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:10%
There's a finish line where
Marty disappears in a blast.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:10%
We've got the atomic head
finish line, Beantown,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:10%
7/7 on the ground, as well as
a symbolic 9/11 Western Auto.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:10%
So I'm thinking the West being
West of the UK, the London

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:10%
underground, taxicabs on fire.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:10%
So symbolically, we have
the underground taxi

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:10%
or the subway of 7/7 attack
above and to the West.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:10%
We have Western Auto
as a number nine

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:10%
and then the 11, so that's 9/11.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:10%
And in the background
later on is Beantown.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:10%
Boston Marathon at the
finish line of this event.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:10%
That's symbolically three
terror events predicted

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:10%
in one scene of the film.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:10%
If it was just that
one scene, I would

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:10%
think it's a weird coincidence,
but the film and the trilogy

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:10%
are loaded with 9/11
symbolism and other forms

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:10%
of precognition.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:10%
This is just a short sample,
but pictographically,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:10%
through icons, through
symbols, as well as

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:10%
through the plot points.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:10%
Like here, Doc Brown is murdered
by Middle Eastern extremists.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:10%
So in a number of
different ways,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:10%
this film is letting us know
that it's 30 years ahead.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:10%
Just like Marty McFly's
warning to Doc Brown,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you
about the future,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:10%
the film is screaming
to us, I have

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:10%
to tell you about the future.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that movie.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, these symbols
that were in there

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
about things that would
happen eventually.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
How did Hollywood
know about this?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.577 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just accidental?

00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I first
thought that there

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
might be an intent behind
this, and my understanding

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of how this symbolism
and precognition works

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
has expanded over the years.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there's
something I would refer

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to as a co-creative faculty in
which human beings are tapping

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.902 align:middle line:90%
into information, data--

00:07:38.902 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
might not even know it?

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: They might
not even know it.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
you have to have

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
a conscious, articulated
knowledge that you're

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
putting this kind of symbolism
in any kind of creative work.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We can find it in artwork,
literature, poetry,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
particularly in Hollywood.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the
entire crew or just Bob Gale

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Zemeckis,
who made the film,

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
were consciously
trying to warn us.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that some
people have a little bit more

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of a faculty with precognition,
and they can unconsciously--

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say it maps onto what
Carl Jung was talking about,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:90%
the collective unconscious.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
There's possibly
intelligence that we're

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
tapping into that can
manifest itself in symbol

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and as well as story
and plot points.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
That was just a taste
of it, but the internet

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
was abuzz in the wake of
the events of September

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
11th in 2001 with
media across the board

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
from comic books, and
cartoons, and album cover art,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and Hollywood.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're familiar
with the show, "The X-Files."

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:90%
in 2001, there was a spinoff.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a spinoff show with
characters from "The X-Files"

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
called "The Lone Gunman,"
and in their pilot episode,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the plot of the show was
terrorists hijack a plane

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and fly it into
the trade towers.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And that aired, I believe,
six months before the events,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and, obviously, conspiracy
theorists go crazy

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of information.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
don't know, Jason,

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
if that film gave the
terrorists the idea.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, right?

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: It's
really something

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:90%
we can only speculate about.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
my work is about,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to make sense of various
forms of precognition embedded

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
in media, and how
it can come about.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
unified code theory?

00:09:26.037 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So the
unified code theory

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
is a name I've given to a
group of intellectual ideas

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
explain phenomenon

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
like predictive programming,
and how it works.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I was
very much interested

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:90%
in science and mathematics.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I had an aptitude for
pattern recognition,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and probabilities,
and statistics.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, I've tried to take all
of these seemingly disparate

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
lines of thinking and come up
with a kind of holistic theory

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
as to what the source
of this information

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is that could provide
this precognition,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and how it manifests
itself in what I would

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
call co-creative human output.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an
underlining agenda here?

00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: At first,
I was a little bit more

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:84%
prone to the conspiracy
theory thinking

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a
nefarious agenda that

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
involved a very large network of
people with a conscious intent.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, I've come to
realize that to pull

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that off seems almost
impossible, and what I do--

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
although I do believe there's
corruption in the world.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:10%
I believe that
much of this comes

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:10%
from something
that has more to do

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:10%
with tapping into information.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:10%
Very often, artists
and creators are,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:10%
let's say, getting
inspiration, and they

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:10%
don't have a fully
articulated explanation

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:10%
for why did you choose this,
or that, or the other thing?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that if
there is an agenda,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
it's something that has more
of a spiritual explanation.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
That we're maybe tapping into a
higher self or a universal mind

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that exists outside of
our physical limitations

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of time and space.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, could
access future outcomes

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:90%
or potentialities.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
research, where does God

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:90%
come into this picture?

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, I believe
in the Christian concept

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that God is
ultimately ineffable.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So at times, the less I say
about God's intent is maybe

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
best.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
However, if I see God
as a creative force that

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is behind the universe,
I don't see God

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
as the proverbial
blind watchmaker who

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
set up a mechanized universe.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And then just set it in
motion, and we're off

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
on a spinning marble.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:90%
in nowhere.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I see God as an intelligence
and a creative force

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that is consciously breathing
life into our world,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and I don't see the
world as cold matter

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
but more as something
that's generated

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:90%
from our consciousness.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So you and I are
collectively all

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
of us generating the
world that we exist in,

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's more like an
interactive lucid dream

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
world in which
we're participating

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
with a creative faculty
that's ultimately

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
mysterious but
leaves fingerprints

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, what is the
Christian simulation theory?

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I kind of came up
with some ideas that I thought

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
were original only to
find that Philip K Dick

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s, the famous
science fiction writer--

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Genius.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Great writer.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: He
floated the concept

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of proto-simulation
theory existence,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
but he also filtered it
through an understanding

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
of Christian
scripture in which he

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
felt that we're in
an interactive world

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
in which we're kind of like
avatars of a higher self.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That's like a video
game character,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's a higher
self at the controls.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.323 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of in a choose
your own adventure novel.

00:13:00.323 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who made the
video game, right?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD:
Ultimately, that might

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
be something that isn't answered
for us in our physical lives.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
that we can learn

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
creative force behind things

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
by taking a look
at what's created.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precognition.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.337 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate
to what you do?

00:13:18.337 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, there's
been a lot of interesting work

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:90%
in precognition.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:10%
It's been proven that
humans and some animals

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:10%
have a kind of ability to know
before they know things that

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:10%
happen from predictive dreams.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
You even mentioned in an
interview with Julia Mossbridge

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that your daughter had a
precognitive dream that

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:84%
seemed to heavily
embed symbolism

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.472 align:middle line:84%
for the events of
September 11th.

00:13:49.472 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a matter
of fact, let's

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
take a look at a clip
with Julia Mossbridge.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:10%
My daughter had a feeling
of 9/11 during 2001.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:10%
She called me up one day
before it happened and said,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:10%
dad, I just had this
feeling, this dream

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:10%
that I was walking
in this major city,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:10%
and dust particles are
coming down on me like crazy.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:10%
And I could look
down at my feet,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:10%
and I was in six inches of ash.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:10%
What do you think that was?

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking, gosh, is there
a volcano around a major city?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was in Europe.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what it was,
and then two weeks later, she

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:10%
calls me up in the
morning and said,

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:10%
dad, dad-- because I work late.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:10%
Wake up.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Turn on your television.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:10%
You won't believe this.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:10%
And I did and saw the planes
hitting one of the towers.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:10%
And then we both
realized her dream

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:10%
was that because as we looked
at the pictures of the rubble

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:10%
coming down, and the
ash floating down,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:10%
and firemen in six
inches of this stuff,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:10%
that's what she was in.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.305 align:middle line:10%
She saw that.

00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:10%
How does that happen?

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:10%
Now that's precognition.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:10%
>>JULIA MOSSBRIDGE: So what
we know about precognition

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:10%
is that decades of
scientific evidence

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:10%
show that it does happen
at a rate above chance,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:10%
and the question
of how it happens

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:10%
is what I'm pursuing in my life.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so it's not
known, and that's

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:10%
what I'm trying to figure out.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:10%
So I can't answer
that question, but I

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:10%
can say that there's something
that has to do with the mind.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:10%
And we often think
of the mind as

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:10%
being exactly
equal to the brain,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:10%
but that's sort of
the mainstream view.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And yet, there's many
reasons as you know to not

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.925 align:middle line:10%
think that that's the case.

00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:10%
So there's many reasons
to think that there's

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:10%
this thing called mind that
is different from the body.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:10%
And it relates to the body,
but it's not in there.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And this thing
called mind, I think,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have a sense
of time the way

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:10%
the body has a sense of time.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So this thing that we call our
mind, it doesn't have any mass.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't take up space.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't need energy.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:10%
It's informational.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:10%
It's like information, and so,
it can be anywhere in time.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:10%
So it can spend its whole
existence on Thursday

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:10%
at 2:00 PM.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, think of this as
Wi-Fi, and it's out there.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:10%
You don't see it,
but it's there.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:10%
But we tap into it.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that a little
possibility that when

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:10%
we tap into precognition
that it's out there?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Wherever it is, and
whatever it might be?

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:10%
But we hit the
wireless internet,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:10%
and we connect with it.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
maybe so, and that

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.658 align:middle line:10%
would explain why you
see these oscillations

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:10%
in performance even
of the people who

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:10%
are very, very skilled.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:10%
It just never straight line.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And so, it almost reminds
me of radio waves.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not
surprising that we

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:10%
created radios that use
radio waves if, in fact, we

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:10%
are tapping into
something like that.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My daughter
subsequently told me, Jason,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that she knew she was in
New York during that dream.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It's truly remarkable.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: It is.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It's mysterious.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there's
a number of people

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
like Ms. Mossbridge
and others that

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
are looking into human's
capacity for precognition,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that there's
hard science, as well

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual
concepts, that can be

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
merged in a holistic vision of
what's exactly going on here.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you tell
us about Owen Barfield

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and his thoughts
of consciousness?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So Owen Barfield
coined this term fossils

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
He was known as one
of the inklings.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
He was a good friend of
JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They met in a pub
out in Cambridge,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and Owen Barfield's
actually credited

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
with being the friend, one
of the best friends of CS

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Lewis, a famous Christian
apologist who began his college

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
education as a skeptic
and an atheist.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.227 align:middle line:90%
And it was Owen Barfield who--

00:17:57.227 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then changed.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Owen Barfield
convinced CS Lewis

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that the mythologies and
the literature that he

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
was in love with and the
power of the imagination

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
was not necessarily in conflict
with his scientific worldview.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And he helped him embrace
what would later become

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
his Christian understanding.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The fossils of
consciousness is a term

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that Owen Barfield used to
describe our relationship

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
with language, and it was
Owen Barfield's belief

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that if we look at etymology
and the relationship

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that, say, the ancient Hebrews
or the Greeks who wrote the New

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Testament had, their
relationship with language

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
described a world that revealed
their change in consciousness.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
There was an evolution
in our consciousness,

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and the etymology
and use of language

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is like a fossil or a remnant of
a former type of consciousness

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
that we had.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one example.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew word for wind,
and spirit, and breath

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:90%
is all one word.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:10%
It's ruach, and it's
the same in Greek.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:10%
The word is pneuma.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pneuma.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: And the
people that were writing

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:10%
either the Old Testament
or the New Testament,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:10%
when they would describe
a wind blowing, they

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:10%
had an understanding
that this was not

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:10%
just material floating
through the air in just

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:10%
a materialist view.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But that there was this holistic
and spiritual understanding

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of a relationship
with the world.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
God was seen as in the
Old Testament embodied

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in Mount Zion.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
It was an external force
that we interacted with,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and this becomes an interior
relationship in the New

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Testament through Jesus.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
breathing the spirit

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
or feeling the wind
breath, it's part

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of a co-creative and
participatory experience

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in a world that's
interconnected.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost some
of that connection,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and now we have different
words for these things that

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:90%
were seen as more unified.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
Book of Revelation,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the
Mark of the Beast 666.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Yes.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're told in
the Book of Revelation

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
that the number of Man and
the number of Beast is 666.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:10%
So I found some
interesting patterns

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:10%
that overlap with
biological chemistry here

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and an understanding of
spirits in the underworld.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, the carbon atom,
when it's stable,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:10%
has six protons, six
neutrons, and six electrons.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a world
where all living organisms

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
are carbon-based
life forms, so we

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
could say that the number of
Man and the number of Best

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is six protons, six
neutrons, six electrons.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:90%
The carbon atom.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And now, the Jews
had an understanding

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
of not so much a Hell,
but an underworld

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.852 align:middle line:84%
where spirits resided until
a judgment was enacted.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lower plane?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: And that
was called the Sheol,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's very often illustrated
by the ancient Hebrews

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
as this dark pit
under the ground.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, we live in a world
in which we have some problems

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:90%
with fossil fuel usage.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
We're drilling down
into the underground

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
to pull up this black tar,
which is largely carbon,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're burning it up and
spewing it into the atmosphere.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a world now that's
undergoing a cultural climate

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:84%
change, and this could be
seen as symbolically mapping

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
onto the Mark of
the Beast, or 666,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
being removed from the Sheol
and put into the atmosphere.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Which we breathe through
our breath, which

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is known as pneuma or
ruach, which is spirit.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So Owen Barfield would
have a field day with this.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rupert Sheldrake
talks about morphogenic fields.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Regina Meredith
interviewed him on Gaia,

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.178 align:middle line:90%
and they discussed that.

00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RUPERT SHELDRAKE:
The morphogenetic field

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:90%
contains attractors.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That's one way in
which the fields work.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
They contain, as it
were, future goals.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So the morphogenetic field
contains the plan or form

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of the mature frog,
and when the baby

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
frog-- the tadpole's
turning into a baby frog,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
it's being attracted
towards that form.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's how the field works.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
static blueprint.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's more like an
attractor towards

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.712 align:middle line:90%
a particular final form.

00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
And within this,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.712 align:middle line:10%
when you're looking at it from
more of a universal principle,

00:22:20.712 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:10%
it appears that cosmically,
all of these expressions

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:10%
have a tendency toward
establishing order.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELDRAKE: Yes, all these
what we see in evolution

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is the appearance of
more and more order.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
At the moment of
the Big Bang, there

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
was just an amorphous mass
of energy and potentiality.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
There was no structure.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It was far too hot.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And as the universe
expands and cools,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
more structures and
forms become possible.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, the
amount of structure you get

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
is less when it's hotter
and more when It's cooler.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:10%
A snowflake has more
structure than water vapor

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:10%
in the atmosphere.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So as you cool things down,
as the universe cooled,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:90%
more structure became possible.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:10%
What it means in effect
is that every species

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:10%
has a collective memory.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:10%
Every individual draws
upon it and tunes into it,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:10%
and it's a collective
memory of form

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:10%
involved in shaping the embryo
and the growth of the animal

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:10%
or plant.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And also, collective
memory of behavior

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:10%
in the case of animals, which
underlies their instincts.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:10%
Instincts are like
habits of the species.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:10%
A young spider can spin
a web without having

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:10%
to learn it, or go to web
workshops, or anything.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:10%
Just instinctively,
it knows what

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:10%
to do without any
training, and it's

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:10%
a kind of memory of the
webs that its ancestors

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:10%
have spun before.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:10%
So that's the theory
in a nutshell,

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:10%
and it's rather like Jung's idea
of the collective unconscious

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:10%
as a collective human memory.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:10%
And it's not just organisms.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:10%
This applies to crystals, too.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:10%
It means that when
compounds crystallize

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:10%
for the first time, the
more often they crystallize,

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:10%
the easier the crystals
should get to form.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:10%
It's easier to make them,
and that's actually true.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.465 align:middle line:10%
It also means in the
realm of animal behavior,

00:24:14.465 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:10%
if animals learn a new trick
in one place like rats,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.647 align:middle line:10%
if they learn a new
trick in London,

00:24:19.647 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:10%
then rats all over the world
should learn the same thing

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:10%
quicker thereafter just because
the rats here have learned it.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:10%
So this theory makes
quite a few predictions.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:10%
Many of them have been
tested, and the tests

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:10%
suggest it's really happening.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's controversial,
obviously,

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's not the way
most scientists think.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
deep thinker, Jason.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Deep thinker.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Now, Dr. Sheldrake
has been putting forth

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
these ideas about
morphic resonance

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
in the morphogenetic field
for over 40 years now.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And a number of skeptics
have tried to debunk them,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.477 align:middle line:90%
and they haven't had any luck.

00:24:56.477 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:90%
They haven't had any luck.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't do it.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:84%
This information, how do we
use it in our day-to-day life/

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well,
I was fascinated

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to find from Dr. Sheldrake
that DNA doesn't have body

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:90%
plans for animals and humans.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:10%
It's more of a parts list.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And it almost seems
like not only are there

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
patterns in memory, but
there's an interactive field

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that could be the
source of adaptation

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
as well as the body
plan development.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I see this as
a road into what

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I call the co-creative
faculty, the source

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of the co-creative
faculty, and precognition.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that Sheldrake's ideas
and Julia Mossbridge's ideas,

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomenon of
patterns and precognition

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
embedded in predictive
programming and artwork

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
are all intrinsically
related and point

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.663 align:middle line:90%
to one source of intelligence.

00:25:52.663 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a bigger picture

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:90%
here that we're not seeing?

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, I think the
bigger picture's becoming more

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
emergent, and I see that
thinkers like Sheldrake are

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
moving out of the fringe and
are gradually becoming more--

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:90%
are becoming taken seriously.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a large number of
biologists, mathematicians,

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and genomists now that
question the validity

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of Darwinian evolution and
see something else going on.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that adaptations,
evolution, creation,

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
precognition are all
evidences of interaction

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
with what may exist and interact
with us through what Sheldrake

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
describes as the
morphogenetic field.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we train
people for precognition?

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: It seems like
certainly, some people

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:84%
have more of a conscious
ability to tap into that.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there
are both scientific methods

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual methods
to become more

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to that source of
intelligence that's mysterious.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once as an individual
you understand all this,

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
what do you see for
the big picture?

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe
that we can collectively--

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say, put my
trust in any one person

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
with precognition, and
then base my life on that.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
collectively, we

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.970 align:middle line:84%
can take a look at patterns
emergent in dreams, artwork,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
even Hollywood
films and map those

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
onto larger patterns
that could inform

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:90%
the way we live our lives.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.195 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's also a
spiritual component to this

00:27:41.195 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:90%
that can be rather reassuring.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:27:45.453 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, there's a
saying in the Gospel of Thomas

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that I like, a Gnostic
text, where Christ says,

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:90%
let one seek until one finds.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:84%
When you find,
you'll be troubled.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:84%
After you're troubled, you
will be amazed or in awe,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and then you will
reign over all.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I take this to be
similar to a pattern that's

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
embedded in Dante's
"Divine Comedy"

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
where an individual leaves
the blissfully ignorant life

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and travels into
inferno, and purgatory,

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and on into paradise.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I see sometimes a spiritual
awakening or a confrontation

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
with cognitive dissonance can
cause people to be troubled.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The world isn't quite
what I thought it was,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and at first, this can bring up
a lot of unanswered questions

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that trouble someone that's
curious and investigative

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:90%
like myself.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
reassurance in that there

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a type of
intelligence that's benevolent

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and a faculty with communicating
with something like the higher

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
self or the higher mind that
wants what's best for us.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I think of that
simulation theory

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that Philip K Dick
talked about as being

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
like a choose your
own adventure novel,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and we have potential outcomes.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately in the story of
our life that we're living out,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.100 align:middle line:84%
there's many different
potentialities.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we interact holistically
and in a serious way

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
with this source of the
co-creative faculty,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
we can choose a better
life for ourselves

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
by coming into mindfulness with
what this is trying to tell us.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems like
we're being warned,

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:90%
and we're being given advice.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're entering
into an age where

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
let's say people are concerned
about a global pandemic,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're covering
up our mouths.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.245 align:middle line:90%
We're blocking our breath.

00:29:42.245 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The symbolic language here would
be, we've got a bad breath.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:90%
We've got a bad spirit.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:90%
The bad ruach, a bad pneuma.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's troubling, but
it's also empowering.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
The first step to
solving a problem

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is understanding
what the problem is,

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that it's not
just scientific and material,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.115 align:middle line:90%
but a spiritual problem.

00:30:03.115 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason,
you had mentioned

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:90%
artwork tied into some of this.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:90%
How does that relate?

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, the
predictive programming

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
doesn't just appear in Hollywood
productions or television.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I have found evidence that
Renaissance artists, as well as

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
artists as recent
as 20th century

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
illustrators like
Norman Rockwell,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
have symbolism that's
hidden and embedded

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:84%
in their artwork in a way that
I believe the artists weren't

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:90%
consciously aware of.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And I found now
over 100 examples

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of classic and
modern art embedding

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:90%
symbolism that belies--

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did it come from?

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Again, I would say
that the precognition as well

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.906 align:middle line:90%
as the--

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the "Back
to the Future" movie?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe that
when artists feel inspired,

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and they tap into that
source of intuition,

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
or they use symbolism
from dreams in order

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to create something,
very often, just

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.350 align:middle line:84%
like in scientific
breakthroughs,

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:84%
people can't always explain
where the idea comes from.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But then later,
it's found useful.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe that these artists
are getting an intuition

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
from a source that is
outside of our time and space

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and has a look at the future.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You produced a
clip and some examples

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:90%
of precognitive artwork.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: I'm going to
highlight some precognition

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:10%
in predictive art using what
I call the overlays method.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.375 align:middle line:10%
We'll begin with
Goya's 1826 painting,

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:10%
"Milkmaid of Bordeaux."

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:10%
I duplicate the image, mirror
it, and reduce the opacity,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:10%
and immediately, I see something
like a serpent or naga spirit.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:10%
As I slide this image
across its mirror,

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:10%
there is the DC Comics
character Swamp Thing 150 years

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:10%
before he was created.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.790 align:middle line:10%
And at the center of his
face is fully articulated

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Masonic iconography.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:10%
There's loads of
other creatures here.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:10%
This is just a sampling.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:10%
We see a bird something, like
a swallow or a heron there.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:10%
As I rotate the image and
layer it on top of itself,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:10%
I see a number of creatures.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:10%
Here's a winged bird man-type
creature with arms and legs,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:10%
a fully articulated face.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:10%
While I was creating
that Swamp Thing image,

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:10%
I'd noticed when I look
at it from a right angle,

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:10%
there's something like a beast
with a large mouth chomping

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:10%
down there.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:10%
It's worth pointing out
here that Swamp Thing

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:10%
seems to have amputated
arms and is leaking

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:10%
water out of his humerus bones.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:10%
So we're draining
the Swamp Thing.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.600 align:middle line:10%
There's layers of predictive
iconography and symbolism

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.400 align:middle line:10%
in there.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:10%
That's just a taste.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at the
infamous Christ on the Cross

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:10%
etching from Durer.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1505, he created
this iconic image.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:10%
I reduced the opacity
of a duplicate,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:10%
mirror it, slide
it across itself,

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:10%
and we see that
date is now 2021.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:10%
And there is a bit of a devil,
a demon, maybe an Antichrist.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:10%
The opposite of Christ
would be the Antichrist.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:10%
So we have an Antichrist as
well as a pagan pan, a rabbit.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.270 align:middle line:10%
And, well, Christ begins
to look a bit like a clown.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:10%
I'm thinking of
Joaquin Phoenix playing

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Christ and Mary Magdalene, and
then six months later, playing

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.180 align:middle line:10%
the Joker.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:10%
The 1505 looks like ISOS
possibly, and in the mirror,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:10%
of course, that's 2021.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:10%
So possibly, we're
looking at symbolism

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:10%
that's precognitive
that we're in the age

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:10%
or spirit of the Antichrist.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:10%
Christ said to spread the good
news and love one another,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:10%
and here we are more polarized
and hateful than ever

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.700 align:middle line:10%
at the moment.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.200 align:middle line:10%
There's also some
imagery that looks

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:10%
like Smokey the Bear as well as
some other cartoon characters,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:10%
and I'm reminded of the
forest fires and the wildfires

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:10%
across the West Coast in the US.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:10%
There's other etchings
of Christ by Durer

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:10%
that also have some teddy bear
and bear symbolism as well as

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:10%
some other Masonic iconography.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.630 align:middle line:10%
I found it interesting when we
invert Christ and then mirror

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:10%
this signature of Durer.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.260 align:middle line:10%
He uses his initials here.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:10%
We get a little billy
goat face there.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a
little bit of a tell.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:10%
If you see that, then you
know you're onto something.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:10%
So here we are in the age of the
Antichrist, polarized, hateful,

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.565 align:middle line:10%
and this seems to be a bit
of a co-created warning.

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Dramatic.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: We could
spend hours going

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:90%
through the imagery I found.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.240 align:middle line:84%
That was just a brief
sample, but there this--

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
this is far beyond
something like a Rorschach--

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When what
was that made?

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Now, that painting
was made in 1505, it stated.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And clearly,
there was a 2021 backward.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
You could see that up
there in the corner.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Yeah, I discovered
this phenomenon in 2017.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I would say actually
a better descriptor

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
would be I was shown in
a moment of inspiration,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:84%
so I don't take complete
credit for that.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that let's
say a higher self or form

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence that
was assisting Albrecht

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Durer and Francisco Goya.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.215 align:middle line:84%
I found this in
Michelangelo and da Vinci.

00:35:07.215 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them?

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: And even
Norman Rockwell.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It continues on into the
20th and 21st century.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I believe that--

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it scary?

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: The first time I saw
this phenomenon, I got chills,

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.075 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't scared.

00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:24.900 align:middle line:90%
I felt a calmness.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I would actually describe it
as a spiritual experience.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a message
there, Jason, somewhere.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.236 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: There is.

00:35:31.236 --> 00:35:37.060 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be warnings,
but there's also a reassuring--

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:10%
I find it reassuring that
we have an opportunity

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:10%
to co-create or participate
with this form of intelligence.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And if it's going out
of its way to warn us,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be benevolent.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
that's what it's doing?

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe that
there's this could be--

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
let's say Albrecht Durer
wasn't trying to warn us,

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:05.450 align:middle line:84%
but while he's tapping into
the icon of Christ and creating

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that artwork, this could
be a perfect opportunity

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:14.360 align:middle line:84%
for the co-creative faculty as
I refer to it to inspire Durer

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to create forms and illustrate
images that have this

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:90%
embedded--

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to Albrecht Durer
or any of the other artists

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I found.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that like I said,
it's a little bit of a tell.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like something is
pulling back the curtain.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems like something
is consciously

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to see
some of the predictive

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and, let's say, less
chaotic nature of our world.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it trying
to tell us or warn us?

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe that we
have an incredible co-creative

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:90%
power that is--

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm reminded
of the discovery

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics almost
a century ago showed us

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that the type of attention
that we pay to this world

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:90%
changes this world.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
world is, let's say,

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.080 align:middle line:84%
less chaotic and
material than we realize.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:10%
And that there's a
preferred order to things

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.890 align:middle line:10%
that we've moved away
from, and I believe

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:10%
that we're co-creating
a world that

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:10%
has less love, understanding,
and order to it at the moment.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
for us to get back

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to that more holistic,
co-creative existence

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that Owen Barfield
articulated and one

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.130 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about the
fossils of consciousness.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
predict the future?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I have speculated
about future events

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and been right based on looking
at predictive programming

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
after studying predictive
programming after the fact.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say,
there's symbolism for 9/11

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:90%
in a myriad of--

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before 9/11?

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: No.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know of anybody who--

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
after the fact?

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.295 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: It's
always after the fact.

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had some
social media outlets

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that unfortunately
got deplatformed

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.323 align:middle line:90%
for one thing or the other.

00:38:13.323 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I understand.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: But I made a name
for myself on social media

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.780 align:middle line:84%
for speculating
about some things.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I saw some Super Bowl outcomes
and Super Bowl scores embedded

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:90%
in Hollywood entertainments.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to
take you to Vegas.

00:38:30.445 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: I had imagine that--

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.570 align:middle line:84%
well, Vegas doesn't allow you
to predict the exact score

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of the Super Bowl.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
The odds would be so incredible
that if you got lucky enough

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.510 align:middle line:90%
to do it--

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd be huge.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.645 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: You'd
own the casino,

00:38:41.645 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:84%
so they can't afford
to risk those odds.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But I have pointed
towards symbolism emergent

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:53.530 align:middle line:84%
in the media that seemed to
point towards mass shootings.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 2017,
I produced some media

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that said that there was various
different things like the TV

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:06.470 align:middle line:84%
show "The Walking Dead" as
well as particular movies that

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:84%
were out at the time seemed
to have emergent patterns.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern I was
seeing was a mass shooting

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:90%
at a fairgrounds.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the area I lived
in at in Massachusetts,

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I avoided this large
fairground event

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that comes about every year
called The Big E because I

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.530 align:middle line:84%
was concerned
that, based on what

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:84%
predictive programming showed
me before, I told my friends,

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about a mass
shooting at a fairgrounds.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I posted some material
about that to YouTube

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:90%
in August of 2017.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, less
than two months later,

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.100 align:middle line:84%
there was a mass shooting
in Nevada at a fairgrounds.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:10%
I believe this is
where groups of people

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:10%
who are sharing any kind
of pattern recognition,

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:10%
premonitions, or precognition.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:10%
If you were to collate
a number of people

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:10%
who have a faculty
with this, you

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.703 align:middle line:10%
might be able to zero in on
events before they happen.

00:40:01.703 --> 00:40:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, how do
people track your work?

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I'm on YouTube
under my name, Jason Bickford.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Symbols, patterns, and gnosis.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I also have a web page,
GnosticonPress.com,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and I'm on Patreon.com/Bickford.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Makes you think, doesn't it?

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.623 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: It does.

00:40:20.623 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
that is interactive,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and far more
interesting than just a cold,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:90%
mechanical universe.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Thank you, George.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All kinds of symbolism
and things if you look for it,

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.450 align:middle line:10%
and if you look for it,
you may find something

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:10%
that you might not want to see.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
