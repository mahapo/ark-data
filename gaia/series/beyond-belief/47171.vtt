00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.932 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.766 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.894 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
to another edition of "Beyond

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.809 align:middle line:10%
Belief."

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest, physicist

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.307 align:middle line:10%
professor Ron Mallett, as
we talk about time travel.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
he's condensed it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.385 align:middle line:10%
into one of his works,
"Time Traveler."

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:10%
The subject has
fascinated me and you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.372 align:middle line:10%
since we were kids, Ron--

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:46.205 align:middle line:10%
>> RON MALLETT: Yes.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.705 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: --the possibilities
of traveling and coming back

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:10%
and going into the future.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple professors
at Michigan Technological

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
University, and they are
perusing the website looking

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.755 align:middle line:84%
for clues that they think future
time travelers may have dropped

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in to see if we're being visited
by future time travelers.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.392 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, it depends
on whether they're terrestrial

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.683 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:10%
And let me be clear about that.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Tell me
these differences.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.355 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: OK.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is that if
we created a device here

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth, it's
the device that's

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:10%
going to actually
be doing the effect.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in the
work that I've done,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to show
using a mathematical model

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that a circulating beam of light
will cause a twisting of space.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And if that twisting of
space is strong enough,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
it will cause time to
get twisted into a loop,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and along that loop
in time, you could

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.105 align:middle line:84%
go from the past to the
present to the future--

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And just
keeping going.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.105 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: --and
you could go-- right.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is that when
you turn the device on,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:10%
that's when the effect starts.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you turned it
on, for instance, today

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and left it on for 10 years,
someone could send information

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
or come back 7 years, 5 years,
all the way up to the point

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that the machine was
turned on, but they

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:90%
can't go earlier than that, OK?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So this actually answers
the question as far

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:90%
as a terrestrial time machine.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I tell my students that
if someone claims that they're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
a time traveler from the future
that you should be polite,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
number one, and then second, you
should say where's your device?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they cannot have
materialized into nothing.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They have to have materialized
into a device, OK?

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So since a human scale-- since
we don't see time travelers

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
from the future, that
just simply means

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.729 align:middle line:84%
that a human scale time machine
has not yet been invented.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Didn't make it.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.811 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:90%
But that's terrestrial, mind.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
When I mention
extraterrestrial, that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
gets into a whole
different realm.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Because since the
'90s, astrophysicist

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
have found what are known
as extrasolar planets.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.732 align:middle line:84%
These are actually planets
that are orbiting other suns.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All over the place.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: All over the place.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.696 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that's right.

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They found hundreds
of these things

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
right just in the
neighborhood of our galaxy.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: And there
are billions of galaxies.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.805 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: So the thing is
thatis what we realize is that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.527 align:middle line:84%
some of these planets
are actually too close

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:90%
to their suns.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.776 align:middle line:90%
They're too hot.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were too far away.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We were
lucky, weren't we?

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.293 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: We were lucky.

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
We were, you might say, part
of that class of planets which

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
they now have-- in fact, the
title of that class, which

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
physicists use, are
called Goldilocks

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
planets because
they're just right.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that we feel
that these civilizations are

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
out there, that probably the
universe is teeming with life.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Now some of it will be
more primitive than us,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but some of it might
be more advanced.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: In fact, they could
be there for millions of years.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, we're only
4 and 1/2 billion years old.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.079 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The universe
is almost 14 billion.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.953 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And let me
ask you something, Ron,

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
as we get into this.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
How long does it
take life to develop

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
on any kind of a planet that
might be in the Goldilock zone?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, if you
look at our own planet--

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact
numbers, but life is a very,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
very recent portion
of our epoch.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very, very
small portion of it.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's not just
simply the formation of life,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
but you have to talk about
technological development

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of the life, but not only
the technological development

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.752 align:middle line:84%
of the life but the type of
civilizations that developed.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I'm saying this,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
been studies on this.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And by technological
development,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean when they've
gotten to a point where

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
we are, where we have
nuclear weapons have

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
these planets blown themselves

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
up?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.141 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's possible.

00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's possible.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have to
take that into account.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
to take into account

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
those civilizations
that have gone insane,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.647 align:middle line:84%
essentially, and
destroyed themselves

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
or those civilizations
who have gotten

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:90%
beyond that, who have matured.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.552 align:middle line:90%
If they do.

00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: If they do.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But now if you're
talking about that,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
then you're getting smaller
and smaller and smaller

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
possibility, if they're
anything like us, OK?

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:90%
But they may not be.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it's conceivable,
if they're still alive,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.457 align:middle line:84%
they could be billions
of years ahead of us.

00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: They could be.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.595 align:middle line:84%
Well, they definitely could
be millions or thousands

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
of years ahead of us.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And that means that if they've
developed time travel--

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.605 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose that
a civilization

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
has developed time travel.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's say a million years.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.936 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: The thing is is
that their device would have

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:10%
the same limitation, but
they could have traveled back

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:10%
in time and may have visited us.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.225 align:middle line:10%
But this wouldn't
be from our future.

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:10%
This would have been
from their future.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And once we encounter
them, we might

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:10%
be able to use their time
machine to go back and visit

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.222 align:middle line:10%
ancient civilizations,
to visit the past.

00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a good idea.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
People who witness
extraterrestrials

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that they think are in craft
that seem to just disappear,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.154 align:middle line:84%
is it possible those
are time machines?

00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well,
see, here's the thing.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm a physicist, and
one of the things that's

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
important to realize
is verifiability, OK?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in talking
about time travel

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.344 align:middle line:84%
based on Einstein's
theories, the experiments,

00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
like the ones that have been
done at the Naval Observatory

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.176 align:middle line:84%
or the ones that
are done at CERN,

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
these are repeatable
experiments.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's why physicists
believe in them.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The thing with the
UFOs, now, yes, it

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
is a possibility that life out
there could have visited us,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.685 align:middle line:84%
but the universe is so
vast it's hard to know.

00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: So
without verifiability,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:84%
which means literally having
some sort of real hard evidence

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that can be examined by
the scientific community,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
then that's an open question,
and that's not something that

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
most of the community
would take seriously.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
divide because, yes,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the scientific
community believes

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that the universe probably
is teeming with life.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Whether that life has visited
us is an open question.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But again, could these be time
machines that we're seeing?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.022 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: In principle-- and
I see where you're going here--

00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.605 align:middle line:84%
in principle, yes,
it's a possibility.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because they
flash in and flash out.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.695 align:middle line:90%
But once again, verifiability.

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're a scientist.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want proof,
hard data and stuff like that.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.461 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: But yes, in
principle it could be possible.

00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want to go back
into time and see your father.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.001 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want to warn
him of his medical condition

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:90%
to help him.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
There's an old saying,
what is has been.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:90%
The past is the past.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't alter
things that have been.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
You can only go forward.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Realistically, is that
the same as time travel,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.225 align:middle line:84%
you can really only go forward,
what has happened has happened?

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: No.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.599 align:middle line:84%
According to Einstein's
general theory of relativity,

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
you can go into the past.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.135 align:middle line:84%
And there's more than just
simply my way of looking at it.

00:07:46.135 --> 00:07:48.426 align:middle line:84%
I should mention that I'm
not the only researcher who's

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
looking at using
Einstein's theories.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
There are people at, for
instance Kip Thorne and his

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
group or a related group, who've
looked at using the notion

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes as a possibility
for travelling back in time.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.094 align:middle line:84%
And there's a physicist at
Princeton, Richard Gott, who's

00:08:04.094 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
looked at the
notion of using what

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
are known as cosmic
strings to go back.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
people who are

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:90%
looking at this possibility.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So as far as
Einstein's theories,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:90%
we can go back to the past.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
The question is is
that-- it becomes two.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
One becomes a question
of morality and ethics.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Should we go back into the past?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Should we
go back and alter it?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And alter it.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The other question is
is that-- at least I

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
think that's important-- if
we go back into the past,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is it the past that
we think it would be?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason why I phrase it
that way is the fact that we've

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
relativity physics, OK?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
There's actually another
pillar of modern physics

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that's just as
important as relativity.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, for our
technological civilization,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.665 align:middle line:84%
it's actually even
more important.

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's quantum mechanics.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And everything, our PCs,
our laptop computers,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
all of these things are
based on quantum theory.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But quantum theory's a
very, very strange thing.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
In Newton's theory, you
can make exact predictions

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of what's going to happen
next if you have all

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
the information about
the present moment.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
In quantum mechanics,
not only can't you

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
get all the
necessary information

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
about the present
moment, but you can only

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
predict the
probability of what's

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
going to happen into the future.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And this has led to a
very, very odd notion that

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
sounds like science
fiction, but it's real.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
It's called parallel
universe theory.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:90%
The multiverses, right?

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.405 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is is that--

00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:37.609 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: --there was
a physicist at Princeton.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
His name was Hugh Everett III.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1957, he decided
to apply quantum mechanics

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:90%
to the universe as a whole.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
from his equations

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that it made
the following very strange

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
prediction, that
whatever can happen

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that has an alternative for
happening, both of these

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:90%
will play out.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.124 align:middle line:84%
To give you a specific example
that I like to use a lot,

00:10:02.124 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and that is suppose
at lunch today

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
decide to have a fish

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
sandwich or a cheeseburger.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
At the moment,
there's a George Noory

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that has chosen
the fish sandwich.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.414 align:middle line:84%
There's a George Noory that
has chosen the cheeseburger.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In the multiverse.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: In the other--
right-- separate universe, OK?

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that they
don't know about each other,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
but they are there,
and they're very real.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And this happens for
every single decision

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:90%
every single one of us makes.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
This is mind-boggling,
but it doesn't even

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.568 align:middle line:84%
have to do with humans,
I should mention.

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could there be
a third multiverse where

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a George Noory who
is getting on a plane to come

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to Denver to do "Beyond
Belief" in the past,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.774 align:middle line:84%
and he hasn't gotten here
yet, to interview Ron Mallett?

00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, the thing
is is that when you're talking

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:90%
about-- yes, there could be.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But those are part of all of
these parallel universes, OK?

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
is that that leads

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to an interesting
proposition, though,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
because what does
this mean for time?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was a physicist,
in fact, at Oxford--

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
his name was David
Deutsch-- and what

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
he did was he worked
out the mathematics.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
you apply this notion

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of parallel universes
to time travel?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
was the following,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that when you travel back in
time, you arrive in the past,

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
but there's a split
of the universe.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
You arrive in a
parallel universe,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and in that parallel universe
you can do whatever you want.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the original
universe you came from,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.124 align:middle line:90%
it isn't affected at all.

00:11:38.124 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I see.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: And this has
important implications

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.985 align:middle line:84%
for what's known as the
grandfather paradox.

00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.085 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: In the form
that I like to think of it,

00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:47.859 align:middle line:84%
it says that suppose you go
back into the past and you do

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
something like preventing your
grandparents from meeting each

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.442 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they don't
meet each other,

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't have your
parents, and if they

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
don't have your parents,
your parents don't have you.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't have you, how
did you go back into the past?

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How did you come back?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's called
the grandfather paradox.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you disappear,
like in "Back to the Future"--

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's the question.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --where Marty McFly
was disappearing on that

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:90%
photograph--

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.005 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --until he
changed some things?

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.113 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, in
fact, that's the thing.

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the parallel
universe theory comes in.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Because what it says is that
that won't happen, because when

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
you go back into
the past, you would

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.275 align:middle line:84%
arrive in the past of
a different universe.

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.264 align:middle line:84%
And in that past, you
could do something

00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
like preventing your
grandparents from meeting

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:84%
each other, you would
just find yourself

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
locked into a weird universe
in which you were never born.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You were
never born in that one.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: In that one.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But the other universe
that splits off

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is the one in which
you don't arrive in,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and so it gives
rise to the history

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
of what we're familiar with, OK?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So that might actually
be what happens to us.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, but
that's a real possibility

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
based on the solid physics
of quantum mechanics.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that as far
as going back into the past

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and changing things, that's
where this other question comes

00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this thing
of the butterfly effect,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that is to say that when you
do something in the past,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
it has more implications
than just what you did.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:10%
It can change and
have a ripple effect

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:10%
that can alter whole lives.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If we wanted to go
back and kill Hitler for some

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.489 align:middle line:84%
reason, it could have other
effects for the future, right?

00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that-- I
won't go into it because one

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
would want to do certain
things like that, perhaps.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.642 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: They'd just
do a lot of things.

00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: For good reasons.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.066 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: I want
old lottery numbers.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that, in
fact, this notion of correcting

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the past-- "The Outer Limits"
had a very great episode-- it's

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorites-- but
it brings up this thing,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
because it actually
had this FBI agent that

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
was had the possibility
of going back

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:90%
into the past to correct things.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it leads to a
very strange thing,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:84%
because the FBI agent would
only wait to find out,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if it
was a serial killer,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
the agent would only
wait to find out

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.884 align:middle line:84%
if the courts pronounced
this person guilty.

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: OK?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: So that they
felt they had now the moral--

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He wanted
the right person.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.355 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to make sure
they had the right person.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And then what they did was
to go back into the past

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
before that person had started
their serial killing career

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and take care of him.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And get it.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Get him
out or whatever.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:10%
So it blended this interesting
notion of morality and ethics

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:10%
in quite an intriguing matter.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.189 align:middle line:84%
But it will open up that
whole interesting thing.

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And what will show is that
when time travel does become

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
possible, it's going
to be regulated,

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
air travel regulated.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
time travel regulation.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We can't just jump
into our little device and go.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
something that's

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.753 align:middle line:10%
going to have to be regulated.

00:14:49.753 --> 00:14:50.586 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Organized.

00:14:50.586 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's good.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if everybody had
a time traveling device,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
everybody could
screw up the past.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
That would then screw up the
future simultaneously, right?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.605 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:05.146 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:05.146 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Everything would
be played around with.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me
about the wormholes.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.945 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered what the
heck is on the other side.

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Oh, yeah.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing
is is that that's

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
something we don't
really understand.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
A black hole is really
one mouth of a wormhole.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And just to remind you what a
black hole is, all stars work

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
by burning hydrogen, and
that means that what happens

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is the hydrogen atoms
collide and form helium,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.515 align:middle line:84%
and that gives off
energy that we have.

00:15:35.515 --> 00:15:36.639 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Right, we see it.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.831 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is eventually
that fuel will be used up,

00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:10%
and the star will
start to collapse.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:10%
When it does, the
gravity around the star

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.235 align:middle line:10%
will start to get so great
that the very light that tries

00:15:47.235 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:10%
to get away from the star--

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Can't.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: --gets pulled back.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if all the light
gets pulled back--

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: --then
what do you see?

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.256 align:middle line:90%
You see nothing.

00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what a black hole is.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the question
is is what happens

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.493 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of that?

00:15:57.493 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, if light can't get
out and you happen to go in,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
then you're in trouble
because you can't get out.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do you get torn apart?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.563 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well,
that's one scenario.

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Because what
happens is even here

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the Earth
because our feet are closer

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
Earth than our head,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.785 align:middle line:84%
gravity actually
pulls more strongly--

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Constantly.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: --on our feet.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:90%
But we never notice it.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:10%
But if you go into a
black hole, that effect

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:10%
becomes so exaggerated
that your feet

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:10%
start accelerating
towards the black hole

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.619 align:middle line:10%
faster than your head.

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And you pull them up.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: And you would be
shredded like spaghetti as you

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.079 align:middle line:90%
go in.

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:90%
That wouldn't be the end of it.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Your molecules would start
getting shredded, then

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:90%
your atoms.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.269 align:middle line:84%
You would end up as
an energy soup going

00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
towards the center
of the black hole.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Instantly, probably.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
The thing is, however--

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
theoretical, though.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.881 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's theoretical.

00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, however, some
people have conjectured

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that two other
possibilities may exist.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
One is that once you go into the
black hole that it's actually

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.327 align:middle line:84%
connected by a tunnel to another
black hole so that you go

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
in-- And in fact,
you could think of--

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.201 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: For another universe?

00:16:57.201 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, that's it.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.665 align:middle line:90%
Exactly

00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.123 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I did do
well in physics.

00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
There are two possibilities.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The other mouth could
be in our universe,

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.434 align:middle line:84%
or the other mouth could
be in another universe.

00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In another universe.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is is when you go in,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
assuming that the black
hole is large enough

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and that you don't
get shredded, then

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
you could actually end
up in another universe.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some people
think that our Big Bang might

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
actually be the result of
this kind of a process,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.572 align:middle line:84%
that what's happening is that
the other universe-- in fact,

00:17:33.572 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
there was a theory that's
been developed by a--

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Gets
sucked into there?

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.704 align:middle line:90%
Gets sucked in there.

00:17:37.704 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the Big Bang
is actually the result

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.809 align:middle line:90%
of another universe--

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Being spit out.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.102 align:middle line:84%
And that we're the child
universe of another universe.

00:17:46.102 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this has
been developed as

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:90%
a serious mathematical theory.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.932 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many dark holes
are there in our universe?

00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, we
don't know how many.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
all over the place?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: They're
all over the place.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do we
know they're there?

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.553 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well,
that's a good point.

00:17:58.553 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you can't see it,
how do you know it's there?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well,
nature's been kind to us.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the way we found
the first black hole, which

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
is called Cygnus X-1, which is
about 10,000 lightyears away

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
from us, is the fact that there
are many star systems in which

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:90%
two stars orbit each other.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.926 align:middle line:84%
It would be weird-- these are
called binary star systems.

00:18:16.926 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And that
happens a lot.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.591 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: That happens a lot.

00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:10%
Our system has only one sun,
but it would be strange,

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:10%
because if we were part
of a binary star system,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:10%
we would actually see
two suns up in the sky.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But the way they detected
the first black hole

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
was that there was a star which
was called a blue giant star,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and it literally has a blue
cast to it, and it's gigantic.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.105 align:middle line:10%
If you plopped it into the
center of our solar system,

00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:10%
it would swallow up
the inner planets.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.258 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's
nearing its end.

00:18:40.258 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, it's actually
not-- It's nearing its end,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%
but for a different reason.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is it's being

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
orbited by an
invisible companion.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we
can see the companion

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is the gases are being pulled
off of the blue giant star

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.925 align:middle line:90%
into this invisible companion.

00:18:57.925 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: And as the gases
are being funneled into it,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.664 align:middle line:84%
the gases heat up, and
they create a halo.

00:19:04.664 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
You've seen these beautiful
artists' conceptions sometimes

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.707 align:middle line:84%
where they actually show this
black center, and they show--

00:19:09.707 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: With a halo around it.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: --this halo around.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.115 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
a cloud or something.

00:19:13.115 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: That halo is
actually what's called

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
an accretion disc, and it's
due to gases that are actually

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
coming from the outside.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, the gases

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
are coming from the
blue giant star,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and they're being funneled in.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.725 align:middle line:84%
As they're being funneled
in, the black hole

00:19:26.725 --> 00:19:28.391 align:middle line:84%
is getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually what will happen
is that the black hole

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
will swallow up the
blue giant star.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But the way we were able
to see the black hole

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
was because we were able
to see the blue giant star,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
but the blue giant
star was wobbling.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they
looked at the x-rays

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
coming off of the
invisible companion,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see the x-rays,
except for at the very center

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.532 align:middle line:90%
nothing is coming out.

00:19:49.532 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it
like a vacuum, Ron,

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:84%
where it's just sucking in
anything that floats by?

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, the thing is
is that if it gets close enough

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.756 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: If our galaxy-- and
they do say there are dark

00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:10%
holes in our own galaxy,
in the middle of it.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: In the
middle of our galaxy,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:10%
they feel that there is actually
a super massive black hole.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: What is keeping
everything from going into it?

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, if you were
far enough away from it--

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in other words, if there was
a black hole in this room,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
for example, and you
were outside of it--

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
you would actually have to
get close enough to it--

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: To get pulled in.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.361 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: --to get pulled in.

00:20:22.361 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:10%
It would not just
happen automatically.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: You would actually
have to get close enough to it.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: So it doesn't have
a vacuum cleaner effect.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: It doesn't.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:10%
No, it doesn't.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:28.821 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:20:28.821 --> 00:20:31.104 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: It's just that
once you get too close,

00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:10%
then all of a sudden--

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Then it will.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Yeah.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's why the
name of it as being a hole

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
is a good name.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.599 align:middle line:84%
Although when they have
the conception, sometimes

00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
people will think
of it as being just

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:90%
like a two-dimensional thing.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It actually would be
more like a black sphere.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.813 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:20:43.813 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a solar system
just seemed to be revolving

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and got close to this.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Would the pulling in of it
be immediate or gradual?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: It would be gradual,
until you got right near

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:90%
the star.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is why
we see black holes,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
because of the fact that these
accretion discs are there.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty stable,
until you get into it.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.815 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into
it, then that's it.

00:21:08.815 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So all that matter
that would have gotten sucked

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
into this dark hole,
does it just dissipate?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
What happens to it?

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: That's
one of the puzzles.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.486 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
one of the puzzles

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been answered.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what's going on.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
As I said, there
was this conjecture

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.194 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes being
connected with it

00:21:26.194 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that could lead
to other universes

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
or to other parts
of other universes.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: --send a craft into
one, just to see what happens.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: Well, I
think one would do that,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.145 align:middle line:10%
but you would want
to do it with robots.

00:21:36.145 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not people.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Not people.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not people.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: The problem is is
that if it actually is just

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
a black hole then you won't
get any information out,

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:90%
because they can't transmit it.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they cross what's
known as an event horizon,

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
then the signal's cut
off, and you would not

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:90%
be able to know what's going--

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have no
idea what's going on.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.755 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:21:54.755 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.769 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't know
whether they ended up

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
into another
universe or ended up

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:90%
at some other portion of space.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
What we might try to do is
create a small wormhole,

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
if we could figure
out how to do that,

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:90%
just to experiment with that.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.516 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like
something CERN could do?

00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Not necessarily.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
However, it's interesting
that when they were setting up

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
CERN for a very long time
people were concerned

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that, when they
turned the machine on,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.664 align:middle line:90%
you would get small black holes.

00:22:26.664 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We did that.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:90%
On Coast to Coast--

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: That's right.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --we talked about it--

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --that it would
suck in the whole planet.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.823 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:22:31.823 --> 00:22:35.422 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
more PR to get people--

00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was great radio.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.936 align:middle line:84%
To keep people interested
in what was happening there.

00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it
never happened.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:10%
The machine functions perfectly
well without these things

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:10%
being created.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that we
can just-- it's not clear

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.185 align:middle line:84%
how we could just simply do
it, simply in a trustable way.

00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's
an individual--

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
heard the name John Titor.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Oh, yes.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
know about John,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
the 2034 time traveler
who apparently came back,

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
talked about a lot of things
that strangely are happening

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
now, civil unrest all around
the place and things like that?

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
When you, as a physicist,
an expert in time travel,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:84%
see stories like
that, do you say,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
well, this was pretty
well-conceived,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:90%
this is possible?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:10%
Or do you say, what a hoax?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: Well, actually--

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.905 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Or are you John Titor?

00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: No.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:10%
I say this is a
bunch of nonsense,

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:10%
to use a polite word on TV.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:40.795 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:10%
A little fooey, as we call it.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:10%
>> MALLETT: Right.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:10%
But no, the thing
is is that that

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:10%
falls in the category of
what I was saying earlier,

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:10%
that if you encounter this
person who claims they are,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:10%
be polite to them, OK?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.045 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just in case, right?

00:23:54.045 --> 00:23:56.926 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: No, just in
case that they're crazy.

00:23:56.926 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know what
their response is going to be

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
if you're not-- that's
what I mean by be polite--

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:01.997 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: --is that you really
don't know how this person is

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:84%
going to react if
you're skeptical.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:90%
But as I said, the thing is--

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They could go crazy.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.244 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right, exactly.

00:24:09.244 --> 00:24:12.094 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing--
and to me, in science,

00:24:12.094 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
important for the public

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to realize that, if a
claim is made in science,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:90%
it needs to be verified.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
If I've made this
claim about being

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:90%
able to mathematically show--

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You've got to show it.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: If anyone wants,
they can go to the "Technical

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Journal."

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.654 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have the
"Technical Journal"

00:24:28.654 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
articles, which are
refereed, posted on my site.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.566 align:middle line:84%
So not only are these
popular discussions

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that we have are out
there, but if they

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.812 align:middle line:84%
want to see the nuts and bolts
behind my work, it's out there.

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And the type of work that
I'm doing as far as showing

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
circulating light, when
that experiment's done,

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
it'll be verifiable.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It'll be repeatable.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
This person needs to
show their machine.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you cannot
materialize into something.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So whoever it is that claims
they're-- they actually have

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Show it to me.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.553 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Show it to me.

00:24:58.553 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's the real test.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:84%
If this person claims
that, say, OK, show me.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was at an
event years ago, Ron,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and some guy came up to me,
really clandestined, and said,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.291 align:middle line:84%
I've invented perpetual
motion, a machine.

00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you're kidding me.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've got
pictures of the machine.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Can I show it to you?

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.129 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've
got to be confidential,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and I said, no problem.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And he reaches into his
pocket, and I'm going, oh god,

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:90%
what's he got in there?

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
He pulls out some
Polaroid pictures

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.115 align:middle line:84%
of a machine made with
toilet bowl parts.

00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this and saying,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
this is your perpetual
motion machine?

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, I've
got it at home.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but it's made
with toilet bowl parts,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:90%
and he said, yeah, I know.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, does it work?

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, no, not yet.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I haven't perfected it yet.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I bet we could come across
a lot of those people who

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.453 align:middle line:84%
claim to have time
traveling devices, right?

00:26:03.453 --> 00:26:04.286 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And haven't perfected it yet.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.578 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a neat story--

00:26:07.578 --> 00:26:08.744 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Toilet bowl parts.

00:26:08.744 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: --by the way.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:90%
But that is the thing.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
If a claim is
made-- and this has

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to do not just with the
stuff that I'm doing,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but even the reason why
scientists now seriously

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:84%
believe in the possibility
extraterrestrial life

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they've
seen extrasolar planets.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: It's actually
something that's demonstrable.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And the soup's
the same, I think.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Right, exactly.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's out there.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.511 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: And it doesn't
matter whether we're talking

00:26:33.511 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
about this or the domain of
medicine or even the financial

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:90%
claims people make.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a mint
for you if you do this.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you be surprised
if the laws of physics changed

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe?

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Because I think it's the same--

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: No.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --wherever you go.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.676 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLETT: Yeah.

00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is
that it would lead

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
to an inconsistency
between different parts

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that's almost
like having hot water

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:90%
next to cold water.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:10%
In other words, some
sort of an equilibrium

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:10%
would have to occur.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is that when we
look out into the universe,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:10%
we're able to make predictions
about the stars out there.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We actually see the elements in
these stars that we see here.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:10%
In other words, we're
able to make predictions

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:10%
about what's happening out in
other parts of the universe.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:10%
If the laws of physics were
different in the other parts

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, then the
predictions that we make

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:10%
and the behavior that
we will expect to see

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:10%
would be something
that wouldn't be.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You couldn't do it.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Exactly.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You couldn't do it.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Ron, for people who want
to get a hold of you

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
or to monitor what you
do, where do they go?

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Well, they can go to
my physics department website.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:50.195 align:middle line:84%
It's www.physics.uconn--
and that's U-C-O-N-N-- .edu.

00:27:50.195 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I should mention
that the book

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.464 align:middle line:84%
is available from
amazon.com as well.

00:27:57.464 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's a great
read, by the way.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.046 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Thank you.

00:28:00.046 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You enlighten us, and it's
always fun talking to you.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MALLETT: Oh,
thank you very much.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Dr. Ron Mallett.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MALLETT: Thank you.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.966 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thank you so much.

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:10%
Time travel.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:10%
It's not possible today, but
it could be possible tomorrow.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And if it does,
where would you go?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:10%
Would you go into the
future or back in time?

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Norry, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:90%
