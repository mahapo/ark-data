>>Many people today don't
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.165 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to uncover what really happened.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.336 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.322 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>We need to give
people the information.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, the host of the
nationally-syndicated Coast

to Coast AM and Gaiam TV
bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: At one time
in our lives, all of us

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
will know someone
who has cancer.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We might even have
cancer ourselves.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
On Beyond Belief, we're going
to explore this dreaded disease

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and find out why it happens
and how we can possibly

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
help people fight it.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on Beyond Belief is
a well-known author, clinician,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and an expert in
cancer research.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome Dr.
Leonard Coldwell.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.022 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:11.896 align:middle line:90%
Leonard, how are you?

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:12.768 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. LEONARD COLDWELL:
Good to see you.

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:13.204 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to see you, too.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:14.245 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Thank you.

00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:14.995 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
I've talked to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed a lot
of people in my life

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
about cancer and cancer research
and cutting-edge technology

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:90%
as it has to do with cancer.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.706 align:middle line:84%
No one is better than
doctor Leonard Coldwell.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:90%
It's good to have you here.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Thank you so much.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:31.711 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.014 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you begin to
first start studying cancer?

00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It's very
important, George,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that your viewers understand
where I'm coming from,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that they understand
my reputation.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 years
old, my mom was

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with hepatitis C,
liver cirrhosis, and liver

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
cancer in a terminal state
with six months to live.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
All seven siblings
of my mom had cancer.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother, my grandfather
died of cancer on both sides.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
My father died of cancer and
my stepfather died of cancer.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.246 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, God.

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: I have more
knowledgeable about cancer

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and the impact of cancer on
the loved ones and the cancer

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
patients than any other
living human being on Earth.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Let me start with
a good note first.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.595 align:middle line:84%
My mom, 42 years later, is still
alive today and 100% healthy.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:16.594 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Thank you, George.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
got me into all of this.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to turn this
into a religious issue,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
but I made a deal with God
when I was 12 years old.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And said, God, if you
help me to cure my mom,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll spend the rest of my
life helping other mothers

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.699 align:middle line:84%
or parents and
their children not

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
have to go through what my
mom and I had to go through.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing wrong with
making a deal with God.

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: OK.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing wrong at all.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: OK.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
cancer, Leonard,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'm convinced we all
have cancer cells in our system

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
right now it's just
our immune system

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.149 align:middle line:84%
is strong enough either to beat
it or not, but what is cancer?

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely, George.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:90%
We are all born with cancer.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is nothing else a
mutated atrophied cells,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
half dead cells, the wrong
cells are multiplying instead

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:90%
of the healthy cells.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And this happens actually
from the very first moment

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:90%
when we are born.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:90%
We are all born with cancer.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is born without cancer.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:90%
We all have these mutated cells.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
We all have these atrophied
cells, these half dead cells

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that just needs to get renewed.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
When our immune
system is normal,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
meaning our energy
level is normal,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
our immune system just takes
care of this on a daily basis.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.024 align:middle line:84%
Like if you cut yourself, the
immune system takes care of it.

00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to think
about it all day long,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
please heal, please
heal, please heal.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So when we lack in energy,
George, and this is basically

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
where my entire
research came from,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that all illness is
based on lack of energy,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and the main clause
for lack of energy

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:90%
is mental and emotional stress.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Living in constant worries,
living in constant fears, fears

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.137 align:middle line:84%
about the economy, not
having a job in the future--

00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: All
these kind of fears.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are all
natural fears, by the way,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.768 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But they need to be in
proportion and not chronic.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
See, lack of self
love can cause a lot

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of stress, lack of
self-acceptance,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:90%
making a compromise.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The main cause of cancer, ladies
and gentlemen, in my opinion,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is a compromise
against yourself.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.023 align:middle line:84%
You hang into a
relationship that you

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
know is going to kill you
just because of the children,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might be,
what the neighbors will say,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
what the relatives
will say, this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like where the
main problem is coming from.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Or you go
to a job that kills you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
in the whole meaning of the
word, and you keep on going,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:90%
keep on going.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hate
going in every day.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.091 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: That's why most
deadly heart attacks happen

00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Monday morning between 8
and 9 o'clock when people

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
get ready for a work week that
they'd rather literally die

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.574 align:middle line:84%
before they go one more
time to that job, George.

00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's their body, it's
the way of saying good-bye.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Shutting down.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really like self-sabotage,
and cancer very often

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:90%
can be a self-sabotage response.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your question,
if your body is oxygen rich--

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Otto Warburg and Max Planck,
both got a Nobel Prize

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in medicine by proving cancer
cannot exist in an alkaline,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:90%
oxygen-rich environment.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely impossible.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Since 1911, 1933, we know this.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If we would have just followed
that knowledge where people got

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
even awarded for getting this
knowledge out and proving

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
it scientifically, we
would have no cancer.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Every cancer in my experience
is curable in 2 to 16 weeks

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
guaranteed if you
are still responsive

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.715 align:middle line:84%
physically and mentally and you
don't have medical treatment

00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
up front.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
because that time period

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.112 align:middle line:84%
the cells regenerate
during that time period?

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
With my mom who had liver
cancer in a terminal

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
state plus hepatitis
c and liver cirrhosis,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
so the liver was completely
inflamed on top of it.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But the liver renews every
six weeks after I figured out

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
1 to 7 billion liver cells
renew each second, 1 to 7

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
billion liver cells
each second, we

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.565 align:middle line:84%
have every six weeks
a brand new liver.

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
After I found this out, I
ask myself, why in the world

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.821 align:middle line:84%
does my mom need to keep her
rotten, rotting-down, dying

00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
liver?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't need to.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
a six-weeks period,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.369 align:middle line:90%
lungs, kidneys.

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Lungs need a little
bit longer, but kidneys

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
eight weeks, lungs
up to eight months.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But our skin, the soft tissue in
our skin renews every 72 hours.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Our skin renews
every four weeks.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.406 align:middle line:84%
So the basic body model
that you have today

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
is not the same
that you're going

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:90%
to have the one from tomorrow.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is when we have these
opportunity in front of us,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
when we understand we are
building and rebuilding

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
all the time, every
single second.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Bite yourself into your cheek.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:90%
How fast does it heal?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So only if the energy
level is down enough

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
to prevent your immune system
for doing what it's supposed

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to do, then cancer
or just any form

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of malfunction in the
system can occur or grow.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Your cancerous cells cannot
multiply or excel in any way,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form if there
is oxygen in the system,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
if you are alkalized, if your
body is on a pH scale of 7.36.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
slightly alkaline.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.935 align:middle line:90%
7 is neutral.

00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's critical
to do that at this time.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: That is
very, very critical

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:90%
because you need to be alkaline.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
That means also virus and
bacteria cannot strive or exist

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
in a non-acidic environment.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So when your body
is acidic, that's

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:90%
when ever negativity strives.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Stress is the number one
cause, the number one

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
cause for acidity.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand
that modern research shows

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that 86% of all illness,
of all doctor visits, 86%

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:90%
is stress related.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The Stanford University
even concocted a study

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.834 align:middle line:90%
and came out with a 95% number.

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:45.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:45.905 align:middle line:90%
That's enormous.

00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:47.071 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: That's enormous.

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It leaves only-- if
you go with my number,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
86% of all illness and doctor
visits are stress related.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
If you just go with this number,
it only leaves 14% for diet,

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
for toxemia from
the outside sources.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And people need to
understand how important it

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is that you love yourself,
respect yourself,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.565 align:middle line:84%
that you know you are
somebody and there

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is nothing that can stop you
if you don't stop yourself

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
because most people even in the
healing process, George, are

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
their main road block in
their life towards health.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can cure
him or herself.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I cannot cure you.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We have spoken about
it often enough,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:90%
but I can be your coach.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I can show you and teach
you how to cure yourself

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
in 2 to 16 weeks, no matter
what you really have,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
and this is what even
HIV viruses can easily

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
destroyed with
hydrogen peroxide,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:90%
with oxygen, basically.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And we need to just wake up.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to more
information on the natural way.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We cannot rely on the
medical profession.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
56% of all people in
our world have cancer

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
or will get cancer,
every second person.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
huge, and let me tell you,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
some time ago, I was at the
City of Hope in Los Angeles,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and they are doing
cutting-edge cancer research.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a
researcher, and I

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
said, what are you doing
right now to fight cancer?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we're
trying to isolate cells,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to attack
them without killing

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:90%
the normal cells around it.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her about
chemotherapy, and I said,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%
what are your views on that?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, right
now, that and radiation

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
seem to be our only
ways of battling cancer,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
but-- and this is what
she said to me, Leonard.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, chemotherapy
is poison.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it
kills the good cells.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
It tries to kill the bad cells.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I wish
I had an alternative.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned you,
and I said, well,

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
what about an alkaline body
as opposed to an acidic body?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
What about all
these other things

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.062 align:middle line:84%
you can do, taking turmeric, for
example, and things like that?

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she said, I'm
going to look into that.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And these are well-bred,
well-knowledged,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.025 align:middle line:90%
hardworking people--

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:07.941 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Of course.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --dedicated to trying
to find a cure for cancer,

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
understand that there

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
are alternative things
out there to help people.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: First of all,
cancer is a holistic illness.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
It basically, it is
a thorn in your soul.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It is not compartmentalized.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
If I take your tumor out, you
will get a new tumor next week

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
because that was just a symptom.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The tumor is just a
symptom of the cancer.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It is not the cancer itself.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:90%
The cancer is in your soul.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The cancer is completely
somewhere else.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.409 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it can be from all
the poisons in the food--

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL:
--preservatives and so on.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course all of this,
in the air and whatever,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
the chemtrails that's out there.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But at the basics of
a terminal illness,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
as a basic of a chronic
disease, like cancer, there

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:84%
is something in
you that does not

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:90%
want to let you live anymore.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You do not literally want to
live in the environment you

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
exist in, and
chemotherapy, George,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
is based on mustard gas.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Mustard gas was invented in
the First and Second World War

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to kill soldiers
on the battlefield,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.437 align:middle line:84%
and it is forbidden in
the Geneva Convention--

00:11:16.437 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're putting
it into people with cancer?

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: They're
putting it in.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
The last 20 years as
far as I know nobody

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:90%
died of cancer anymore.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They all died of
the side effects

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of the medical treatment.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Chemotherapy kills
and causes cancer.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Radiation kills
and causes cancer.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
How can you think you put
Agent Orange into your backyard

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.627 align:middle line:84%
with flowers and grass
and bushes and trees

00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and there are a couple of weeds.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, you put Agent Orange on
there, you kill it all off

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
and you think, oh, wow.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Only the flowers will come back,
only the trees will come back,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and the nice bushes,
but the weeds will not?

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
What an absurd kind
of thinking is that?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand
this, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that it is our decision to
see ourselves as a unit,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:90%
we are one unit.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It is our soul, it's our
emotions, our mind, our spirit.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're constantly worried,
how can you be healthy?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
See you cannot even get the flu
or a cold if you are upbeat,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and positive, and powerful.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You will never,
ever see somebody

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.346 align:middle line:84%
get the flu or cold that
is upbeat and positive.

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
I have not had

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:90%
the flu since I can remember.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.644 align:middle line:84%
And I don't get vaccines
as you well know.

00:12:27.644 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Of course.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't tell people
to get them or not to get them.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:90%
That's up to them, but I don't.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I try to live the lifestyle
that you have presented to us,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to
be working for me.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: And it works
for everybody, George.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Just try it.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
If you just try a regular
breathing program,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
if you learn how
to breathe right,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.069 align:middle line:84%
you feel better like
this in seconds.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you think, wow,
that might be something.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.137 align:middle line:90%
The guy might be on something.

00:12:54.137 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people
really need to understand,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:84%
George, that just start a little
bit, just learn a little bit,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:90%
try a little bit.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Try a couple of herbs.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Try a couple of teas.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Go on a raw food diet.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Do a fasting for
two, three days,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and you feel instantly results.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And change
your attitude.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions from
you for Dr. Leonard Coldwell.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure we've got many.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.045 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.802 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I switched over to
a no sugar, no wheat, no flour

00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
diet a while ago and
had amazing results,

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
lost 20 pounds like
instantly, and my main concern

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
is skin cancer.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It's in my family.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard, I've read
some things about hemp oil

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:90%
being beneficial to that.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
thoughts on that?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: OK.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.109 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:32.864 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, skin cancer
is the easiest thing

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:90%
to cure in my opinion.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Just go into the sun and the
sun will cure it, number one.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It just will fall off.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
The hemp oil, if you put it on
usually for two, three days,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.624 align:middle line:90%
the mark falls off also.

00:13:47.624 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Hemp oil is a really, really
good element for skin cancer.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Skin cancer is the
easiest thing to cure,

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
just deficiency of certain
kind of ultraviolet light,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:90%
of sunlight, actually.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a lot of
sunlight on your skin cancer,

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:90%
just try it.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I cannot tell you
what to do, but I would do it.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would
do and everybody else

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I ever had with skin
cancer of my patients,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I sent them in the sun, and
hemp oil really, really works

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:90%
really, really well.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Hemp actually cures cancer in
general internally, externally.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:90%
It's really a great element.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like B17, laetrile.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I would really get
some apricot seeds.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you open up an
apricot, you have the kernel

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.566 align:middle line:84%
and you open it up, there is an
almond looking-like seed in it?

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:28.481 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The laetrile.

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: It's laetrile.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It's vitamin B17, and I
would eat 7 to 21 a day.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to up it
slowly, and I would

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
know I'm absolutely
fine in about 28 days.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Leonard, if you,
God forbid, had cancer,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
would you use traditional
medicine, radiation,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
chemo with it, or would
you go just natural?

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I know the late Steve
Jobs from Apple wrestled

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
with that about his prostate
cancer, and in his situation,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
he went all natural for a while
and then he decided not to,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
but it was too late.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: First of all, I
would never use any chemical.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I would never use surgery.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Surgery spreads the cancer
through your entire system.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
is already down.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get anesthesia,
you get all the medication

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and the pain medication.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:90%
They slice you open.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The body has to
close all of this.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why it
spreads like crazy.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden after
surgery, all these people

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
have a fast-growing
cancer, very aggressive.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.764 align:middle line:84%
The person didn't
have it before.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They gave it to him,
and that's the point.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would never,
ever even consider

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.457 align:middle line:90%
to even go to a doctor.

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
That is completely absurd.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And the issue with
Steven Jobs is,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
they are using it to
bad mouth natural means.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
He already had
medical treatment long

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
before he even came
up with the idea

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:90%
of trying something natural.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By then
it was too late?

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Not
necessarily too late,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
but if you mix
natural with medical,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you will always die, in
my experience, always.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.791 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It will
never, ever work.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
One negates the other.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do a
little bit of this.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so scared.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:90%
I try it all.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.112 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're praying
to Buddha, and to whatever.

00:16:06.112 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
You need to pray to all Gods.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.778 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
can understand how

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
people are confused
in what they do,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're
getting bombarded

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
from the government telling
them, don't do this,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:90%
don't do that.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy decision.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Dr. Coldwell.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was wondering.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I understand sugar is used
to find tumors in the body.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
How important is it with the
foods that we're eating today

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to do some other method,
or is it just that we want

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.288 align:middle line:84%
to be able to believe in
our own ability to heal?

00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are what
you eat, Leonard.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: The whole
meaning of the word.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The most important part
is if we understand

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
our new cells has to be
built from something.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
If this something is
bad building material,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
it's like you would build
a house with bad concrete,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't expect it to
last for a thousand years.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So our cells, and if
you think about it,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
every cell in our system
is renewed in 21 months.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, every single one.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:84%
These cells have to be
built from something.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Sugar, first of all, if it's
all natural, just fruit sugar,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter at all.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:90%
That is just a huge hoax.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame is actually the
feces of E. coli bacteria,

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
so if you use artificial
sweetness, you will get cancer.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Just believe me.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.876 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:17:26.876 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It's only a matter of time.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It might take a little
bit longer with you,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and if you drink a lot of
water, it takes longer.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have a gallon
of water a day

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
with half a teaspoon
of pink salt in it,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
you will live much, much
longer than anybody else

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
doing the exact same
thing that you are doing.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But we are what we eat,
and I would stay away

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
from refined sugar
in all circumstances.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a product
out there that you

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.027 align:middle line:84%
can get in major stores
called Just Like Sugar,

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's made from chicory root.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all organic,
and orange peel.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
That has zero calories.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.261 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It gives you that
sweetness without the sugar.

00:17:57.261 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Without the sugar.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And also people say
when you have cancer,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't have syrup, maple
syrup, organic maple syrup,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:90%
organic honey.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, that's completely
absurd, because you need,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
every deficiency
furthers the malgrowth,

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:90%
the malfunction of the system.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
enough, let's say

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
you have all vitamins, all
minerals that you need,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and trace minerals
that you need,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
there is physically no way
for the body to fall apart.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might get
depression and anxiety

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
because you're mentally not
there where your body is,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.918 align:middle line:84%
but we are actually in the
whole meaning of the word.

00:18:33.918 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm always
suggesting juicing.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The most important investment,
in my opinion, is a juicer.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Buy a juicer for $49
and just start juicing.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get better, better
nutrition than juicing.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
But of course, you need
a lot of volvic minerals

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:90%
coming from volcanic ash.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Basically, everything
else is depleted,

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's not in
the food anymore.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
If it's not in the soil, the
plant cannot create minerals.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So the plant can only suck
out of through the root system

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.102 align:middle line:84%
what's in the
ground in minerals,

00:19:06.102 --> 00:19:07.185 align:middle line:90%
so that's in the minerals.

00:19:07.185 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in
most plants any longer

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:90%
in most of our foods.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
George, if you look at
statistics from 100 years ago,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
everything was in there because
everything was in the soil.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.638 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's all
processed now, Leonard.

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to come back in
just a moment on Beyond Belief.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.756 align:middle line:84%
More with Dr. Leonard Coldwell
as we talk about cancer.

00:19:25.756 --> 00:19:31.102 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.102 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
to Beyond Belief

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Leonard Coldwell.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Leonard, I interviewed a
doctor from Italy, Dr. Tullio

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Simoncini, who attacks
cancer with soda bicarbonate.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
He literally injects it
right into the tumor.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.405 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
a technique like that?

00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:51.827 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It's absolutely
phenomenal, and it works.

00:19:51.827 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:84%
His book Cancer is a Fungus
is something everybody

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
should really read,
and I have seen

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
the videos of the
open organs getting

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
flushed by baking soda,
sodium bicarbonate.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But please remember if
you use baking soda,

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:90%
it needs to be food grade.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
You cannot use the regular stuff
because it has aluminum in it.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:90%
But I have seen the organs.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:84%
See, the white thing
that we see always

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
connected to cancer tissue
is actually a fungus,

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and a fungus can only
exist in an absolutely

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
acidic environment,
toxic, acidic environment.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It thrives on that.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It
thrives on it, and it

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
is believed that it keeps
the cancerous cells together.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Because on the videos that
he makes from his surgeries

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
where he flushes the organs
with sodium bicarbonate,

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
with a solution, it
disappears instantly.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So the white
disappears on contact,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you see the
tumor goes shrinking.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It is just such a phenomenal--

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.706 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: But he has also
an unbelievable technique

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to get the Trojan horse
into the cancer cell.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
If a cancer cell gets
alkaline from the inside out,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:90%
it dies instantly.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So he came up with the idea
to use syrup, maple syrup,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
organic, of course,
and he combines it

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.434 align:middle line:90%
with the baking soda.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To kind of
trick the cancer?

00:21:10.975 --> 00:21:12.308 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: To trick the cancer.

00:21:12.308 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It gets caramelized so
that it's in the caramel.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
You warm it up a little
bit, and you eat it.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, cancer
lives off sugar-- everybody

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
knows that-- and it
sucks up the syrup

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle line:84%
and there comes
the Trojan horse.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boom.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: The baking soda,
boom, there goes the cancer.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: And on contact.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this is
a simple procedure.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: And cheap.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Soda bicarbonate,
exactly, is very inexpensive.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't the mainstream
medical folks doing this?

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it because big pharma
doesn't want to do this?

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.391 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: The cancer industry
is a $60 billion-a-year

00:21:44.391 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
industry, prevention
and early diagnostic,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:90%
$230 billion-a-year industry.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we still
have no cure from them?

00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: We had, in
1900, a 7% cancer rate.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have a
56% cancer rate.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are running for
the cure, and we're

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
having all these pink ribbons,
and we're wasting our money

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and making all these
people rich that live off

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of
cancer patients.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
than a medical cure

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:90%
because they don't care.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The American Cancer Society
has in their statute,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
they have to dissolve the
moment a cure for cancer

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
has been found.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
There are 400 known natural
cancer cures out there,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and they cure cancer nearly
to 100% in all the cases.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, 400
known natural cancer cures,

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and you get intravenous
vitamin C 100 cc two,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:90%
three times a day, 12 days.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the cancer tumors
are gone in 12 days.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Royal Rife cured the cancer
like this with his rife machine.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
So he is--

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But look
what they did to him.

00:22:44.635 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: And to
Gerson and everybody

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:90%
else who cured cancer.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
The second you cure cancer,
they come after you,

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
they destroy you, or
with a perfect heart,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
you get a heart attack or
you drown in a 20-inch duck

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:90%
pond or something like.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:90%
That really happens.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:90%
That's not a joke.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.195 align:middle line:90%
This really, really happens.

00:23:00.195 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, are you afraid?

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.347 align:middle line:90%
Are you afraid for yourself?

00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:02.971 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: No.

00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting shot
at all the time.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.501 align:middle line:90%
My car has been bombed.

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, George, you know this.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.275 align:middle line:90%
You know me.

00:23:07.275 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You see me with my
bodyguards and stuff

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
like that at the house, Freda
Maxwell's or wherever we speak.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, I get
death threats on a daily basis,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
because I can cure everybody
from cancer that is still

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.259 align:middle line:84%
functional, and does
what I tell them

00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to do-- It has no
medical treatment--

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I can cure everybody, to
help them cure into 16 weeks.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee that.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it go too far?

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Can someone have cancer that
is so widespread in the body

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
anybody can do?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.996 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:23:36.996 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
if you're not
functional anymore,

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.934 align:middle line:84%
if it's infested the organs
to a certain extent--

00:23:41.934 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then it's too late.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.933 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: --the brain
to a certain extent,

00:23:44.933 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
if there is physical damage
done by the cancerous growths

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and accumulation of
the growths, it's

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
usually just a pressure that's
really causing the problem.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, I
have really seen colleagues

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
doing really miracle work and
getting people off a death bed.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
There are so many opportunities
and possibilities out there,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and we just need to try.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says you have
three months to live,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
what in the world do you have
to lose by trying anything?

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.657 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll do everything,
not just anything, everything.

00:24:14.657 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Exactly.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.573 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to answer
your question, George,

00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
why we don't have a cure.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a cure because
it's all about money.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If you cure yourself
with laetrile,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:90%
it costs you about $21.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:90%
$21 will do the job.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C, zinc, turmeric,
we all know these elements.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It is so simple and
easy oliander soup.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But most of all,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.465 align:middle line:84%
this is still just
treatment of the symptoms.

00:24:39.465 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: If you don't
get rid of the root

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
cause and my instinct-based
medicine system

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
goes only to identify
the root cause

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and eliminates the
root cause that

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
led to the malfunction
in the body.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
touch the tumor.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
It disappears anyway in a
very short amount of time.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The second you're
congruent with yourself,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you know you are somebody,
you know you love yourself,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:90%
you know you respect yourself.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:90%
You have self-confidence.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:90%
You're able to hug yourself.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You're able to look into
the mirror and you say,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.365 align:middle line:90%
I like what I see.

00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
all heard stories

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of people who have been to
their doctor, been x-rayed,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and they tell them you've
got a golf ball-sized tumor.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:90%
It's malignant.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we
can really do for you.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
The person comes back three
weeks later, three months later

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
after practicing some
natural alternative ways,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor says to him,
I can't find the tumor.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.171 align:middle line:90%
What the heck happened?

00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: He got divorced
or she got divorced.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, every physician
that is 20 years in office

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
or longer has seen cases
of spontaneous healing.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession, so
Dr. Simoncini and others,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr, Gary Null has a cure
rate of 2%, 2% to 3%,

medical profession.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I found out with a
lot of colleagues

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
27% of all cancer
patients get cured

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:90%
with doing absolutely nothing.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:90%

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.321 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they changed
something in their head,

00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
just changed something
in their lifestyle

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and behavioral patterns,
whatever it might be,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:90%
but they are cured.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So they kill
already the 25% with

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
the medical
professional treatment.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
They kill the 25% that would
have recovered on their own.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: And I don't even
want to mention on TV my cancer

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
cure rate because
nobody would believe it,

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
but it is so far
superior of that,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and basically, the only cancer
patients I personally ever lost

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
were people that had
treatment before I took them

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
on and thought maybe
I can do something.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But I never lost a cancer
patient in my life.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.645 align:middle line:84%
I have seen 35,000
cancer patients.

00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll die
of something else.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: They die
of something else.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.039 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you really go
for the root cause,

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't cost anything.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So the pharmaceutical
industry, and I'm originally

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, so the
pharmaceutical industry,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
they are all based in Germany,
so car bombing and things

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
like this was kind of
like my daily lifestyle.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So it is just really important
that people understand

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
cures out there,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
but you need to help
people like Dr. Burzynski

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
with the highest cure rate for
cancerous brain tumors, which

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:84%
actually are caused mainly by
your fillings in the teeth,

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the mercury fillings in the
teeth, the silver fillings.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:90%
It's quick silver.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's mercury.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, Leonard,
when we come back,

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about how
people can prevent cancer

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
from starting in
the first place.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.245 align:middle line:84%
Tell us all the things we need
to do, some of the supplements

00:27:36.245 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:90%
we should take.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back in just a
moment on Beyond Belief.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:45.526 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.526 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
to Beyond Belief

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Leonard Coldwell.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Leonard, let's prevent
cancer from starting

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Give us a regiment
of what people should

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
do to at least build
up that immunity

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and fight the possibility
of coming down with cancer.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
First of all, cancer is
not genetic, otherwise,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I would have cancer.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in my
history has cancer.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't have cancer,
and I never get cancer.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the easiest way to
prevent you have clear goals.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You make a
goal-setting workshop,

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and you set your goals
really, really far ahead.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to hear
people telling you about you

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and your life on your
90th birthday party.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And imagine yourself being
fit and vital and healthy and

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
strong and looking back
on a life of fulfillment.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Because a life of
fulfillment, George,

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
will prevent you from any bad
thing happening to your health.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So we need to, most of all,
have the main cause or the end

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:90%
cause of death is dehydration.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.180 align:middle line:84%
That means the second we die,
everybody dies of dehydration.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Ladies, dehydration is the
nearly only cause for wrinkles.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So it might help them to get to
the gallon of water with a half

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a teaspoon of pink salt in it
a day, because the pink salt,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:84%
first of all, you cannot
have sea salt anymore

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:90%
because of Fukushima.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all radioactive.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't touch that.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So pink salt is
mined Himalayan salt

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and you use half a teaspoon.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Still it's mined, so
it's completely clean.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it has
still all 76 trace minerals

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.020 align:middle line:84%
in it that you really
need for a healthy body.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Buy a juicer.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Have a gallon of water a
day and use the sea salt,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
but the main thing
is really that you

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:90%
are congruent with yourself.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Stop making compromises
against yourself.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.924 align:middle line:90%
You need to love your life.

00:29:33.924 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:84%
You need to get up in
the morning and you say,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I am somebody.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do that
and you look into the mirror

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and you say, wow.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:84%
That is the attitude
that keeps you healthy.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Because remember every illness
is based on lack of energy.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.740 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
thing that makes

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.480 align:middle line:90%
you sick than lack of energy.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you have self-esteem
and self-confidence,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
find out all these
parts in your life

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
congruent with yourself.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You do things you
don't want to do.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:84%
The person that calls
you every morning

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
3 o'clock in the morning
whining in your ear

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and telling you
the horror stories

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and never listen to what
you tell them to do,

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:90%
get rid of them.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the energy
drainers in your life.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Make a big list.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Write on top the ones that has
to go, and then make sure they

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
are going because there is not
one negative person in my life.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:84%
There is not one energy
drainer in my life.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's the most important
part from that angle.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.920 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you have
to have supplementation.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
volvic, meaning coming

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:90%
from volcanic ash minerals.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way to
really get minerals.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You should have silica, which is
the original form of nutrition

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%
of calcium.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It's basically Jurassic,
so that's really wonderful.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
That really can help you to
stay alkalined, get alkalined.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to do a lot
of systemic cleanses.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.195 align:middle line:90%
Never do a single-organ cleanse.

00:30:50.195 --> 00:30:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It can kill you, because it
pulls all the toxins you might

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
be already at the problem
level with your toxicity.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might do a
single-organ cleanse,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and all the toxins are going
to be put into your system.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
That might drop that
spills the barrel,

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and you might get terribly sick.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very important.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, 86% of
all illness and doctor visits

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:90%
are stress related.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has stress.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.966 align:middle line:84%
That's not the problem,
and that's good.

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have stress
for 24 hours, we're dead.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So stress is a good thing, but
the negative stress has to go,

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and it can go easily the way
you start evaluating the life

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:90%
situation in your head.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my stress
reduction system, as you know,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is the most endorsed and
most sold of all times.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm
endorsing that,

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot of good
techniques out there.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.472 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
turmeric, which I love.

00:31:44.472 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Tumeric
is just unbelievable.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.554 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
a good fighter

00:31:47.554 --> 00:31:49.550 align:middle line:84%
even if you have
the flu or cold,

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and often Christian Wilde is
really, really big into that,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and people should look that up.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And it is very important.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's an inflammation fighter,
and everything negative,

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
every permanent damage even from
rheumatoid arthritis and all

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:84%
these elements are
based on inflammation,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.519 align:middle line:84%
and turmeric is an unbelievable
inflammation fighter,

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's really, really
good for cancer patients.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
amazing the things

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.666 align:middle line:84%
you can do to help
your body fight cancer.

00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's another thing I
found though, Leonard.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that we talk to,
some of my own family members,

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
one of which has stage
four brain cancer, never

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
listen to me for
the alternative.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
always conventional.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if
it was voodoo to talk

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:90%
about these unconventional ways.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
How do you get through
to people like that?

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: You don't.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Actually, you really don't.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a cousin that I grew up
with, saw me curing my mother,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:84%
saw me curing my sister from
cervical cancer and my mother

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:84%
from liver cancer, saw me
curing all these people.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I get a phone call last year.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Herbie is dead, and I said,
did he get run over by a truck?

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:90%
He died of cancer.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Never called, never
asked anything.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.140 align:middle line:90%
So here is the thing.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
You drive yourself
nuts by trying

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to convince somebody
that doesn't want help.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They are so in the hands of the
manipulation of the mass media,

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:90%
in the medical profession.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And you need to understand
doctors are all good people.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.550 align:middle line:90%
They have no other choice.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:84%
By law, they have to use
chemotherapy, radiation,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and surgery with a
cancer patient by law

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:84%
or they go to jail, or they
lose their license, or both.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You can only-- it's like
they say, don't try to teach

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
a pig to sing.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You annoy the pig and
you drive yourself nuts.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is really what it is.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
You can never convince somebody.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is open.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
See that's why I have these
free videos on to my TV site,

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
on the website where people
get 10-minute snippets of what

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I have to say.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
helps if you have

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.671 align:middle line:84%
somebody that doesn't
want to listen.

00:33:54.671 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
You know the prophet
in its own land.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't listen to you.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.730 align:middle line:84%
You're the daughter or
the wife or the husband.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't listen to you.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you put the laptop
on the table, it's all free.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Push on one of my videos, and
have them just listening to me

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
talk about cancer,
potential cancer cures,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and all these elements.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
over time, they think,

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that might be something
and then you have them.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
second they open up,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:90%
then you can help them fill in.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You put them on a juicing
diet, and all of a sudden

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.194 align:middle line:84%
after three days of
really bad diarrhea,

00:34:29.194 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:84%
if you do the right thing,
with the juicing celery, apple,

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%
carrot once each in the morning
and you're really toxic,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:84%
you will have spent a lot
of time in the restroom,

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.759 align:middle line:84%
but you know it's working, and
you know how toxic you are.

00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That won't
work if you're

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:84%
doing a four-hour
live radio show.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.668 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It's
not for you, George.

00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
something that I

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:90%
think so many people need to do.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.982 align:middle line:84%
They need to take
care of themselves.

00:34:53.982 --> 00:34:54.690 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.139 align:middle line:84%
You can't get through to people
who don't want to listen.

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: No, you can't,
because they shut off.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Professor Robert Rosenthal
conducted a study and said

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:84%
whenever you believe something,
you can do something or believe

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:90%
you can't.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It shuts off or turns
on the brain parts that

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for it,
and you're always right.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So the second you believe
that doesn't work,

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.737 align:middle line:84%
it shuts off all the
possibilities and information.

00:35:17.737 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
people say, oh, you

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.861 align:middle line:84%
have never told me
that, and you keep

00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
on telling them the same thing
for the last three years.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over again.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Because their
brain was just blocked.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So you need to find
an opening somewhere,

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
or the good thing is
also testimonials.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You have somebody that has
been cured from something,

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and you let them
talk to these people.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We have all the video
testimonials on my websites

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
so that people really
understand where I'm coming from

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and that it works, and I'm
not the one that can heal you.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I have tens of thousands of
thank you emails and letters.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
People are saying, I took your
book The Only Answer to Cancer

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and cured myself by just
using these simple things

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned in this book.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.386 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
is so phenomenal.

00:36:01.386 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You know we got
284,000 emails-- I

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.731 align:middle line:84%
was the first time on your
show-- 284,000 emails within

00:36:07.731 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:90%
three hours.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.950 align:middle line:84%
They shut off all of
our systems, and I mean,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:84%
my websites were
dead for two weeks

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:84%
because so many people were
flooding to the websites.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the impact
you have, George,

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
where people need
to understand more.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not just I am under
fire, it's George also

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and everybody involved.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.366 align:middle line:84%
We are the freedom
fighters out there.

00:36:28.366 --> 00:36:30.170 align:middle line:90%
We were all kooks back then.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we started,
we were the weird ones.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:84%
How can you cure anything or do
anything just with your mind?

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we are out
there to educate people,

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
we do this also for your loved
ones so that you can say, OK.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Just listen to them talk for
half an hour or for an hour.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Just watch this TV show.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Just watch it.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Do me a favor.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Just watch it.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And the second they
open up a little bit,

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:90%
that changes everything.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To me, one of the
most heartbreaking episodes

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of all of this is when a little
child comes down with cancer.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Yeah.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.836 align:middle line:84%
And it's 99% caused
by the vaccination.

00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so?

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.286 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: I know so.

00:37:12.286 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: First
of all, vaccination

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is the only cause for autism,
and I can explain to you

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.220 align:middle line:84%
scientifically really
fast how it works.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:84%
There is not one
autistic child out there

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that has not been vaccinated.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.314 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, every child that's
autistic has been vaccinated.

00:37:27.314 --> 00:37:28.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --has been vaccinated.

00:37:28.605 --> 00:37:29.105 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:29.105 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: So it can only
be caused by vaccination.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.824 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way.

00:37:32.824 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
would have children

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.625 align:middle line:84%
that have not been
vaccinated with autism.

00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not every
child who's vaccinated

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.687 align:middle line:84%
will be artistic, but
every autistic child

00:37:40.687 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:90%
has been vaccinated.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But we are all
kind of like maybe

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:90%
artistic to a certain extent.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
We all have this brain
fog once in awhile.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.484 align:middle line:90%
Is this normal or not?

00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know--

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: --because
with every vaccination,

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.538 align:middle line:90%
your IQ goes down two points.

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I probably
had early vaccinations

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.925 align:middle line:90%
when we were kids.

00:37:58.925 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: They were
not all bad then.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our parents
didn't know much.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.987 align:middle line:90%
They weren't good, were they?

00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: No, they were
not good, but not as bad

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
as today where they
have live cancer viruses

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.812 align:middle line:84%
in the vaccine,
microchips in the vaccine.

00:38:10.812 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Through the syringe,
you get a microchip.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
All American soldiers are
microchipped with the vaccines.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The Gulf War syndrome,
in my opinion,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
was only caused by
the vaccines they

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.467 align:middle line:84%
gave all of these poor soldiers
and not by anything else.

00:38:24.467 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, a lot
of people believe that.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.258 align:middle line:84%
Leonard, we're going to
take some more listener

00:38:28.258 --> 00:38:30.400 align:middle line:90%
responses and viewers also.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Lets talk.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Question for Dr. Coldwell?

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.532 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:38:34.532 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
small children.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:84%
What would you recommend as
far as a vaccination schedule

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of any kind or absolutely
no vaccinations?

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a tough
question, Leonard,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and also you've got
school systems that

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
will create a living, horrible
situation for you if you don't

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:90%
get vaccinated for your kids.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.185 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:38:56.185 --> 00:38:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: I would never,
ever vaccinate a child.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I would never, ever
get my child vaccinated

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.060 align:middle line:90%
under no circumstances.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:84%
First of all, all
schools have waivers,

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
they just don't
tell you about it.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Just go to the internet,
waivers for vaccination.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.436 align:middle line:90%
Your kid can go to school.

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:13.894 align:middle line:84%
They cannot keep
you out of school.

00:39:13.894 --> 00:39:14.852 align:middle line:90%
It's completely absurd.

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:15.542 align:middle line:90%
It's a myth.

00:39:15.542 --> 00:39:17.689 align:middle line:84%
If you ask for it, they
say they don't have it.

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
If you tell them to give it to
you, they give you the waiver.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Just sign it and it's done.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
really, really absurd.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:84%
How can your child be
a danger for the others

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.390 align:middle line:84%
if vaccination works and
they're all vaccinated?

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:84%
How can your child
that's not vaccinated

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:90%
be a danger to the others?

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
fear of a parent

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is, I don't want
to make a mistake.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:84%
If this is my child's
life at stake,

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:84%
what if some vaccines work and
I haven't given it to them?

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's a quandary.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: They
absolutely don't work.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Vaccination is an assault
with a deadly weapon.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You have formaldehyde, you have
quick silver mercury in it.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:90%
You have dioxin in it.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You have all these
toxins in it including

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:84%
live cancer viruses, so how
can you not damage your child?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It might not come up within the
next five, or six, seven, eight

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:84%
years, but it will
come up one day.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And now they give them
up to 28 vaccinations

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.032 align:middle line:84%
just in the early
stages of childhood,

00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and now they have all
these booster shots

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and all these
combination vaccines.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you,
there's so much

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:84%
information out there, if
you really Google it and also

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
in my book How to Survive
Your Illness and Your Doctor,

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.320 align:middle line:84%
have chapters in there
that explain to you

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:84%
why you should never
vaccinate a child,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:84%
why you should never
get vaccinated.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They vaccinate
pregnant women now.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.840 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago they said, under
no circumstances vaccinate them,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.796 align:middle line:84%
because they want a sick
child or the mother to abort.

00:40:44.796 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
The GARDASIL vaccine,
the vaccination

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
against the HPV virus,
which supposedly

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:90%
causes cervical cancer.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:56.590 align:middle line:84%
First of all, cervical cancer,
a watery solution with sodium

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.510 align:middle line:84%
bicarbonate, the woman does a
douche a couple of times a day.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Flush it later.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't stay in there,
and it's gone in three days.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:90%
So it is not even a problem.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.680 align:middle line:84%
The GARDASIL vaccine
has only been

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:84%
created for population control
to make all these girls

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.200 align:middle line:90%
infertile.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Tens of thousands of girls
dropped with the needle

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
still in them in
the doctor's office.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:90%
There is death.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:84%
There is neurological
damage proven.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That is not a
conspiracy, George.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.224 align:middle line:84%
The scientific facts are so
massive behind all of this,

00:41:28.224 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at the
facts that's out there.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Just look at facts.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't let them tell
you what they think,

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.345 align:middle line:90%
or what could or should be.

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:84%
All of this doesn't matter,
that's why I'm always saying,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
talk to people that produce
results, not scientists

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.374 align:middle line:84%
in a laboratory
that say, oh, if you

00:41:43.374 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:90%
do this, that should happen.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm waiting
for the next virus,

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:84%
the next disease to come out
where they will then say,

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
we've got this
wonderful vaccine.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Everybody needs to get it.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: That's how they
kill off the elderly with a flu

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
vaccine, because they don't
want to pay Social Security.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they tell
the elderly get vaccinated.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And they die, in my opinion,
10, 15 years earlier

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.760 align:middle line:90%
than they have to.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely no way
if you look at the science.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.360 align:middle line:84%
See, George, medicine is a
religion, it's not a science.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's always belief.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The doctor always says, I
believe it could be that.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe that could work.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a religion.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not science,
and people think

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:84%
because they use science
for diagnostic lab tests

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.879 align:middle line:84%
and they use science to find out
how your blood levels look like

00:42:32.879 --> 00:42:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and all these kind of
things, oh, that's science.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
That's science, but everything
following the diagnostic test,

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:84%
the physical diagnostic test
is just voodoo, nothing else.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just a shot in the dark.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I give you Cortisone and your
knee doesn't hurt anymore.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:48.925 align:middle line:90%
Of course, not.

00:42:48.925 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It's dead.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It turned into plastic.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hurt.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But in three months, your
knee is completely rotten

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and gone because it
did grind itself down.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look
at the facts, George,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that the medical profession is
the number one cause of death

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.040 align:middle line:84%
in America, and there are
enough studies out there that

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.440 align:middle line:90%
confirm that too.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stop believing
284,000 people a year at least

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.975 align:middle line:84%
dying of interactions
with medicines that

00:43:16.975 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:90%
are prescribed by their doctors.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.945 align:middle line:84%
The most deadly
infections that you

00:43:21.945 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:84%
get, you get in your
hospitals, all these super bugs

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.020 align:middle line:84%
all based on all these
absurd antibiotics.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
If you have colloidal
silver, if you have zinc,

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't really need
antibiotics in my experience.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
There might be cases where
close to dying that's

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:90%
a different story.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You need to knock it off,
but otherwise, 35% food grade

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:84%
hydrogen peroxide,
I had a patient,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:84%
she got stung by something,
but we don't know what it is,

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and the stinger was
still in the skin.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Like staph bacteria, it
started to really eating away

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and just have a pouring
35% food grade hydrogen

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
peroxide in there, and
of course, every doctor

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:84%
said she's going to die, and
they're going to rot away,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and after three
days, it closed up.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:90%
So they don't make money on it.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.585 align:middle line:84%
If you buy a bottle
of hydrogen peroxide--

00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's $1.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It's $1.50

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: It's nothing.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.316 align:middle line:84%
I wish you were a
little more passionate

00:44:15.316 --> 00:44:17.342 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
doing, Leonard.

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come back in
just a moment on Beyond Belief.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:90%
More with Dr. Leonard Coldwell.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't go away.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.434 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:44:23.434 --> 00:44:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
with Beyond Belief.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with Dr.
Leonard Coldwell author,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:84%
of course, the bestselling
book The Only Answer to Cancer.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
When you first did this,
it sold like hotcakes.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:90%
What edition are you into now?

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: We're in the 16th
edition now within 25 months.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We sold over 2 million books--

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.762 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:44:49.762 --> 00:44:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: --and
the original book

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
was called Mama Please
Don't Die, which is still

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.050 align:middle line:84%
a mega bestseller
today in Europe.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is just, of course, an
updated version with my story

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
in it and explaining to
people how easy it is to do.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the first
edition of 250,000

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:84%
sold out before it
was on the market.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.159 align:middle line:84%
We put it on the website,
and it was completely--

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.366 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: --sold
out in the first day.

00:45:12.366 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want to
take care of themselves.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, as I tell my
three kids-- all grown,

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.350 align:middle line:84%
they all have their own
little kids-- there's nothing

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.725 align:middle line:84%
more important in
life than taking care

00:45:22.725 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:84%
of your health and the
people you care about.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.558 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:45:25.558 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't care about the
kind of income stream you have

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.620 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.080 align:middle line:84%
If you aren't taking
care of your health,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.175 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost,
what good is life?

00:45:35.175 --> 00:45:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It is
the same, George,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:90%
as they tell you in the plane.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.130 align:middle line:84%
When the oxygen
mask come down, they

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
tell you put your own
oxygen mask on first

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and then help your children
because what good are you

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.065 align:middle line:84%
for you children laying on
the floor gasping for oxygen.

00:45:47.065 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.076 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: It doesn't help.

00:45:49.076 --> 00:45:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You cannot pull somebody out
of quicksand if you jump after

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:90%
that person.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to create stable ground
underneath your feet first

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you grab the person,
and then you pull them out.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take care-- to be
a good mother, father, sister,

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.980 align:middle line:84%
brother, a spouse,
husband, wife.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You need to take care
of yourself first.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:90%
That is the most important part.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I take care of me for you
and you take care of yourself

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.270 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.610 align:middle line:90%
That should be the sentence.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.979 align:middle line:84%
So everybody needs to
take care of themselves.

00:46:18.979 --> 00:46:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Stop the self-pity party.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so sick.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:21.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Just skip it.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Get off the sofa
and do something.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I am somebody.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I can do this, so I have this
problem, I'm going to fix it.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And my books, all 19 books
are help to self-help books,

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is why they're
selling so much.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the people
want to have knowledge.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.635 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to be like
supervised or controlled

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:90%
like by the government.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.842 align:middle line:84%
No, they want to have
education, but easy and simple

00:46:48.842 --> 00:46:49.425 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:46:49.425 --> 00:46:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: I learned from
my great friend Zig Ziglar,

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.850 align:middle line:84%
you write on a
seventh-grade level.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.750 align:middle line:84%
If a seventh grader
can understand it,

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:90%
even a professor can.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: So it is
just really important

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not writing books
to impress my colleagues.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know a foreign word.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.791 align:middle line:84%
I know a really long,
really complicated word.

00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:07.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing my books
for you and you and you,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.750 align:middle line:84%
for each and every
one of us, and most

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.250 align:middle line:84%
of all that my mom
can understand it

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.110 align:middle line:84%
who only had a sixth grade
educational level because she

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:84%
was a refugee after
the Second World War,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.690 align:middle line:84%
while my grandfather was in
a Nazi concentration camp.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So she basically had only
a sixth grade education.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.950 align:middle line:84%
She needs to be able
to understand that.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is so important.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not writing
books for myself,

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not writing
them like I write books.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing them like I speak
to you, like I give my seminars.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I have seen four million seminar
attendees live in my seminars.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.754 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I've
seen you in seminars.

00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:42.232 align:middle line:90%
People flock to you.

00:47:42.232 --> 00:47:43.315 align:middle line:90%
They want the information.

00:47:43.315 --> 00:47:45.945 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Because they want
help to self help, George.

00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:48.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking of self help,
what have you brought us here?

00:47:48.772 --> 00:47:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: OK, George.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The most important
part is detoxification.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Physical detoxification,
there is two elements, one,

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of course, is my
stress reduction set,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:84%
which your viewers get
a special discount on,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand, you
need to physically detoxify.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:07.080 align:middle line:84%
You cannot build on swampy,
dirty, ugly bad ground,

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:90%
a new body.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That means when I figured out
that a lot of cancer patients

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:84%
got worse by doing
single-organ cleanses,

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.200 align:middle line:90%
a huge problem occurred.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.000 align:middle line:90%
They dropped like flies.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, wait a second.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:20.910 align:middle line:90%
What happens here?

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:26.466 align:middle line:84%
So it took me 27 years to refine
with sciences, Dr. Crone who

00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is a leading expert in Europe
for homeopathic medicine

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and natural medicine
and Dr. Hohn, who

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.096 align:middle line:84%
is the expert in Germany, a
medical doctor but also an NMD.

00:48:37.096 --> 00:48:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And they helped me
to create something

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that detoxifies the cells
individually, all cells

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.000 align:middle line:84%
at the same time in
a very calming way

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and also puts instantly
nutrition in so

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that the cell is
instantly alkalined.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So all these other cleanses,
they empty you out.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you have an even a huger a
bigger nutritional deficiency.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.825 align:middle line:84%
That is where the main
problem is coming from.

00:49:01.825 --> 00:49:03.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many people
get sick doing a cleanse.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't feel
sick doing a cleanse.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:90%
So you need to be prepared.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a five-day that
prepares you for the cleanse.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It gives you upfront nutrition.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It opens up your cells.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that
cellulite is not fat?

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Cellulite are stored
toxins in your fat cells.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You can starve to death, you
will still have the cellulite,

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.231 align:middle line:84%
because the body will not
let go of the toxins that's

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:28.230 align:middle line:90%
stored in the fat cells.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:90%
That's cellulite.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Cellulite is not fat.

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to go
directly into the system

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to directly
detoxify the system

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
from the inside out and
everything at the same time.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.771 align:middle line:84%
It includes-- people say,
oh, it's a colon cleanse.

00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:43.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.769 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:43.769 --> 00:49:46.275 align:middle line:84%
It just includes a colon
cleanse because everything

00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of the cells has
to go out as fast as possible.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And we need to really
make sure, and this

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.220 align:middle line:90%
is why it needs to be a system.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a 21-day system.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Every cleanse below 21
days is damaging you.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.350 align:middle line:90%
It will not hurt you.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It will never do anything
for you on long term.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible because every
human change takes 21 days.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.074 align:middle line:84%
If you're not 21 days
in detoxification mode,

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:12.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't build
the dendrites, you

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.509 align:middle line:84%
don't build the neurons to be
detoxified and stay that way.

00:50:15.509 --> 00:50:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It takes that
kind of time for your body

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:18.732 align:middle line:90%
to do what it's going to do.

00:50:18.732 --> 00:50:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Yeah.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And it even goes back to
Ivan Pavlov's experiment

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.150 align:middle line:84%
with the dogs, 21
times ringing the bell

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.295 align:middle line:90%
and it created a stimulus.

00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:29.420 align:middle line:90%
But it's really important--

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 21-gun salute.

00:50:31.766 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: That's what it is.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But it is really, you cannot
just take the same pill all day

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:37.310 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:37.520 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.144 align:middle line:84%
You're different in
the morning, so you

00:50:39.144 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:84%
start with the morning
detoxification.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's completely different
in the afternoon.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.330 align:middle line:84%
You have a specific afternoon,
you have a specific evening.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you stop
your cleansing,

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
most important part,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.840 align:middle line:84%
now everything needs
to be restored.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a
five-day restoration

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.140 align:middle line:84%
of your colon of all the
probiotics and everything.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But every single time
you get volvic minerals,

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.802 align:middle line:84%
which means they
are bioavailable.

00:51:04.802 --> 00:51:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you swallow a stone,

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.540 align:middle line:84%
it comes out the same way
that you swallowed it.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what you're doing is
building up the immune system.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Absolutely.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not toxic,
your body physically cannot get

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.590 align:middle line:84%
ill, and if you're alkaline
and that's what this cleanse is

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.690 align:middle line:84%
made for, if you are alkaline,
you cannot develop cancer,

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and cancer cannot exist or
grow or develop in an alkaline,

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.300 align:middle line:90%
oxygen-rich environment.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.675 align:middle line:84%
It gives you oxygen because
it has chlorophyll in it.

00:51:29.675 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the minerals
to build your new body,

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.565 align:middle line:84%
and your new sells after
it took out the poisons.

00:51:34.565 --> 00:51:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the secret is to
get these new cells to come in

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.160 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: --and be
alkaline from the beginning.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --from the beginning.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: That is why
it's so important you

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.650 align:middle line:90%
eat a lot of eggs.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of cholesterol.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.065 align:middle line:84%
The higher your cholesterol,
the healthier you are,

00:51:47.065 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:90%
the longer you live.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:49.540 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.190 align:middle line:84%
My doctor said lower
your cholesterol.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: Well, your
doctor is an idiot.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So basically, 87%
of all new cells

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.450 align:middle line:90%
are built from cholesterol.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is nearly 100%,
it's 99% cholesterol.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.950 align:middle line:84%
You take Lipitor,
the statin drugs

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to lower your cholesterol,
you'll shrink your brain first.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what causes dementia
and all these kinds

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of things in my opinion.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So what you really
need to do is,

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to have-- in a
burn unit, for example,

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.730 align:middle line:84%
we gave burn victims 28
hard boiled eggs a day

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.970 align:middle line:84%
because we know that that
cholesterol builds the fastest

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:27.262 align:middle line:90%
healthiest cells.

00:52:27.262 --> 00:52:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So you will lower
your cholesterol,

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.553 align:middle line:90%
the younger you die.

00:52:29.553 --> 00:52:31.246 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely no doubt.

00:52:31.246 --> 00:52:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Your vision goes
down, everything

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.930 align:middle line:84%
goes down because you
live from cholesterol.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
LDL, HDL, it's not
even cholesterol.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It's transport mechanisms.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not cholesterol
what they tell you.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.805 align:middle line:84%
One transports the
good cholesterol in,

00:52:43.805 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and one transports
bad cholesterol out.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand that
if it comes from the mainstream

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.610 align:middle line:84%
media, I don't want to
name these people out.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a Dr. something
on TV, they are all crooks

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, being paid off
by the pharmaceutical industry,

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.040 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, you wouldn't
be on mainstream media.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:84%
See, if you're not
going with them

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.475 align:middle line:84%
and what their agenda
is, the new world order

00:53:08.475 --> 00:53:10.930 align:middle line:84%
agenda, the pharmaceutical
agenda, the medical agenda,

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:12.880 align:middle line:90%
you're not on TV.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.420 align:middle line:84%
You're only on TV because
you do exactly what they

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.330 align:middle line:90%
want you to do.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:90%
You're a sell out.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So don't watch these shows.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.415 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, George.

00:53:20.415 --> 00:53:22.156 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a passion, huh?

00:53:22.156 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: I'm sorry.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you always been
excited about stuff like this?

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Always.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Because see, my mom
had gallbladder stones

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.770 align:middle line:90%
when I was six.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
She had an emergency surgery,
and they gave her hepatitis C

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.220 align:middle line:84%
blood because it
messed up the surgery.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So then she developed liver
cirrhosis and liver cancer

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.270 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, I
had some bad experience.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:84%
My physical father
was very abusive

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and beat my sick
mother all the time.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, jeez.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: So I
was just looking

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.823 align:middle line:84%
for solutions, how I could
get rid of the guy, you know?

00:53:50.823 --> 00:53:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in martial arts since the
age of six defending my mom.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But what you need to do,
you don't achieve anything

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.650 align:middle line:84%
being in trance,
being catatonic.

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.880 align:middle line:84%
You achieve things
because you are positive

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody
wants to be around you.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.120 align:middle line:84%
See, there are people
that can brighten up

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.600 align:middle line:90%
an entire room by leaving it.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to
be a negative person.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.949 align:middle line:84%
You want to brighten up a
room by walking into it.

00:54:13.949 --> 00:54:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
many times have we

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:18.520 align:middle line:84%
been in a room and
some vampire comes in?

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.875 align:middle line:90%
I call them energy vampires.

00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Exactly.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've
all seen that--

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Yeah.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where they
just shut down the place.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to be around them.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Most of these people don't
even know they are doing this,

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's sad.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had people
say to me, George,

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
why doesn't anybody
want to talk to me?

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they like me?

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that they
don't like them as people,

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
it's just that they have
huge negative energy.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COLDWELL: It is very often
a lot of self-pity involved.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Why did God do this to me?

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have such
a bad childhood?

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't I not born into
a billionaire's family,

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and had the life of a
lifetime from the beginning?

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It is very often just self-pity.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are so self-absorbed if
they just would look at people.

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:84%
See, I give three days,
eight-hours-a-day seminars

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.151 align:middle line:84%
and I never prepare because I
know what I'm talking about,

00:55:06.151 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at the people
and what the people need right

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:09.030 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:10.904 align:middle line:84%
People say, what are
you going to talk about?

00:55:10.904 --> 00:55:11.809 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I need to see the people.

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:14.492 align:middle line:84%
I need to feel
what you guys need.

00:55:14.492 --> 00:55:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you
never run out of energy.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.076 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Dr. Leonard Coldwell.

00:55:18.076 --> 00:55:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Leonard, thank you so much.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.474 align:middle line:90%
>>COLDWELL: Thank you so much.

00:55:20.474 --> 00:55:24.346 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:55:24.346 --> 00:55:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
since I was a little boy

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and I heard so many
stories of cancer

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and why it appears and
what happens to families,

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been obsessed with trying
to get the answers to help you

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.820 align:middle line:84%
fight this dreaded
affliction, this disease.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And people like Dr.
Leonard Coldwell

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.630 align:middle line:84%
are there to help you
too, and let's just

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:84%
hope that you'll take heed with
some of the things he said.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.830 align:middle line:90%
This is Beyond Belief.

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:11.167 align:middle line:90%
