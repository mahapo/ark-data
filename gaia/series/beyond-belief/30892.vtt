To be very spiritual, there
was one person on this planet

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
several thousand years
ago who had those answers,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and it was Jesus.

involved in the Shroud of Turin

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Research Project?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.161 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: You know, I asked
myself that very same question

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I operated a photographic
studio specializing

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in scientific, medical,
technical photography.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was approached
by an organization that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
was contracted to Los Alamos
National Laboratories,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and for seven
months they asked me

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to be a photographic consultant
on their project, which

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
was interesting.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.172 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was
about atomic bombs,

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and if I tell you any more,
I have to kill everybody.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's good.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.453 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: --we won't do that.

00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But after seven months,
that project ended,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and I went back to
my normal routine.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman I'd
worked with maybe three four

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
weeks later called
me up and he said,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Barrie, what do you know
about the Shroud of Turin?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed, and I said,
but, Don, I'm Jewish.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And Don laughed because he
said, so am I. Remember?

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Because he also was one of the
Jewish members of the team.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But to be more serious,
he explained to me

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that some new properties
of the Shroud's image

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
had been visualized for the
first time by some scientists

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
over at Sandia Laboratories,
a sister lab to Los Alamos.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of explained
those properties to me.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately was
curious, because I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
knew that those
were not properties

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
that could be incorporated
into a photographic image

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.904 align:middle line:90%
or into an artwork.

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And without getting
too technical,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:84%
it was the fact that
the lights and darks

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of the image of the
Shroud are directly

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
proportionate to the distance
between the cloth and the body.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not something
you can do photographically

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
or any other way that
I was familiar with,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
so of course I was very
curious about this image.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
But I was also
very uncomfortable,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.809 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised in
an orthodox Jewish home,

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
very much like
"Fiddler on the Roof,"

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
my mother and father
born in Poland.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:90%
My grandparents lived with us.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
much about Jesus.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was
Jewish, but I really

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.627 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any emotional
attachment to the subject.

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it came to the Shroud,
even though I understood

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
it had this unique property,
I was still pretty convinced

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.972 align:middle line:84%
that we would get to Turin
and I would take a look at it,

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and I would see the paint
and the brush strokes

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and come home.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was frankly thinking,
oh, free trip to Italy.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.495 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So of course,
that was not exactly how it all

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
ended up.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.964 align:middle line:84%
But I did participate
in the examination

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Shroud over a period
of five days and nights.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I did hold it in my own hands.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I kind
of got trapped into it.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I did try and quit at one point.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
other team members,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Don Linn of the Jet Propulsion
Lab, may he rest in peace,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
he was a man in charge of
imaging on Voyager and Viking

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and Mariner and
Galileo projects.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He knew
what he was doing.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.975 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: My
hero on the team,

00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
because this was a
real imaging expert,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
from NASA of all places.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So he was the one
that sort of convinced

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%
me to stay on the team.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I said to him one
day, gee, Don, what's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.983 align:middle line:84%
a nice Jewish boy
like me doing here?

00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me, and he
said kind of the same thing.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
He says, well,
have you forgotten

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the man in question's a Jew?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.801 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I know that.

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh,
you don't think God

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
wants one of his chosen
people on our team?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, then I laughed.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.477 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I
never thought that.

00:04:31.477 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And then he gave me some advice.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, you never know
in advance what the plan is.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Go to Turin, do the best job
you can do, and, in the end,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:90%
one day you'll understand why.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I listened to
him-- thank goodness

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I did-- and stayed on that team.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share one more
quick thing about that.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I felt very privileged
to be in that room.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
There were a billion
people on this planet who

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
had more right to
be there than I did.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I understand.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And yet for some
reason I was the guy that was

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
put there to be the documenting
photographer and record

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
the event and do some of
the scientific work as well.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I finished
with it all, I

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:90%
felt a certain responsibility.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.926 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
feel mystical, Barrie?

00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I didn't.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.205 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certain that's because
I didn't have any emotional--

00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ties to it.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: --ties to it.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.636 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I know that some
of the team members who were

00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Christian, I'm sure they did
and felt much more an emotional

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:90%
response than I did.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:90%
But I was very neutral about it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, it didn't
matter much to me.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus didn't really mean
anything emotionally to me.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have that attachment.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But they say that Jews and
Catholics have cornered

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
the market on guilt,
and I was feeling guilty

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
when it was all finished that
I had somehow not finished

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:90%
what I'd begun.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt that somehow
I had an obligation.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I was given a privilege
to be in that room,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and I felt that my obligation
was to fulfill that

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.101 align:middle line:84%
by somehow sharing this
information with a broader

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.179 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that's
what I've done.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's go back to
the beginning of the Shroud,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Barrie.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was crucified.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.415 align:middle line:90%
They wrapped him in this linen.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Correct.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Pick it up from there.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So he
is wrapped in linen.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to make clear that he
was not wrapped like a mummy.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Although I know in the Gospels
it talks about strips of linen.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
But as you'll see later, when
you wrap the shroud lengthwise

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
around a body, if you
try to move the body

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
the cloth's just going
to fall right off anyway.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So they would take
strips of linen, then,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.246 align:middle line:84%
and once the body was
wrapped into the cloth

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
they would wrap strips
around the chest

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and the waist and
the feet so that when

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the body, if it
were to be moved,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%
the cloth would stay in place.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
When my father died in 2003, he
had an orthodox Jewish burial,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.822 align:middle line:84%
plain wooden coffin,
no embalming.

00:06:48.822 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Simple.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Very simple.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.433 align:middle line:84%
And he was wrapped in
a very similar shroud.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The only difference was it
had been sewn along the edges.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
being open, it

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
was more like a
mummy bag would be,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
if you're familiar with camping.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And for Jesus, it was
put on the bottom and the top,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: He was laid into
it with his feet at one end,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
his head in the center, and
then it was wrapped over--

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Pulled right over him.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --the body
back down to his feet.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And kind of just
dropped right on him right?

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Exactly.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And although it mentions these
strips of linen in the Gospel--

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
because remember, it
was Friday evening.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The Sabbath was
fast approaching.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
There was no question
that it was forbidden

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to work on the Sabbath, and
they didn't have digital clocks.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So as the sun went down,
they were pressed for time.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
They did not complete
the burial preparations

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%
as would have been normal.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And the
intent was to come back.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.473 align:middle line:84%
And I think it says so
in the New Testament.

00:07:41.473 --> 00:07:43.186 align:middle line:84%
The intent was to
come back on Sunday

00:07:43.186 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to complete what they hadn't
been able to complete Friday

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
evening.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ah, what a surprise
for them on Sunday, huh?

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, I never
argue where the body went,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
so I don't feel that
that's my place.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they
put him in the tomb.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They
put him in a tomb.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They roll a pretty
large rock in front of it,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and Roman Centurions are
guarding the tomb, right?

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's correct.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Three days
later, what happens?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, apparently--
Let me qualify the three days.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the time frame, it

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.859 align:middle line:84%
was actually only
about 36 hours.

00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.066 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: But in
the Jewish calendar,

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
when the Sabbath begins
on sundown on Saturday,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.324 align:middle line:90%
that's the second day.

00:08:17.324 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And then the morning--

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.095 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then
the morning of.

00:08:19.095 --> 00:08:19.845 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So really it was about
36 hours, perhaps.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.522 align:middle line:84%
But on the third day,
obviously they go to the tomb.

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:90%
The tomb is open.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
The body's gone.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.027 align:middle line:84%
And as I said a
moment ago, I don't

00:08:29.027 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
argue where the body went.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
the body went.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I assume the
Centurions were there all

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
the time, right?

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.464 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well,
that I'm not sure of.

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm sure that
it talks about that

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.004 align:middle line:90%
in the New Testament.

00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
Not being a New
Testament scholar,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.004 align:middle line:84%
I have to sort of proclaim
my ignorance in places.

00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid to say
even on television

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know the
answer to that specifically.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The body is gone.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:90%
The Shroud is where?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: The Shroud
remains in place.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And many people who are
skeptical of the Shroud

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
point out that in the Gospels
it talks about two cloths.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It says there was the
Shroud, and then there

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
was the one cloth folded
and separate from the other.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
That would've been
the face cloth.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Even today it's
still very common.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's killed
in an accident,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.015 align:middle line:84%
the very first thing we
do is cover their face.

00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:12.681 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: It's a tradition
that goes back even prior

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to the Jewish
tradition, I believe.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It probably goes
back to pagan times.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what they would have

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
done would have been as he
was brought off the cross,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.762 align:middle line:84%
they would have immediately
covered his face.

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then once he was
brought to the tomb,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.761 align:middle line:90%
they would have separated that.

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But they would've kept it there,
because Jewish law requires

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that any blood-soaked cloth
be buried with the body.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So it would
have been in the tomb.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It would have been separate
from the main burial shroud.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact, if you
look into the New Testament,

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about this,
there are many people who

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
reject the Shroud saying,
well, there are two cloths.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
The Shroud is one.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people are not
aware that there

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
is a face cloth called
the Sudarium of Oviedo.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
It's in Oviedo, Spain.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
It is a blood and
fluid-soaked cloth.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You can see where the
nose and the mouth were.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It had been wrapped
around a man's head.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the blood
stains on the Sudarium

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.389 align:middle line:84%
match some of the blood
stains on the head

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
of the Man of the Shroud.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now was that from the
crucifixion and the cloth they

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
put over his head?

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Or was that the woman
who wiped his face?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Ah, the Veronica.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.889 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: That is a legend.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence of that,
and it's not really mentioned--

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.335 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The Veil of Veronica.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.251 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: The Veil
of Veronica is a legend,

00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:90%
not mentioned in the gospels.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.015 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was from
some letters that

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
were written by some of
the disciples or someone

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, but it's not
mentioned in the gospels.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
What is mentioned, of course,
is the shroud and the face

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:84%
cloth, both of which
still exist to this day.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I actually was given the
privilege a year ago,

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.327 align:middle line:84%
I was in Spain,
and they actually

00:10:51.327 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
opened up the reliquarium
and the reliquary,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:90%
and they showed me the Sudarium.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
fascinating about it

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is that there's blood
stains on it that

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
are consistent and
shaped the same

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
as some of the blood stains
on the Man of the Shroud.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can you see a face?

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: There's no face.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.406 align:middle line:84%
But you could see where
the nose and the mouth

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
were, because there's
fluid that was coming out.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's no
image on the Sudarium cloth.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But this
individual, call him Jesus,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.206 align:middle line:84%
was in excruciating
pain, must have been.

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: There's
no doubt about it.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Tortured.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.981 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Tortured horribly.

00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:26.607 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:28.939 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So he would have
been beaten severely about

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:90%
the face and shoulders.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.972 align:middle line:84%
And the scourge marks, which
you'll see, about 120 of them

00:11:33.972 --> 00:11:34.555 align:middle line:90%
on the Shroud.

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:35.465 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So he
was really tortured.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And whether you're a Christian,
a Jew, or don't care at all,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how somebody
could look at that image

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and see what was
done to this man

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and not feel some empathy
just as a human being for what

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:90%
this man suffered.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Whoever
he might have been.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.066 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Whoever he was.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
He really suffered.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, people
often say to me, well,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:90%
how do you know it's Jesus?

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.527 align:middle line:84%
We don't have his fingerprints,
his DNA, and his mug shot.

00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yet.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Although even if
we did, I'd be very hesitant--

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I would expect many people
would deny it anyway.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:90%
But how do we know it's Jesus?

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Romans
crucified a lot of people.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:90%
They speared a lot of people.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:90%
They scourged a lot of people.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But to our knowledge
there's only one man,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
a man who proclaimed himself
the King of the Jews,

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and so to humiliate him
they gave him a crown.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.925 align:middle line:84%
They took a nasty thorn
bush and smacked it--

00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Jammed
it into his head.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.878 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: --onto his head.

00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Now some people say, well,
in the artworks it always

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
shows a beautiful
woven thorn crown.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Baloney.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Can you imagine
telling a Roman soldier,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you're about to execute this
guy, but before you do that,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
take some thorns and
make a pretty crown?

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.337 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's artistic
license, George.

00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm sure the person
who made the crown cut his

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.266 align:middle line:84%
hands trying to
put that together.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I'm sure that
whoever the poor Roman soldier

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
was given that task grabbed a
bush and just smashed it onto

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
his head.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just
wheeled it around.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And we have
blood stains all over this

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:90%
man's head.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going
to talk more about that.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Barrie Schwortz

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
here as we talk about
the Shroud of Turin.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:90%
An incredible story.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Was it indeed the
image of Jesus when

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
he was crucified
a long time ago?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
the possibility of the DNA

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
testing, the carbon dating, and
what it all meant, but let's

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
take some of your
questions for Barrie.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.089 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.707 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:13:20.707 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: When you were
taking the photographs,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
did you have any problems
with your equipment batteries

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:84%
running down quickly or anything
like that that some people

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
experienced in
similar situations?

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: When we
made the photographs,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:84%
the time that I was given
to make the photographs,

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
which was several different
times within the five days

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and nights that we examined
the cloth-- and of course,

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
during the examination
by other scientists,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I was documenting their work--
I never had any problems.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.715 align:middle line:90%
But then I was well-planned.

00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I was a professional.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I had plenty of spare batteries.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I wore kind of a
fisherman's vest,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and there were pockets
full of film and batteries

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and whatever other accessories
that typical photographers

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.256 align:middle line:90%
might use.

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I was well-equipped.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Lenses, I had several
lenses in my pockets.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
So I was well-covered.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.155 align:middle line:84%
But again, we spent almost
two years planning the event.

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.655 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
five days and nights

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:90%
to actually perform those tests.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But nothing extraordinary
happened equipment-wise,

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and the resulting photographs
are a testament to that.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But whatever
created that image,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
whether it's was a painting--
and I have my doubts--

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
or a burst of
energy from a body,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that moment must have been
literally electrifying.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, because
there's no witnesses

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to the event that occurred in
the tomb, there's speculation.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
wrote about light.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.565 align:middle line:84%
People have written that perhaps
it was some form of radiation.

00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
None of those have
proven to be viable

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
based on the physical
and chemical properties

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:90%
of the image itself.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And remembering that our
team, which was there

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to sort of test all of
the conventional theories

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Shroud, we prepared
by bringing with us

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the kind of equipment
that would be

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
used for authentication
of artwork.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.675 align:middle line:84%
Obviously conventional wisdom,
including my personal beliefs,

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get there,
see the paint, and be done.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.035 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Da Vinci
did it, right?

00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, I
don't know about that.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But the point is it might
be some form of artwork.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So we brought with
us the infrared

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.335 align:middle line:84%
and the ultraviolet
fluorescence photography.

00:15:20.335 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did you rule that out?

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.211 align:middle line:84%
Artwork has been ruled
out, because we did--

00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.335 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --mass
spectrometry,

00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
which was sensitive enough to
be able to detect parts per

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.269 align:middle line:84%
billion of any
paints or pigments.

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And we had spectral
data of every paint and pigment

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that had been used from
medieval to modern times.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You would have seen
any paintings on it, right?

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: We would have
seen it in the microscopy.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It would've been detected
by the spectral data.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:90%
We found no paints or pigments.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
There were a few particles
of red iron oxide, which,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
of course, has allowed
skeptics to attack it.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, red iron oxide's a pigment.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could they fake it
today with today's technology?

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: It's
interesting, a great question.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.769 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at probably every
attempt in the last 35 years

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to duplicate the
Shroud, many of them

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:90%
using my photographs as a basis.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
No one's even come close.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
still can't do it.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: There's not one
person that's matched any

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of the chemical or
physical properties.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to
make something that

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.495 align:middle line:84%
looks like the image
of the Shroud--

00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But when
you investigate it--

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --but when you
look at it more carefully,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the chemistry
and you look at the physics,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.909 align:middle line:84%
no one's even come
close, not even close.

00:16:23.909 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: God, that's exciting.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: It is.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because do
you know what it means?

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that too.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Barrie.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.256 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So you said
that you had tried to leave

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:37.989 align:middle line:84%
the program before, but you
were intrigued enough to stay.

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
What was it that intrigued you?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.321 align:middle line:84%
And what it did you find most
intriguing about the Shroud?

00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I can give you the
same answer to both of those

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
The image on this
piece of cloth is

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:84%
unlike any other
image I've seen.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as a
professional photographer

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.052 align:middle line:84%
charged with creating
images, and then

00:16:57.052 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
as a guy who's been involved
with the Shroud publicly

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
for so long, I've
looked at every effort

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that people have
made to duplicate it.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it
just boggles my mind

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that even using my high
resolution images, folks

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
who have tried to
duplicate it and say, look,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we made it look like the Shroud,
thus proving it's a fake,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as we examine
their result, comparing it

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
to the chemistry and physics
that we have documented

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:84%
on the Shroud, and
which is published

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:84%
in the peer-reviewed
scientific literature--

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
this isn't published in
magazines or commercial books

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:90%
or TV documentaries.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It's published in peer-reviewed
scientific journals,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
some of the highest
caliber journals-- no one

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.215 align:middle line:90%
has come close.

00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And frankly-- somebody
once said to me,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:90%
what if I gave you $1 million?

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.068 align:middle line:90%
Could you duplicate it?

00:17:44.068 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, push the
money right back.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Because after all
these years of study,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm no closer to an explanation
of how this image could form

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
with these chemical
and physical properties

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
than I was the day
I first saw it.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Barrie, is there
any blood on the Shroud?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: There is a lot of
blood on the Shroud, George.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
prominent blood stains

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:90%
is the spear wound bloodstain.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the actually darkest
blood stain on the cloth.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
There are blood stains
covering the head.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
There are blood stains
at the arms or wrists.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But remember, we only
see the back of one.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It all
matches up, doesn't it?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: It does.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Gosh.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.911 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And as
a matter of fact,

00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:84%
something very unique about
the blood stain at the wrist.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Most artists have
always depicted

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus crucified
through the palms.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But forensically, that's not
a very good thing, especially

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:90%
for a strong man.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:90%
He could tear himself lose.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.022 align:middle line:90%
So they would--

00:18:38.022 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's really
right around here, right?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
If you put your thumb and
little finger together,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
it forms a groove called
the thenar furrow.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
thing for a Roman soldier

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to do that, stick a nail there,
drive it through at an angle,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and you would see
an exit wound right

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:90%
where we see it on the Shroud.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They couldn't
have done it here.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
That would have killed
him immediately, right?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, it
wouldn't have killed him,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
but it would have been a
probably more difficult place

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:90%
to drive through.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
In this fleshy part of
the palm-- and ironically,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:84%
the skeptics again say,
well, it says hand.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't say palm.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:90%
In Greek there's no difference.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The word for hand
means hand and palm.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'll tell you a great
story that matches up exactly

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.381 align:middle line:90%
with what you were just saying.

00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
When I was producing
a television show back

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in Detroit, I'm 26 years
old, and we had scripts.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:90%
We had scripts like this.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:90%
They were all piled up.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.304 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of a newscast,
we had a paper spindle, right?

00:19:25.304 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
You know what that is?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
little spike thing.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So I did this, and you would
do that after every show.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning the
next guy would get it,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
read the scripts that you used
during newscast at the night.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.739 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did that and missed.

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Uh-oh.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: My hand went
right through the spindle.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel it at all.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.682 align:middle line:84%
My director looked at me
and went, oh my god, George.

00:19:46.682 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: You're bleeding.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This thing is
sticking right through here.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:90%
He pulled it right out.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Not one piece of blood came out.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But there was a hole there,
and it was right in there.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, the spindle
that probably impaled you would

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:84%
have been probably thinner and
perhaps more sharp than a Roman

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.592 align:middle line:84%
crucifixion nail, which are
little rough and coarse.

00:20:07.592 --> 00:20:08.425 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And rusty.

00:20:08.425 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: And rusty.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And they get wider as they
go up toward the head.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Made out
of iron or wood?

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.571 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Made out
of iron, most likely.

00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it would have left
a bit more of a hole.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And we do see a blood
stain, but we see it

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the wrist,
which is forensically correct,

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:84%
unlike all of the
artworks that are

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
typical of depicting the
crucifixion of Jesus, which

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
typically show it
through the palm.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to note
that contemporary artists who

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
have learned about the Shroud
are now showing the nail

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
wound a little closer to the
wrist, which is accurately

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
depicted on the Shroud as well.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think the Shroud is
having some influence on more

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%
modern artists.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can we do a
DNA study on the blood?

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.565 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Interestingly
enough, in 1995, George,

00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:90%
a DNA study was done.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It was done by two scientists at
the University of Texas Health

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.985 align:middle line:90%
Science Center in San Antonio.

00:20:57.985 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We've got
better technology now.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.381 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: We have
better technology now.

00:21:01.381 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
But they did a DNA analysis.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
They were able to determine
that the blood on the shroud

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:90%
is male, human, normal DNA.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was very old
and very degraded,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.939 align:middle line:84%
so there wouldn't be enough
there to create a full profile.

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And when
people bring up DNA,

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I always remind them DNA
analysis is a comparative

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:90%
analysis.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:90%
You find a sample.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:90%
You get a profile.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:90%
You get the bad guy.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:90%
You take his DNA.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:90%
If they match, that's your man.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
a complete DNA profile

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:84%
based on the age of the sample
or the conditions under which

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
stored, there's

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
not a lot more they
can do with it.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so my answer
is even if we had

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
a full profile of the Man of the
Shroud, which we probably never

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:84%
could because it's so old, who
are we going to compare it to?

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So it really becomes a
real kind of a moot point.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:90%
But DNA is a buzz word.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We've all seen the TV
shows and everything,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're much more aware of it
and aware of how important it

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:90%
is in the forensic sciences.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the question
comes up often, well,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
can they clone something
from the Shroud?

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
some movies and TV

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
shows that have been
based on that, some books.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't clone something
without, again, a complete DNA

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.435 align:middle line:90%
profile.

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So no, we're not going to clone
the Antichrist from the Shroud.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Even if you clone
Jesus, even if you cloned him,

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.984 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't have his soul.

00:22:22.984 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, and
that's the other thing.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't from a
philosophical point of view

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
have any strong feelings one
way or the other about cloning.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's
used in many places

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:90%
where it's a beneficial thing.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more
wild-eyed theories of,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
like I said, cloning the
Antichrist from the blood

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
of the Shroud is sort
of silly and, obviously,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
is not going to happen,
and it isn't possible.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:90%
But I believe this.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Considering that the Shroud
of Turin has become the most

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
studied artifact in modern
human history with more science

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
applied to it than any
other artifact of the Church

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
or of Christianity in general,
and we still cannot provide

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
a means to make an image with
these exact same properties,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
pretty convincing evidence to
me that this is not a fake.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It only took me 18
years after holding it

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
in my hand to be fully
convinced, so I didn't rush.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you went in
thinking it wasn't real.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I went in thinking
not only it wasn't real,

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I was going to see the paint
and go, oh, time to go home.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Got you.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Done.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about the date?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's been carbon
dated a couple times.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.149 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's a
whole other story, George.

00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
The carbon dating
was done in 1988.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They took a little
piece from one corner.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
They cut that in half.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was this
before or after the fire?

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:90%
There was a fire, right?

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: There
was a fire in 1997.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.402 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:23:43.402 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And there was
a fire in 1532, of course,

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that was responsible for all the
burns and scorches that we see.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: There may have
been something in between,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
but nothing that put the Shroud
at great risk the way those

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So they take this
one little sample

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:90%
from this one little corner.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And from that one sample--
they cut it in half

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
then take half of it
and cut it in thirds,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
give each to the three
different radiocarbon labs.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate in
August of last year

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to go to the Arizona laboratory
and photograph the remaining

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
samples that they still
have left from the Shroud,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and we've posted
that on our site.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:90%
People can find that.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Shroud.com

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Shroud.com.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We'll talk about that.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.651 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Right.

00:24:19.651 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so as far as the
carbon dating goes,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:90%
the results came out.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.355 align:middle line:90%
The Shroud is medieval.

00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It must be a hoax.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
one of the scientists

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
who did the dating said that
anybody who still believes

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.295 align:middle line:84%
the Shroud's authentic should
belong to the Flat Earth

00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:33.795 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, no.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So
for about 20 years,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.158 align:middle line:84%
I was a member of the Flat
Earth Society, apparently.

00:24:38.158 --> 00:24:38.954 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:24:38.954 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
didn't even know it.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, I didn't
know it because here's why.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
There is strong scientific
and historic evidence

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
that says the Shroud is older.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with that
because of my studies

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and my examination of it.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very
comfortable knowing

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that there had to be something
wrong with the carbon dating.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:90%
But look, I'm not a physicist.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to be smarter
than the guys who did this work.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
questionable about it,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
which it took about 12 years
before new science was done

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.151 align:middle line:84%
that came to light that
showed us what was wrong.

00:25:13.151 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened?

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: What happened?

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
They took one little sample
from one little corner.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.645 align:middle line:84%
They took no other samples from
anywhere else on the Shroud.

00:25:20.645 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they
couldn't come up with--

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So there's
no point of comparison.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --the variety.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.684 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They couldn't tell
if what they were testing there

00:25:26.684 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
was the same as what
was at the other corner.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And so they did this test.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They released the results
with huge fanfare.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.629 align:middle line:90%
It was media frenzy worldwide.

00:25:34.629 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was on
top of that story.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Shroud is a fake.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Shroud is a fake.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who understood
and knew about all the science

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:84%
were bothered, mainly not
by what the findings were

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but by the way it was portrayed
and by the fact that all

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
the other evidence
was tossed out.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Normally in the real
scientific community,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
you ask any archaeologist,
physicist, you do 100 tests.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.864 align:middle line:90%
99 point in one direction.

00:25:56.864 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:84%
One points the
opposite direction.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called an outlier.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
What do they do with that?

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.879 align:middle line:90%
They discard it.

00:26:01.879 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the Shroud,
they did the opposite.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
They kept the one test
that said it was a fake,

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:90%
and all the other tests--

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Discarded that.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --they just threw
it away as if it didn't count

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this
isn't just stuff

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
published in personal
journals or websites or blogs.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.061 align:middle line:84%
This is published in
peer-reviewed scientific

00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:90%
journals.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So how old do we
think the Shroud is now?

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, I think
the Shroud is old enough to be

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:90%
the cloth that wrapped Jesus.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.116 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
problem accepting that.

00:26:27.116 --> 00:26:29.161 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Has science
backed that up?

00:26:29.161 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Science, aside
from that one radiocarbon dating

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:90%
test, generally does, yes.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It does.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.191 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Now I want to
quickly share a quick story.

00:26:36.191 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
My 89-year-old Jewish mother
heard one of my lectures

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in person
about eight years ago.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
We were driving back at
the end of the lecture,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and she was very quiet.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And a quiet Jewish
mother is very scary.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.872 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:26:48.872 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So we're
sitting there in the car.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I finally turned
to her, and I said, OK,

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
mother, what do you think?

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm curious what a
little Jewish lady, immigrant

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
from Poland, came through
Ellis Island at age seven,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
what she thought of all this.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me in typical
Jewish mother style and says,

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.139 align:middle line:84%
Barrie, they wouldn't have
kept it for 2,000 years

00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:90%
if it belonged to anybody else.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't matter.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.212 align:middle line:84%
So I thought how cute
and clever that was.

00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:12.795 align:middle line:84%
But the more I thought
of it, the more

00:27:12.795 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I realized what a real profound
observation that really is.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have this
piece of cloth?

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Burial cloths typically
going in the grave.

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:90%
They decay with the body.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
They're organic,
the body's organic,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and so we might find little
bits and pieces of and remnants.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet this burial shroud, which
is obviously a burial shroud,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
was separated from the body
before any liquefaction,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
within 36 or so hours,
before any oozing of decay

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:90%
came out of the body.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does that
happen when you die?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.908 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: It does
happen when you die.

00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But depending on the
humidity, the temperature,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
the conditions, it
could take anywhere

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.689 align:middle line:84%
from just 20 hours, 24
hours, up to 48 hours.

00:27:48.689 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: But generally
you start to get--

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it does happen.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.425 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
smell pretty bad.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.863 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:27:53.863 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So I think that
my mother's great observation

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
there is sort of
right on the money.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Why would they have
bothered to keep this?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.369 align:middle line:84%
If it belonged to
somebody unimportant,

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:90%
they would have thrown it away.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have
mattered to anyone.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet what we have here is
an authentic first century

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Jewish burial shroud.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
If you use the ancient
method of measurement,

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
it's four cubits by
one cubit precisely.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, let's look at
the comparisons to the Bible--

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --and see what they
said about the crucifixion.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.843 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:28:21.843 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Thorns in the head.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Absolutely.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does the
Shroud show that?

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Absolutely.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The spike
marks in the hands.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: We talked
about that, yes.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:84%
We only can see the
back of one, but we

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.297 align:middle line:84%
know he was
crucified, absolutely.

00:28:31.297 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The wound on the side.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.838 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: The spear wound
on the side, absolutely.

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about
the spike in the feet?

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Absolutely.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.118 align:middle line:84%
There are blood
stains on the feet.

00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We can only see the
back of one heel

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and the flat of the other
foot, both covered with blood.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot tell if there was
a single or two nails used.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.845 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that
it was a single nail,

00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:52.829 align:middle line:84%
and many artists have depicted
one foot over the other.

00:28:52.829 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.828 align:middle line:84%
If I were on the
cross and somebody

00:28:54.828 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:84%
were trying to nail my feet
to it and I had one foot free,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd be kicking that guy.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So everything on the
Shroud that could be authentic

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.220 align:middle line:84%
in terms of time-- let's not
even talk about who was in that

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
shroud, who was covered by it--
matches up with the description

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
in the New Testament.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.646 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And we haven't even
mentioned the 120 scourge marks

00:29:12.646 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that cover this man's body
with dumbbell-shaped bruises,

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
many of them tore the flesh,
made by a Roman flagrum,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.432 align:middle line:84%
a known weapon, a whip used
by the Romans for torture.

00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So everything
matches, everything.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The face on the
Shroud, it's a negative, right?

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.336 align:middle line:90%
It's got a reverse negative?

00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what I always heard.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.501 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I hear that.

00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
a confusing thing,

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:90%
being a photographer of course.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe the easiest way to
say it is that the Shroud has

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
one property very much like
a photographic negative,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the lights
and the darks of the image

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
are reversed from what
we're used to seeing.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:84%
We're used to seeing light
highlights, dark shadows.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the Shroud,
the lights and darks,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the way we would normally
expect to see, are reversed.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a
photograph of the Shroud

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
negative, suddenly it

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
takes on a much more natural and
pleasing form with the lights

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.204 align:middle line:84%
and darks back to
what we would perceive

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
like a black and
white photograph.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.362 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If the
Shroud is authentic,

00:30:10.362 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:90%
and you believe it is--

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.528 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I believe it is.

00:30:12.528 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --tell me
scientifically how it would

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:90%
have been created.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Explain the science behind it.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.478 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well,
I will say this,

00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that our team went to Turin
primarily to answer a single

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.764 align:middle line:90%
How is the image formed?

00:30:28.764 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.721 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And of course,
the conventional wisdom was

00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
painting, photography,
scorching of some form, artwork.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we took all the
tests to examine that.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:90%
We examined all that.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We eliminated all
those as possibilities.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And so our goal, which was to
answer the single question how

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
was the image formed, we
were unable to answer.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We could tell you what it's
not, not a painting, not

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:84%
a photograph, not
a scorch, and we

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
did all the tests
that proved that.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which all the
skeptics claimed it was.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They still do to
this day, some of them, George.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have published
science, incredible scientific

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:84%
literature that shows
it's none of those.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet we could not come
up with a single mechanism

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of any sort, especially a
naturally occurring mechanism,

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that could account
for the physical

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and chemical properties
of the image.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.242 align:middle line:84%
That being said, there
was a theory by one

00:31:15.242 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of the chemists
who was on our team

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
from Los Alamos National
Laboratory, 35 years

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:84%
emeritus from Los Alamos,
Ray Rogers, passed away now.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Rogers, being a
chemist, wanted to see

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.120 align:middle line:84%
if he could find some chemical
method that might explain it.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.759 align:middle line:84%
The way the ancient
cloth was made,

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
after it was woven together
it was kind of stiff.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
They would soak it in a
naturally occurring detergent

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
or softener called
saponaria, soap weed.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was known by
first century time.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.812 align:middle line:90%
They could soften the cloth up.

00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:51.770 align:middle line:84%
They would then rinse it
and dry it in the air,

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:84%
meaning it dried by
evaporation, leaving

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
a residue of this saponaria on
the top surface of the fibers.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.389 align:middle line:84%
Well, that happens to
be a pentose sugar.

00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
into too much chemistry

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's not my
field, but it's a sugar.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So Rogers was saying, OK,
we found this on the cloth.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
What would cause the
discoloration of that?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And he found that--

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Besides aging?

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Besides
aging itself,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
he found that the amines, the
ammonia gas and other gases

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.840 align:middle line:84%
called heavier amines,
putrescine, cadaverine--

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That came
out of the body.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.468 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --that
come out of the body.

00:32:22.468 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Would create a chemical
reaction with this pentose sugar

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the fibers, which

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:84%
is where the image resides,
doesn't penetrate in

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:90%
like paint would.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
He felt and he demonstrated
with experiments

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that you could
discolor and kind of

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
cause a yellowing, a slight
browning of that sugar,

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:90%
causing the image.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And it would also account
for that correlation

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:90%
of image density to distance.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the farther
away the body

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
was from the cloth,
the less of that--

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.151 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You have.

00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --escaping
gases would be.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Now that theory is not well
accepted by many people,

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.470 align:middle line:84%
in part, I believe,
because many people don't

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.710 align:middle line:90%
feel that's miraculous enough.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Somebody once wrote me
and said, why would God

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
use such a simple mundane
method to make an image?

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.700 align:middle line:90%
And my answer is I don't know.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Ask God.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ask God.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Because
I have no idea.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.209 align:middle line:84%
And if God is truly God, he
can do whatever he wants.

00:33:17.209 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Here's my theory, and
you tell me how far off I am.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: OK.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: We're all energy.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: OK.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All of us--

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I agree.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --are about
14 billion years old.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.601 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's true.

00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The energy that we
have in our bodies is the same

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.140 align:middle line:84%
energy that was around when
the universe was formed.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's true.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.825 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's just molded.

00:33:33.825 --> 00:33:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It's turned into who we
are and everything else,

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's still 14
billion years old.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember "Star Trek"
when they were beamed aboard?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:84%
They would get into
this little teleporter,

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and down to some
planet they would go.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But they would kind of like
twinkle, and they'd be gone.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's true.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because there was
no body, we don't think,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
my theory is-- now think of
all the things I just said--

00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --is that after they
covered the body up, Jesus,

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
who truly was part of this
divine creation, as we all are,

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.996 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
literally disintegrate.

00:34:14.996 --> 00:34:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Dematerialize.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Dematerialize.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
And that process
created the energy

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that beamed that
image on the Shroud.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.866 align:middle line:84%
And so the body was gone,
but the image of that--

00:34:27.866 --> 00:34:29.949 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Remained on
the surface of the cloth.

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --remained on it.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That is actually
one of the theories of one

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
of the members of our team
who believes there was

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:90%
a dematerialization of the body.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So that is a theory that
I've heard proposed before.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The only problem with
that is it steps out

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.975 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of known science
into an area of speculation.

00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:50.059 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But things happen
without known science.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I absolutely
agree with that.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.995 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take
it a step further.

00:34:52.995 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is preposterous.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: OK.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What if Jesus-- and
this is not negating my belief

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:90%
in God by any means--

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.913 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I understand.

00:35:01.913 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What if Jesus
was an extraterrestrial,

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:84%
came to this planet
to teach human beings,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and they beamed him back?

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.540 align:middle line:90%
They just took the body back up.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, that's
an interesting theory.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's another theory.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I have no
way to challenge that,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
nor would I want to.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Technologically,
they'd have the capability

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.664 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I would assume
that would be the case.

00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But remembering that I was
a member of the only really

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:84%
scientific team ever
to examine this cloth,

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and now that many of
them have passed on,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.972 align:middle line:90%
I'm sort of the last guy--

00:35:33.972 --> 00:35:34.805 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're it.

00:35:34.805 --> 00:35:36.763 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I'm one of
the last ones standing,

00:35:36.763 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that I am obligated,
because what I learned from

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.020 align:middle line:84%
them about science and
empiricism and honesty

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and integrity, I am compelled
to stay within the realm of--

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What you know.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --natural sciences,
because that was our goal.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
That was what our
team was there to do.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, do I eliminate the
supernatural possibilities?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.874 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:35:57.874 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Because you can't.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.706 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: No.

00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And when questions come
to me-- and people always

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
send me things, look what we saw
in the Shroud-- I always say,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
well, look, I can give
you one of two answers.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you want the scientific
answer or the other one?

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And they always say, well, start
with the scientific answer.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, there's no
scientific explanation that

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.620 align:middle line:84%
can account for what
you just described.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I say, but the other
explanation is this.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't speak for God.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And God can do
whatever he wants.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you have seen something
on that cloth that has moved you

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.150 align:middle line:84%
in some way, who am I to
say that you're wrong?

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I cannot see through
someone else's eyes.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it would be inappropriate
and, I think, ignorant of me

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:90%
to challenge people.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'd be arguing with
people every minute of my life.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.042 align:middle line:84%
So it's much easier
to understand

00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that there's a scientific
explanation-- we can answer

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:84%
certain questions--
and then there's

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:84%
a more spiritual,
religious, if you will,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:84%
aspect of it, which this cloth
is very significant to about

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.770 align:middle line:90%
a billion people on this planet.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I am not going
to step on their toes

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and challenge them in an area
that's, A, I'm not a Christian.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I cannot challenge Christianity
or, for that matter,

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
even Judaism.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you can tell
them it's not a painting.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I can say
it's not a painting,

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.605 align:middle line:84%
it's not a photograph,
and it's not a scorch.

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've proven
that, which is not

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:90%
a word you'll hear me use often.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Ray Rogers used to call
me up and yell at me when

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
he saw that I wrote
proven on the website.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.632 align:middle line:84%
He says, it takes an
awful lot of evidence

00:37:22.632 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:90%
to consider something proven.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.548 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough
to call that proven.

00:37:25.548 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Take that down.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.742 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If it's
not a painting,

00:37:28.742 --> 00:37:31.592 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't created by
mankind, like da Vinci--

00:37:31.592 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Not by the hand.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not by the hand.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.609 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is it?

00:37:35.609 --> 00:37:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's a question
I've been asking for 35 years,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still not much
closer to an answer.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're baffled.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I'm baffled,
as is most science.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.414 align:middle line:84%
Now look, people of
faith look at this

00:37:45.414 --> 00:37:47.580 align:middle line:84%
from a completely different
point of view than I do.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They have
their answer right there.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They
have an answer.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They say, it's proof
of the Resurrection.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:90%
So people ask me that question.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Does this prove
the Resurrection?

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, if in the Gospels they
had described the Resurrection

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.742 align:middle line:84%
event in some form, then
perhaps we could say, oh, yeah,

00:38:01.742 --> 00:38:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that matches up with
the Gospel accounts,

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.040 align:middle line:84%
because the rest of it
matches pretty well.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, it's
pretty darn close.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, but
nobody witnessed the event.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, nobody did.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And my
answer is always, look,

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.020 align:middle line:84%
if we could go into the
laboratory and resurrect

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:84%
people, we could see what
kind of images we get.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But the apostles
who saw the body of Christ

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.084 align:middle line:90%
afterward standing with them--

00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: They did.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --before he
resurrected and ascended saw

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:90%
a body--

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.966 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: They did.

00:38:23.966 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --that
somehow rematerialized,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.100 align:middle line:90%
if you believe those accounts.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And look, I
certainly wouldn't challenge

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, from
my point of view,

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:84%
being a photographer dealing
with tangible materials,

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:84%
if we could resurrect
people as something

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that was part of
our science, then we

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:84%
could see what
impacts it would be.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we would
find, yes, that makes

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:90%
exactly an image like this.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But the
bottom line is,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:84%
ruling out a hand painting
and all these other things,

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.941 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what it is.

00:38:52.941 --> 00:38:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I can
tell you what it's not,

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:90%
but I can't tell you what it is.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that alone
is a great mystery.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: It certainly is.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to take
some questions for Barrie

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Schwortz here while we
have some time left.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: In Tibet there's
been documented evidence

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of high lamas attaining what
they call the luminous rainbow

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
There's that, where when
they die all that's left

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:90%
is hair and fingernails.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
There's another
piece of that, which

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is called the great transfer
where they completely dissolve

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.577 align:middle line:84%
into light, and this has been
witnessed and documented.

00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I haven't really--
I perhaps vaguely have heard

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
about it but never
very specifically,

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
so I really don't have
much information about it.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But look, I've been
doing this long enough

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to learn never to speak
in absolute terms.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But done by human
beings who might have had

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:84%
the same techniques
that Jesus had.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Perhaps.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I've met people
who have witnessed it.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And I certainly
don't challenge those things,

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
because I've learned-- one of
the things about getting older

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is you come to realize
just how smart you're not.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I've come to understand
that, although I may have

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.820 align:middle line:84%
my point of view from a direct
examination and the science

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that we did, there's so much
beyond that that I don't know

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and that I don't understand,
I would be a real fool

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to get up and publicly
challenge things

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:90%
that I don't understand myself.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So I accept that all of these
are other possibilities.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always stuck back with
that sort of tangible science,

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
we did, and that's

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
how I examined that cloth.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, I had my face
this close to it, thus leaving--

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.145 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You wanted to
prove it was painted.

00:40:35.145 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah, I pretty
much did, yeah, George.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you
couldn't do it.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Not
only couldn't I do.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.362 align:middle line:84%
I eventually became
convinced just the opposite.

00:40:42.362 --> 00:40:44.195 align:middle line:84%
And of course, by
breathing on it like that,

00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I left my DNA on it too.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
with DNA analysis

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.730 align:middle line:90%
on the Shroud, contamination.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's been kissed and loved
and hugged and breathed on

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and touched by thousands of
people through its history.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.940 align:middle line:84%
How do you know whose DNA
you're actually testing?

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So one day they'll test
it 2,000 years from now,

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and some guy will say, no,
no, that was Barrie Schwortz.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That was an
old hippie Jewish guy from

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Colorado.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's who it was.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.845 align:middle line:90%
Put your hands over like that.

00:41:07.845 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: There you go.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: See, you never know.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.375 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I match right up.

00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about another
question for Barrie?

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:12.897 align:middle line:90%
Right behind you.

00:41:12.897 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: What is
the Shroud made out of?

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And how has it been
preserved for 2,000 years

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.952 align:middle line:84%
without modern
preservation methods?

00:41:20.952 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yes.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:84%
The Shroud is made of pure woven
linen, which, interestingly

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.350 align:middle line:84%
enough, is specified
in the Old Testament

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and is a requirement
for a Jewish burial

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
cloth, particularly of
someone of higher stature.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
The Gospels tell
us it was provided

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.130 align:middle line:84%
by Joseph of Arimathea,
a wealthy man.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tell us much else
about Joseph but the fact

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that they say he
was a wealthy man.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:84%
This kind of herringbone weave
would have been manufactured.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And probably the nearest
place would have been Syria.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it would have had to come
on a caravan on a camel's back.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It would have been imported
thus into Jerusalem

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and would have been an
expensive piece of cloth.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
Jewish law forbids

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
the mixing of the
kinds, they call it.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the mixing of
cotton or wool with linen.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And people of high
stature, the pharisees,

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:84%
someone of that
caliber, would have

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:84%
been buried in a
pure linen shroud.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's specified
in the Torah.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So the Shroud meets
those requirements.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, it's a four cubit

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:84%
by one cubit, exactly
the unit of measure

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:90%
used in that period of time.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If this
was indeed authentic,

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
everything has been preordained,
why leave it behind?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:90%
A record for us?

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, you know,
there's a great question

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.030 align:middle line:84%
George, because it's
one of the questions,

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.805 align:middle line:84%
especially when I addressed
Christian audiences--

00:42:46.805 --> 00:42:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an answer
to the question,

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:84%
so I generally pose
to the audience,

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
why do you think that
this was left behind,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
remembering that many of the
facets of what we've learned

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:84%
of this shroud couldn't
have even been learned until

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:90%
the 20th century?

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a calling card.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: It seems
to be something.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And the way I see it is this.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Anything that makes
us consider our faith,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:84%
our spirituality,
God, is a good thing.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.145 align:middle line:84%
In the modern age that we live
in, there's so little of that

00:43:14.145 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that I see the Shroud
as something that,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.895 align:middle line:90%
perhaps as a guidepost.

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And I always point
out to people, look,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the Shroud didn't come with
a book of instructions,

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and the answer is not going
to be on a piece of cloth--

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.426 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, it's
not that easy.

00:43:24.426 --> 00:43:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --but in the eye
and the heart of those who look

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:90%
upon it.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps it's something
there to either strengthen

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.840 align:middle line:84%
people's faith or
restore their faith

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:84%
or even just make them
consider their faith.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And anything that does that is
good in my book, so I see it

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:90%
has great value.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.045 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about another
question for Barrie?

00:43:41.045 --> 00:43:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: One more here.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.824 align:middle line:90%
There you go, right up front.

00:43:45.824 --> 00:43:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
After you had discovered that
this was in fact authentic,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.020 align:middle line:84%
how did that challenge
your own beliefs?

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.294 align:middle line:90%
Did anything shift in your own--

00:43:58.294 --> 00:43:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Great question.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
break down and cry?

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, basically
what happened was by the time I

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:84%
was convinced it was
authentic it was 1995,

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and I built shroud.com in 1996.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I sort
of went public with it,

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.070 align:middle line:84%
people started to asking
me a new question, what

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:15.694 align:middle line:90%
do you believe?

00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:17.950 align:middle line:84%
The same basic question
you just asked.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mentioned
earlier I was raised

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:84%
in a very orthodox Jewish
home, "Fiddler on the Roof,"

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.064 align:middle line:84%
God part of
everything every day.

00:44:24.064 --> 00:44:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Zero Mostel.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah,
Zero Mostel, exactly.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But I walked away from that at
age 13 after my bar mitzvah.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:90%
I felt it was hypocritical.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in it.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And I never looked back.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.206 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm 50
years old in 1996,

00:44:38.206 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
people want to know

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
what I believe about this
and what my faith is,

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and I hadn't considered
that since I was a kid.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm forced at age
50 to confront my faith

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.020 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
honestly as an adult.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked inside,
I found that, yeah, God

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:84%
had been there all along just
waiting for me to acknowledge.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.436 align:middle line:84%
And so how many Jews can say
it was the Shroud of Turin that

00:45:01.436 --> 00:45:02.935 align:middle line:84%
led them back to
their faith in God?

00:45:02.935 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And yet
that's what happened to me.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, many
people want to know,

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.850 align:middle line:84%
are you a Christian
or Messianic Jew?

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.424 align:middle line:90%
And my answer is no.

00:45:11.424 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
very disappointing

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.570 align:middle line:90%
to certain audiences.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, look, I
didn't choose this job.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I would never have chosen to
do this on my own volition.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously there was
a hand guiding me

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.020 align:middle line:90%
that led me to this place.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's good enough for
God to have a Jew represent

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the Shroud, it should be
good enough for everyone.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:33.050 align:middle line:84%
The other point is this,
because I know Christian dogma.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I always remind them,
relax, I'm not dead yet.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I
would be here today.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
I'll be tomorrow.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.211 align:middle line:84%
So for those who are
worried about my faith

00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and my salvation,
I always tell them

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:47.170 align:middle line:84%
relax, because I don't know
where I'll be tomorrow.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm called
upon and I feel

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.220 align:middle line:84%
moved to a point where I have
to make a decision like that,

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:90%
then I will.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But as it stands now,
I'm very happy to be

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:84%
that old Jewish hippie
guy who goes out and tells

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:90%
the truth about the Shroud.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's an important word.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.690 align:middle line:90%
My job is easy.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.064 align:middle line:84%
I was only asked to do one
thing, go out and be honest.

00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
that's what you did.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.104 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: If I had to go out
and make up stories to convince

00:46:10.104 --> 00:46:12.620 align:middle line:84%
people the Shroud was authentic,
I would fail miserably.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a gentleman come up to
me after one of my lectures,

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well, that
was a great lecture,

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.928 align:middle line:90%
but you'll never convince me.

00:46:18.928 --> 00:46:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what makes you
think I care what you believe?

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And he was shocked.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.789 align:middle line:90%
His eyes and his mouth got wide.

00:46:23.789 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, listen, that's
between you and God.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Take it up with him.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, shroud.com.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.061 align:middle line:84%

back and show you

00:46:29.061 --> 00:46:31.439 align:middle line:84%

00:46:35.774 --> 00:46:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm here with Barrie Schwortz.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:84%
He is talking about
the Shroud of Turin.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.946 align:middle line:84%
And this, Barrie, is an
authentic-sized replica--

00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Correct.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --of the
Shroud of Turin.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.593 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: This is a life-size
replica made from my original

00:46:49.593 --> 00:46:52.430 align:middle line:90%
photographs, taken in 1978.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was done with
large format four inch

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.290 align:middle line:84%
by five inch film, two
separate photographs that

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:84%
have been put together
now digitally,

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to create one giant life-size
replica of the cloth.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell us,
what are we looking at?

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:90%
What are these marks right here?

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.499 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:47:07.499 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The Shroud by itself
is very confusing,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.420 align:middle line:84%
because the really
important stuff

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.340 align:middle line:84%
is between these two
very distinctive scorches

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and burn marks that run the
entire length of the cloth.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So what you're looking at here
that runs along this border

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and again up above, those
are scorches and burns

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.867 align:middle line:90%
from a fire in 1532.

00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.015 align:middle line:84%
So they almost lost
the entire Shroud.

00:47:29.015 --> 00:47:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Almost
destroyed, exactly.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But ironically, notice that
the image which is between

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.920 align:middle line:90%
was barely touched at all.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the Poor Clare nuns in
1534 sewed in these patches

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.856 align:middle line:84%
you can see
throughout the cloth.

00:47:40.856 --> 00:47:42.896 align:middle line:84%
And when you get close,
you can see the stitching

00:47:42.896 --> 00:47:43.670 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:84%
In 2002 those
patches were removed.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't look quite
the same as this anymore.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:84%
In place of these, they put
a whiter cloth behind it,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:90%
so it's a little more stark now.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: For a moment I thought
an owl was buried there too.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I've had people
write to me and say, well,

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.530 align:middle line:90%
look there's a face.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.375 align:middle line:84%
Look at the eyes and
the nose and the mouth.

00:48:03.375 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's an eagle.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.380 align:middle line:90%
It's an Indian.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And people find what
they want to find.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Our brains do a lot of
filling in of blanks.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But what, of course,
is most important

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is the image of the man
which lived between these.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is
absolutely remarkable.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Right.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.138 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't know,
those of you in the audience,

00:48:19.138 --> 00:48:20.812 align:middle line:90%
if you can see this.

00:48:20.812 --> 00:48:22.297 align:middle line:90%
This is the head--

00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Correct

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --of whoever
was put in this shroud.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:31.510 align:middle line:84%
You can see the nose, the
eyebrows, or the marks

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.460 align:middle line:90%
from the thorns.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yes, the
blood stains here.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mustache or mouth?

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Correct.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And a beard.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.956 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Couple eyes.

00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:38.890 align:middle line:90%
The beard down here.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.974 align:middle line:90%
And explain the rest here.

00:48:39.974 --> 00:48:40.723 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Sure.

00:48:40.723 --> 00:48:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you move
further down, of course

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing some of
these diamond-shaped marks.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And these are water stains.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.244 align:middle line:84%
In 1532 when it
caught fire, they

00:48:48.244 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
dumped water on it
trying to put it out.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So it left water stains to
make it even more confusing.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.360 align:middle line:90%
By the way, this is a crease.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this
often under the chin.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply a creased
part of the cloth that

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:84%
used to be rolled
up all the time.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.260 align:middle line:90%
So it was very pressed in.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.690 align:middle line:90%
That's now been smoothed out.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But in 1978 when we made
the photographs, of course

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.027 align:middle line:90%
it was very prominent.

00:49:12.027 --> 00:49:13.360 align:middle line:90%
You can see some of the patches.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But right next to this patch,
you can see this oval shape.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the spear
wound in the side.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's the spear.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:19.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And you can see
the blood flow from that.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:84%
If you look closely, you can
notice that the blood is still

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
reddish in color,
which is not common.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Blood, old blood especially,
turns black or brown

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.890 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But the blood on the
Shroud remains red.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I mentioned earlier
that they treated this cloth

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.850 align:middle line:90%
with saponaria.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that saponaria

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on blood
keeping the blood red.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So the reason the blood is still
red on the Shroud most likely

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:47.827 align:middle line:84%
is the treatment the
cloth was given back then.

00:49:47.827 --> 00:49:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I can see
the crossed hands.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.201 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: You can
see the crossed hands.

00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:53.965 align:middle line:84%
You can see the blood stains
that ran down the arms.

00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: My, my, my.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: You can see the
back of this wrist and you can

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.480 align:middle line:90%
see the hands.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.027 align:middle line:84%
You can see that it's
approximately here.

00:50:00.027 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is a blood stain.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.474 align:middle line:84%
You can even see a
direction of blood flow.

00:50:03.474 --> 00:50:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to be careful--

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you all
make out that image?

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:90%
You see it?

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Can you see that?

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the closer you get
the more difficult it is.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we were examining the
Shroud in '78, there where many

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:84%
times where we
had to step back--

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.925 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
too close, yeah.

00:50:15.925 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --about
three yards or so.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.704 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How tall
was the individual?

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, again,
it's very difficult,

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.370 align:middle line:84%
because this is a substrate that
can change its physical shape

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.700 align:middle line:84%
based on the humidity
in which it's stored.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.639 align:middle line:90%
Approximately 5' 11".

00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That seems to be
a number that most people are

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.170 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Some have said, oh,
that's too tall.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Some have said, oh, no,
he was bigger than that.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.950 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard, remembering
that the image sort of gradually

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:41.460 align:middle line:90%
fades out.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So where do you exactly begin
and end your measurements?

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's an approximation.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The cloth can be
stretched, so that

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:84%
would change the
dimensions a little bit.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But 5'11" seems to be a number
most people are comfortable

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:55.120 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.020 align:middle line:84%
As we continue down below the
hands, you can see the feet.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You can see the blood stains at
the feet on the opposite side.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll go the other
side in a minute.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, very
confusing all these

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:84%
burns and scorches that
go the rest of the way.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, at the
other end we can see here-- now

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people see this
water stain and think

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.200 align:middle line:84%
it's the back of the
man's head and say,

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.117 align:middle line:84%
well, then he was only
a millimeter thin.

00:51:22.117 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That's just a water stain, and
the back of a head begins here.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From the fire.

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.820 align:middle line:90%
This is from that fire.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.886 align:middle line:84%
So the space
between the heads is

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:30.260 align:middle line:84%
appropriate for
the cloth the way

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
wrapped around body.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see many
more of the blood stains

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:84%
on the back of
the head, and this

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is what has been compared
with the Sudarium that's

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:90%
in Spain in Oviedo.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And many of these blood
stains are the same shape

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as the blood stains
on that other cloth.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.820 align:middle line:84%
That means there's a
possibility that they

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.510 align:middle line:90%
both wrapped the same man.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said to me, well,
they're two separate cloths,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and how come they're
not together?

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.870 align:middle line:84%
If they're not together,
they can't be authentic.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:58.661 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, they're
two separate cloths.

00:51:58.661 --> 00:52:00.880 align:middle line:90%
They can be separated, you know?

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It is physically
possible to move one

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.210 align:middle line:84%
in one direction and
one in the other.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
reasons the skeptics

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.827 align:middle line:84%
want to deny this
just boggle the mind.

00:52:09.827 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things you
can see very prominently

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:15.860 align:middle line:84%
on this side, these
are the scourge wounds.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.916 align:middle line:84%
And this was applied
with a Roman flagrum.

00:52:17.916 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
close to these, you'll

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.220 align:middle line:84%
see that there's like a
dark mark on either end sort

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of connected with a
little rod between.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
dumbbell-shaped weights

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.090 align:middle line:84%
on the end of a Roman flagrum
leave marks just like this.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Also, from the spear
wound on the side,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the blood ran around
to the back of the body

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and pulled at the
small of the back.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Now what artist is
even going to think--

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nobody
would think like that.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: --to do that?

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:48.282 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And the bottom line is
you had it checked to see if it

00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:48.990 align:middle line:90%
was done by hand.

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And no less
than three different forensic

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.900 align:middle line:84%
experts, including some
very well-noted ones,

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bucklin,
Frederick Zugibe,

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:84%
tens of thousands of
autopsies under their belt,

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.544 align:middle line:84%
they've looked at this as
if this was the crime scene.

00:53:04.544 --> 00:53:06.002 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there
any way, Barrie,

00:53:06.002 --> 00:53:09.470 align:middle line:84%
is there any way that
a human being who died,

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.250 align:middle line:84%
much like what was described
in the New Testament,

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.040 align:middle line:84%
without a Resurrection, could
the physical body create

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.767 align:middle line:84%
an image like this
on a linen naturally?

00:53:20.767 --> 00:53:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, it was the
theory I mentioned when we

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.560 align:middle line:84%
spoke earlier, that the
chemistry that Ray Rogers had

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.340 align:middle line:84%
predicted and did
some experiments with.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
could it make an image

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.050 align:middle line:84%
with the level of
resolution that we have?

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It would be a gas diffusion,
and it would have to be tight.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It would have to
be pretty tight.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.430 align:middle line:90%
So is it possible?

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure, it's possible.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:42.937 align:middle line:90%
Is it plausible?

00:53:42.937 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's more plausible than
some of the other theories that

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:90%
have been presented.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it an absolute
answer to this?

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.360 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we
have an answer yet.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it still does
not negate the possibility that

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.945 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was wrapped
in this shroud.

00:53:55.945 --> 00:53:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: As
a matter of fact,

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of any other
logical reason why somebody

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:02.530 align:middle line:84%
would keep a cloth that's so
blood-soaked against Jewish

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:90%
law.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.587 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you weren't supposed
to take this out of the tomb.

00:54:06.587 --> 00:54:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And people often
say, well, why wasn't

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:90%
this mentioned in the Gospels?

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.349 align:middle line:90%
Well, it broke Jewish law twice.

00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But again, mention the
things in the New Testament,

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and let's go through
each one, starting

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.250 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the head.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.911 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Top of the head,
blood stains from cap or crown

00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:20.410 align:middle line:90%
of thorns.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:22.045 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bang.

00:54:22.045 --> 00:54:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Come down here,
spear wound in the side with

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:84%
blood flow from the spear
wound, the darkest blood flow

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
on the Shroud.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Coming further down,
blood stains on the arms

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and at the back of the wrists
from the crucifixion nails.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.290 align:middle line:84%
At the feet, also
from the crucifixion--

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Matches perfectly.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.414 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And if you
look on the backside,

00:54:42.414 --> 00:54:44.930 align:middle line:84%
the dorsal view of the man,
you'll see that not only are

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:47.721 align:middle line:84%
there blood stains on his back,
but all the way down to his

00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:48.220 align:middle line:90%
ankles.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So when they whipped this man,
they whipped him mercilessly.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are these
all whip marks?

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That's correct,
all the way down to his ankles.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't just
hit him in the back.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He was hit--

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: --covered him.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --everywhere.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And
again, you can see--

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now was
that done, obviously,

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.124 align:middle line:84%
before they put him
up on the cross?

00:55:03.124 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: That was done
before he was put on the cross,

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.051 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:55:06.051 --> 00:55:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not afterward.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: After brought
off the cross, he was dead.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They put
the face cloth over him.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they didn't
beat him after he was dead.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.445 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah, they
took him to the tomb.

00:55:13.445 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
tortured him even more.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: They took
off the face cloth.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:16.510 align:middle line:90%
They wrapped him in this.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:18.176 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't time for
a complete burial.

00:55:18.176 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Look, if there had been time
for a complete anointing

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and preparation of the body,
we might not have any of this.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How much pain
did this man go through?

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.911 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: The pain this
man suffered would have been

00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:29.090 align:middle line:90%
excruciating.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I can't even fathom it.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any of us can
fathom, considering that they

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.360 align:middle line:84%
started beating him up the
night before in the Garden

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.590 align:middle line:90%
of Gethsemane.

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:38.740 align:middle line:90%
His face is bruised.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You can see one
cheekbone, both swollen,

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.570 align:middle line:90%
one swollen more than the other.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You can tell his face
had been severely beaten.

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.715 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see
these scourge marks

00:55:46.715 --> 00:55:48.489 align:middle line:90%
that cover his body.

00:55:48.489 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the crucifixion.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, he did not
survive that long on the cross.

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Unlike some crucifixion
victims that

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.450 align:middle line:84%
could be there for
many, many hours,

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.880 align:middle line:84%
he died rather in a
short period of time,

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.631 align:middle line:84%
probably because he
was already in shock

00:56:01.631 --> 00:56:02.880 align:middle line:90%
from all these other tortures.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And there was a point
where he asked his father, God,

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame him.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't want
to go through this.

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:10.953 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: I understood.

00:56:10.953 --> 00:56:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This was
incredible pain--

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:13.413 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: It was.

00:56:13.413 --> 00:56:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --regardless
of who he was.

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: And that's why I
said that in studying this over

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.390 align:middle line:84%
the years, just being a human
being and realizing what one

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:26.090 align:middle line:84%
human did to another here,
how can you not feel empathy

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:26.820 align:middle line:90%
for this man?

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And why?

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.802 align:middle line:84%
What did this man do to
deserve that kind of treatment?

00:56:30.802 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I can't
answer that, George.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.360 align:middle line:90%
But I can say this.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Just from one human
being to another,

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel great empathy for this
man and what he suffered.

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether it represents
my personal faith or not

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:90%
is not even a relevant point.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.140 align:middle line:84%
What is relevant is that what
they describe in the Gospels is

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.044 align:middle line:84%
documented here so precisely
that one skeptic once

00:56:52.044 --> 00:56:53.960 align:middle line:84%
said to me, I can't
accept the Shroud of Turin

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.650 align:middle line:90%
because it's too perfect.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.745 align:middle line:84%
So my response was, so
if it was less perfect

00:56:57.745 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:90%
then you'd accept it?

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And he said, of course not.

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And so that answered that.

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:03.867 align:middle line:84%
Once people have made up
their minds, that's it.

00:57:03.867 --> 00:57:05.700 align:middle line:84%
They've made up their
minds, and they're not

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.270 align:middle line:90%
going to change their minds.

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As a Jewish person--

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.198 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yes.

00:57:08.198 --> 00:57:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --if you can believe
that this indeed was the son

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.370 align:middle line:84%
of God, what does
that do to you?

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: Well, that would
make me a Messianic Jew.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage in
my life, I haven't yet

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:84%
felt the need to
make that transition,

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
if I will or not.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But I like I said,
I believe this,

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps being who
I am is exactly why I

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.870 align:middle line:90%
was given this work to do.

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm far more credible than if I
came in here as an evangelical

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.062 align:middle line:84%
or a Messianic Jew, somebody
who had converted over

00:57:39.062 --> 00:57:41.520 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, well, certainly
everybody would say, well,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of course you're
going to say that.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that I haven't
done that, I don't immediately

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.500 align:middle line:84%
feel that need to do it, even
though I'm asked frequently,

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I think perhaps that
gives me more credibility

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.710 align:middle line:84%
as someone speaking of this
sort of disassociated--

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I agree.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: --from that
emotional side of it.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And look what
it's done for your life.

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.154 align:middle line:90%
You're running shroud.com.

00:58:00.154 --> 00:58:03.004 align:middle line:84%
It does not generate
advertising revenue.

00:58:03.004 --> 00:58:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: No.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have
your own foundation.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.171 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: We do.

00:58:06.171 --> 00:58:08.665 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You are now
devoting your life to this.

00:58:08.665 --> 00:58:09.415 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Yeah.

00:58:09.415 --> 00:58:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I never expected that to happen.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:90%
But we did form a nonprofit.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.585 align:middle line:84%
I felt that the best way
for me to demonstrate where

00:58:15.585 --> 00:58:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming from-- I think
some people thought maybe

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I was doing it to
make some money.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I made a lot more money
as a producer and director

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.650 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles than
I do doing this.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But I felt obliged
from the first day

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that website went online to
keep advertising off of it.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:34.100 align:middle line:84%
There are people around
the world that view this.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ads
that might pop up

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.320 align:middle line:84%
might not be any problem
for you and I but

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.740 align:middle line:84%
could be very
offensive to someone

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in a different culture
and a different country.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.825 align:middle line:84%
So we've made a rule from the
first day no advertising on it.

00:58:43.825 --> 00:58:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: So we're
supported by my lectures,

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:84%
by my appearances, by
the licensing of some

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of the photographs
in our collection,

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and by contributions,
like any other 501(c)(3).

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So we always tell
people we will be

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.140 align:middle line:90%
happy to accept contributions.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.150 align:middle line:84%
We have some very
nice gifts that we

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.674 align:middle line:84%
give to people who
contribute to us.

00:59:02.674 --> 00:59:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Will we ever get
that answer that you're looking

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:08.030 align:middle line:84%
for, that I'm looking for, that
everybody in this audience,

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that everyone who's watching
this show that they're looking

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.670 align:middle line:90%
for?

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever find
out if this indeed

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.610 align:middle line:84%
was Jesus Christ,
the son of God?

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: I don't believe
science will ever be able

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to prove that.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So I always turn to
people and say, look,

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.390 align:middle line:84%
since the answer isn't on this
cloth, look in your own heart

00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:26.959 align:middle line:90%
and decide for yourself.

00:59:26.959 --> 00:59:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Barrie, thank you so
much for being on the program.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWORTZ: My
pleasure, George.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Barrie Schwortz,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.538 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWORTZ: Thank you.

00:59:32.538 --> 00:59:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Shroud.com.

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:90%
