>> George Noory: Is
America over medicated?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.839 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the questions we
ask today on  Beyond Belief

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.509 align:middle line:84%
with our very special guest
Harvard trained psychiatrist Dr.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.477 align:middle line:90%
Peter Breggin.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.179 align:middle line:90%
Peter, are we over medicated?

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter Breggin: Oh it's
totally out of control.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.616 align:middle line:90%
You know, we've got 20%

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.985 align:middle line:84%
of our boys getting
diagnosed with ADHD.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.522 align:middle line:84%
We've got 20% of women
on anti-depressant drugs.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, gosh.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: It's a catastrophe.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:01.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You're an author of
more than 20 different books.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:06.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: All dealing with
issues that effect all of us.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.903 align:middle line:84%
When you see these stories
of people probably being

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.771 align:middle line:84%
over medicated -- and
I know you've appeared

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.875 align:middle line:84%
on our radio show quite a bit
-- it's got to drive you nuts.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, in the
beginning it just made me

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.047 align:middle line:84%
so angry and now it's
just making me sad.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:24.451 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of in the stage
of what do human beings do

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.652 align:middle line:90%
to each other?

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.921 align:middle line:84%
And you might feel the
psychiatry George has been

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.291 align:middle line:84%
on the cutting edge of
doing bad things to people

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of hundred
years now.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And this mass drugging
of the country,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
which is taking place
really between psychiatry

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.868 align:middle line:90%
and the pharmaceutical industry.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.537 align:middle line:84%
Even though the pediatricians
are giving

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.604 align:middle line:90%
out drugs, and the interns.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yep, partnership.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: The family.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
It's really psychiatry
and the drug companies

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:52.946 align:middle line:84%
and that's a partnership
I've actually traced,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.613 align:middle line:84%
where you can look
at the minutes

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.684 align:middle line:84%
of the American Psychiatric
Association board meetings

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.587 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking
about back in the '70s,

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:90%
we're going to go broke guys.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.191 align:middle line:90%
We need an infusion of money.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And they went into a partnership
with the drug companies.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well one of the
big questions of course is,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.765 align:middle line:90%
is psychiatry dangerous?

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.504 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1938 German
psychiatry organized

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.107 align:middle line:84%
for the formal extermination of
its mental patient population.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.376 align:middle line:84%
First they started
with sterilization.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:84%
That's the genetic -- you know,
people are genetically inferior.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.214 align:middle line:90%
We'll sterilize them.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:30.016 align:middle line:84%
You can sterilize, the next
step is you can lobotomize.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.318 align:middle line:84%
You can lobotomize,
you can kill.

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:35.589 align:middle line:84%
And they actually set
it up out of Berlin

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:84%
so that every state hospital
sent in forms to Berlin --

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.196 align:middle line:84%
euthanasia forms -- and
then two professors voted.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.165 align:middle line:84%
One voted for death
the person was killed.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And the method of killing
was extremely organized.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.305 align:middle line:90%
There were six killing centers.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.274 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine you've
never heard this story.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.377 align:middle line:84%
There were six killing centers
with names you've never heard.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Sanenstein, Harheim.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.352 align:middle line:90%
And these centers were setup

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.088 align:middle line:84%
like medical scientific
laboratories.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.524 align:middle line:84%
The people thought they were
going for special treatment.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.294 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was called
"special treatment."

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.464 align:middle line:84%
They had gas chambers
with fake wooden soap.

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.566 align:middle line:90%
It was all done by psychiatry.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So Peter
we just saw that.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.237 align:middle line:84%
So you've been a psychiatrist
for a long, long time.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:27.307 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
attack your own profession

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.976 align:middle line:90%
but is psychiatry dangerous?

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Yes, the
film clip we just looked

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
at was the beginning
of my learning --

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.685 align:middle line:84%
long after my training -- just
how dangerous psychiatry was.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.388 align:middle line:84%
Because in your training
you don't learn

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.358 align:middle line:84%
that psychiatry was the
cutting edge into the holocaust.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:49.462 align:middle line:84%
You don't learn that psychiatry
developed the whole system

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.531 align:middle line:90%
of murdering people on mass.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.834 align:middle line:84%
Sending them in trains
to killing centers,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
and crematoriums,
and gas chambers.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:02.609 align:middle line:84%
All of this out of psychiatry's
so called "euthanasia program."

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.747 align:middle line:84%
This is just never shown to
young psychiatrist in training.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.985 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of experts at
the Nuremberg trials said

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.954 align:middle line:84%
that without psychiatry
as the entering wedge,

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:19.559 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish Holocaust, the Jews,
the Gypsies and all the groups

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.395 align:middle line:84%
that were slaughtered
might not have taken place.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:25.498 align:middle line:84%
Because psychiatry
showed you could do it.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:29.002 align:middle line:84%
And that -- that's literally
been observed by Andrew Ivy

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.404 align:middle line:84%
who was from the
AMA at Nuremburg,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.239 align:middle line:84%
and the German equivalent
of the AMA.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.241 align:middle line:84%
They all came out
with statements

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.643 align:middle line:90%
after the Nuremburg trial

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
that psychiatry was
the necessary beginning

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.548 align:middle line:90%
of the Holocaust.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:43.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are you glad you
went into this profession?

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:47.087 align:middle line:84%
Are you glad you
wrote books like this?

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I think it's
what I'm supposed to do.

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:51.925 align:middle line:90%
I mean to say I'm glad --

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:54.861 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's been a
very interesting ride.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.498 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing reform work
since I was a kid volunteering

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.468 align:middle line:84%
in state mental hospitals
when I was 18.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.705 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that none of my
friends do the same thing I do.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I was going to say
your peers must not be happy

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
things you talk about.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: No.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.448 align:middle line:84%
In fact imagine -- you know,
the worst whistle blower movie

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.549 align:middle line:90%
and all the things that...

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And there you are.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: ...there I am.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.388 align:middle line:84%
We've had everything
that you can imagine.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm taking on
not just psychiatry,

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.693 align:middle line:84%
but some of the largest
corporations in the world.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.828 align:middle line:84%
You know, doing expert
witness work.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
Exposing the inner working
of the drug companies.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:35.735 align:middle line:84%
I've taken on government
agencies head on.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Forced them to stop major
eugenically like programs,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.476 align:middle line:84%
that resemble somewhat
Nazi Germany.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.413 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I, Ginger,
back in the '90s, you know,

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:50.083 align:middle line:84%
we actually found out the
government was planning to go

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.319 align:middle line:84%
into the inner cities of
America to look for genetic

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.655 align:middle line:84%
and biochemical causes
of violence

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.023 align:middle line:90%
in little black children.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.492 align:middle line:84%
It was quite specific what
they were going to try to do.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.895 align:middle line:90%
It's racist, it's eugenically.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.696 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped that
program, cause --

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.498 align:middle line:90%
we caused a cancellation on it.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you went
through medical school and then

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:12.739 align:middle line:84%
when you got your advanced
degree in psychiatry,

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.408 align:middle line:84%
did you expect to
be doing this today?

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle line:90%
Talking about psychiatry.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.313 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the over
medication of America.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: No.

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.415 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd be the
youngest president

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.551 align:middle line:84%
of the American Psychiatric
Association.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: [Laughter] Sure.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Because I
was sort of like the top

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.155 align:middle line:90%
of the student crop [laughter].

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.091 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I'd have
a target on my back

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and literally be attacked

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.196 align:middle line:84%
by the American Psychiatric
Association.

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:38.665 align:middle line:84%
Have to get lawyers to
defend myself and so on.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:39.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Geeze.

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:43.002 align:middle line:84%
What was it that was the
changing part of your career?

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:47.807 align:middle line:84%
Where you went from
mainstream psychiatrist,

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.343 align:middle line:84%
to someone who questions
just about everything.

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:51.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, it
went in two phases.

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:55.748 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1954 I started --
I was at Harvard College.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.083 align:middle line:90%
Literally 18-years-old.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I led this volunteer
program in the state hospitals

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.956 align:middle line:84%
and it was so clear to me
that what people needed

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.659 align:middle line:84%
in these hospitals was
attention, and caring.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.229 align:middle line:84%
and relationship,
and empowerment.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.298 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need
lobotomies, shock and drugs.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:16.369 align:middle line:84%
So I went into psychiatry
thinking I could be a reformed

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.905 align:middle line:84%
because back in the
'50s there was a place

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
for young volunteers.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:22.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: To go and talk
to people about these things.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:25.411 align:middle line:90%
There was a branch of psychiatry

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.114 align:middle line:84%
that was social and
psychological.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:32.452 align:middle line:84%
But when the drug company's
came into complete partnership

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.988 align:middle line:84%
with psychiatry --
not a conspiracy --

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:36.022 align:middle line:90%
out front partnership.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:36.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It was direct.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:37.323 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it?

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Very direct.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.027 align:middle line:84%
Then things changed
and got even worse.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:44.197 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was just going
to go into private practice

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:49.102 align:middle line:84%
and in 1972 I found out that
lobotomy was coming back all

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:50.036 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:50.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And what
is the lobotomy.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:51.738 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:54.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, back
in the 1936 it started

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
with boring holes in
the head of patient.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: With a drill?

00:07:58.111 --> 00:07:59.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: With a drill.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.147 align:middle line:90%
We still do it.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:05.218 align:middle line:84%
Putting wires in or putting
what they called a lucatome --

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.786 align:middle line:90%
it was nothing but a spoon --

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:10.023 align:middle line:84%
and swishing it around
in the frontal lobes.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:12.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Like mixing
up your brain matter?

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Destroying.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:13.893 align:middle line:90%
Mutilating.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:14.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Literally?

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Mutilating's
the best word.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.698 align:middle line:84%
Mutilating the highest
centers of the brain.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:23.069 align:middle line:84%
And this was going on still
in the old fashioned way.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:26.606 align:middle line:84%
It was coming back in the early
'70s but also boring the holes

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.575 align:middle line:90%
and putting electrodes in.

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.044 align:middle line:84%
Then they would play with
the brain by stimulating it.

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.112 align:middle line:84%
Then they'd bore
holes in the brain.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:35.915 align:middle line:90%
This still goes on at Harvard.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:39.319 align:middle line:84%
But I needed up conducting
an international campaign

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:40.152 align:middle line:90%
to stop it.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's scary.

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:44.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, and -- and
the way psychiatry operates,

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.192 align:middle line:84%
there's always somebody
in psychiatry that's going

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.962 align:middle line:84%
to make it a big
political movement.

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I found
was that Harvard psychiatrists

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:56.369 align:middle line:84%
and neurosurgeons were
saying that the leaders

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.606 align:middle line:84%
of the black urban rights in
the '70s had brain disease

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:01.874 align:middle line:90%
and needed lobotomies.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.544 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out they
were lobotomizing little black

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:08.781 align:middle line:84%
children in -- in Jackson at
the University of Mississippi.

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up working
with the black caucus.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.086 align:middle line:84%
I ended up working
with women's groups.

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, after
maybe taking five years

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
out of my life I literally
stopped the return of the...

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You must have known

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.429 align:middle line:84%
that congressman John
Conyers from Detroit.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Oh, I
worked directly

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.332 align:middle line:90%
with john Conyers and...

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was a
good congressman.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why are
they doing this?

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:35.608 align:middle line:84%
Why are they doing these
crazy things to people?

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:39.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well I think it's
partly just a misshapen idea

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:90%
bout human beings.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.683 align:middle line:84%
Psychiatry comes and
always has come from an --

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:48.187 align:middle line:84%
of a materialistic idea
that we are biology.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:50.657 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you start
to think about people not

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:55.361 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, not
as souls or selves.

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.896 align:middle line:90%
Whatever your concept is.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:90%
To me we're souls.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: If you stop
thinking about people

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:84%
that way you don't get
neutral, you get destructive.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.307 align:middle line:84%
There's no neutrality
about being a human being.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:10.143 align:middle line:84%
So because psychiatry doesn't
see people as human beings

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:13.546 align:middle line:84%
but sees them as so-called
biological entities,

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.581 align:middle line:84%
it tends to get very
destructive,

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and then it does things
under the guise of science

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.153 align:middle line:90%
that have no scientific basis.

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:23.022 align:middle line:84%
I mean who can say
there's a scientific basis

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.024 align:middle line:84%
to mutilating the highest
centers of the brain?

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Or giving shock
treatment which is an...

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:28.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Scary.

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:29.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: ...lobotomy.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.397 align:middle line:90%
Or giving drugs to children

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.666 align:middle line:84%
so that they'll be
passive in school.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.169 align:middle line:84%
Or giving drugs to
women so that --

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
that they won't feel the passion
that's made them upset and angry

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.143 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, and
will suppress their need

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.279 align:middle line:90%
to deal with their lives.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:51.918 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a continuum
in psychiatry that goes

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:57.056 align:middle line:84%
from euthanasia which was
also discussed in America --

00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:00.793 align:middle line:84%
American Psychiatric
Association came out in favor

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.762 align:middle line:84%
of killing five-year-old
children

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:05.398 align:middle line:84%
when the Nazi's were killing
their mental patients.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:06.866 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
that happens...

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:07.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Something's wrong.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Yeah,
it's just so bad.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:13.272 align:middle line:84%
It's about not seeing people
for what we are and trying

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to see us differently.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:84%
That brings out the
worst in people.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:24.317 align:middle line:84%
And -- and psychiatry has been a
part of huge anti-life actions.

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:25.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Peter we're going to
take some phone calls

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.991 align:middle line:84%
for you during this program
and let's go to one right now.

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Kerri: Hi Peter,
my name's Kerri.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:38.297 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering what role
food has in human behavior.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:39.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's an
interesting question.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:84%
Food. You know, whether it's
a genetically modified food

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.071 align:middle line:90%
that you eat or something.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.774 align:middle line:84%
Does that affect
somebody's psyche?

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:50.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, I'm out of
my expertise with that one.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle line:84%
You're not the food
nutritionist.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I'm not the
food nutritionist person,

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:59.552 align:middle line:84%
but I really believe
that healthy living,

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:90%
eating right, exercising...

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure, that helps.

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:06.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...having higher
values I think goes into this.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.862 align:middle line:84%
Having a spiritual
concept of the universe.

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:11.164 align:middle line:90%
You know, what most of us think

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:14.867 align:middle line:84%
of is a really good life
is the ultimate answer.

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Not drugs and not
quirky nutrition

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.674 align:middle line:84%
but good solid nutrition I
believe is very important.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:23.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, me too.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.611 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I happen to be
a believer in the supplements

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:29.348 align:middle line:84%
and trying to take the
natural approach first.

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:32.051 align:middle line:84%
So let's say someone
comes into your office.

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.653 align:middle line:90%
You're a consultant now.

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:37.023 align:middle line:84%
But a patient wants
and has a problem.

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:39.192 align:middle line:84%
You don't medicate
anymore do you?

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:39.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: No.

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.294 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You refuse.

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Yes and I have -- I
have a private practice still.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.731 align:middle line:90%
I've been in practice since 1968

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.135 align:middle line:84%
and I've never started a
person an a psychiatric drug.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:54.207 align:middle line:84%
I only prescribe them if they
are already stuck on them,

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:56.976 align:middle line:84%
and if they would like to
try to come off of them.

00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.811 align:middle line:90%
You have to wean them off it?

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Oh yes.

00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:01.647 align:middle line:84%
It can be really dangerous
coming off psychiatric drugs.

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:02.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You can't
just stop like that.

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:03.916 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: No, if you've
been on for months...

00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A couple years.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Well, even months.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.321 align:middle line:90%
The brain changes.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:12.124 align:middle line:84%
See the brain despite
the Ely Lilly advertising

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:90%
that your brain needs Prozac,

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.995 align:middle line:84%
despite all the smiley
little faces bouncing

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
up and down on TV.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:84%
The brain hates psychiatric
drugs.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:84%
It immediately reacts to
it as a toxic intrusion.

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:31.244 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to change itself to
overcome what the drug is doing.

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:35.114 align:middle line:84%
And the end result is that
your brain is changed not just

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:36.849 align:middle line:90%
by the bad effect of the drug

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:40.453 align:middle line:84%
but by it's own attempts
to overcome the drug.

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:45.024 align:middle line:84%
So if you just stop a drug
outright it's very much

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:48.861 align:middle line:84%
like a severe alcoholic
stopping alcohol right away,

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.696 align:middle line:90%
going into the DT's.

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:54.267 align:middle line:84%
You really risk your
life stopping psychiatric

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.468 align:middle line:90%
drugs abruptly.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:57.069 align:middle line:90%
Has to be done carefully.

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.338 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully with clinical
supervision.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.706 align:middle line:84%
Of course I've written
a book about it

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:03.876 align:middle line:84%
which I hope people will
use with their doctors,

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.178 align:middle line:84%
with their therapists,
with their families,

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.214 align:middle line:84%
to help them come off
psychiatric drugs.

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We're with Dr. Peter
Breggin and one of his books

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
of course  Medication
Madness , which is all

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:15.855 align:middle line:84%
about what we're
talking about right now.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's take another call.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Joanne: Hi Peter, my name
is Joanne and I was wondering

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:25.464 align:middle line:84%
if you think there's
ever a reason

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:28.367 align:middle line:90%
to use the psychiatric drugs?

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:31.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well that's a question
I'm sure you get all the time.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.606 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.909 align:middle line:84%
People desperately want
me to make an exception

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:40.212 align:middle line:84%
because than -- prescribers
can make all the exceptions

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.183 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't one become
two and two become three?

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And so
on and so forth.

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:48.054 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
psychiatric drugs

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:51.524 align:middle line:84%
or any psychoactive
substances are the answer

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:54.827 align:middle line:90%
to human personal suffering.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:59.031 align:middle line:84%
When we suffer personally
because of issues with dealing

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.434 align:middle line:84%
with things that
have happened to us,

00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:06.205 align:middle line:84%
we have within ourselves the
power to face those issues

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.773 align:middle line:90%
and overcome those issues.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:09.342 align:middle line:90%
Without medication.

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:10.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Without medication.

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.212 align:middle line:84%
And the medication
is so bad George,

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:16.515 align:middle line:84%
because first it tells the
patient you're a patient,

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than a person
struggling with issues.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:20.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: It tells the
person who's struggling,

00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:84%
I'm the doctor, I have
answers -- excuse me George.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And we're not talking
about blood pressure medicine.

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:30.963 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
the cholesterol statins.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:37.703 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about prescription
grade psychiatric drugs.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Well that's right.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:43.542 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately some of the same
principles apply to statins

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.678 align:middle line:90%
and to other medical drugs

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.747 align:middle line:84%
because very often
the whole standard

00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:50.416 align:middle line:84%
around those drugs is set
by the drug companies.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.585 align:middle line:90%
But it's worse in psychiatry

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:54.887 align:middle line:84%
because in psychiatry
the whole idea

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.323 align:middle line:90%
that there's an illness is fake.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:01.427 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence that
anything that people suffer

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:04.163 align:middle line:84%
from when they go
routinely to psychiatrists --

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
Alzheimer's,

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:07.366 align:middle line:90%
which is a neurological disease.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:10.269 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about people
labeled schizophrenic...

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:11.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:13.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...bi-polar,
depressed and anxious, ADHD.

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:15.174 align:middle line:90%
No evidence they're genetic.

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:90%
No evidence its biochemical.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.846 align:middle line:84%
So the whole foundation of
psychiatry unlike the rest

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of medicine is built on a
mythology that compares it

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:84%
to medicine when psychiatry
should be about the struggles

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:33.559 align:middle line:84%
to be a human being, which
have been hard forever.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.895 align:middle line:90%
We've always struggled.

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So do you
find that -- and --

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.067 align:middle line:84%
and I get a kick out of
these disclaimers I hear

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.768 align:middle line:90%
on these pharmaceutical drugs.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:45.104 align:middle line:84%
Because right at the end you
have somebody who comes on

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.173 align:middle line:84%
and speaks so fast
like [inaudible].

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:52.711 align:middle line:84%
But they always talk about
the possibility of suicide.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: While you're looking

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
at a butterfly that's
really pretty.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, that's nice.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: And distracting.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:56.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Stuff like that.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:57.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why do these
prescription drugs

00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:03.155 align:middle line:84%
that are supposed to help
people induce the possibility

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.725 align:middle line:84%
of suicides and suicide
attempts?

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, our brains
are the most complex, subtle,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:84%
marvelous things
in the universe.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.667 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, my brain is
literally more complicated

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.634 align:middle line:84%
than the rest of the
physical universe.

00:17:16.634 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Life is infinitely complicated.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You cannot put toxic
junk into this operation,

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.746 align:middle line:84%
which we really is still
a mystery to us George.

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:28.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:29.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: you know, I'm
deep into neuroscience.

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:31.016 align:middle line:90%
Nobody...

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We don't
even know what it does.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:33.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: We don't know how
it works, how it makes you

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
and me talk [laughter].

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.021 align:middle line:90%
We don't know anything about it.

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:39.658 align:middle line:84%
And to put the toxic
junk in there is a game

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of Russian roulette and often
it's going to come out badly.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And every single study that
compares a psychiatric drug

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:84%
to a sugar pill shows the
psychiatric drug is causing

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.174 align:middle line:90%
emotional disturbance.

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:57.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What is
it supposed to do?

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:90%
I mean they developed the drug.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
What's it supposed to
do once you ingest it?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well my
colleagues usually

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:90%
like to say they don't know.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They don't know?

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.656 align:middle line:84%
They've made it,
but they don't know.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They don't know.

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.592 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and then they'll say, "We
don't know how aspirin works."

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.996 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what happens is

00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:21.934 align:middle line:84%
that all the psychiatric drugs
cause disability of the brain.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A shutdown?

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: It can be -- it's
always somewhat of a shutdown.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:29.742 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. It can also
jack up the brain.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:32.845 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not a person
feels helped just depends

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:36.582 align:middle line:84%
on whether -- for whatever
reason they want less

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:37.716 align:middle line:90%
brain function.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's, you know again,
the analogy to alcohol.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.957 align:middle line:84%
You may feel that alcohol
makes you want to relax.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.727 align:middle line:84%
You may feel it's bringing
out the best in you.

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:52.064 align:middle line:84%
It's actually impairing
your higher brain function

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:56.268 align:middle line:84%
across all the functions
of the brain and well,

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.504 align:middle line:84%
maybe you will be more
relaxed for a while

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.973 align:middle line:90%
but you also might be the death

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.175 align:middle line:84%
of the party rather
than the life of it.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.611 align:middle line:84%
You may actually not
be able to drive well

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:84%
and you may end up
injuring people.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:11.317 align:middle line:84%
Because the drug is giving you
false ideas about yourself.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I call that "medication
spellbinding."

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.224 align:middle line:84%
And this happens with all
psychoactive substances.

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:21.894 align:middle line:84%
They give people an
artificial sense at times

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:84%
of in particular having less
emotional suffering, less pain.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or euphoria.

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Or a mild euphoria.

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
If it get's serious it's mania.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.772 align:middle line:84%
And people will go from doctor
to doctor, and drug to drug,

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:37.876 align:middle line:84%
because they once had a euphoria
on starting an anti-depressant.

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Isn't it true that a
street drug that rots your teeth

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:41.981 align:middle line:90%
and does all kinds of things

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:45.217 align:middle line:84%
to you called Methamphetamine
is also used

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.553 align:middle line:84%
in the derivative
form for psychiatry?

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:52.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well for many years
Methamphetamine was used to give

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:56.128 align:middle line:84%
to children in psychiatry
as a prescription drug.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Amazing.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:01.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: But now, we're
using regular amphetamine

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:05.437 align:middle line:84%
which is quite similar to
methamphetamine and to cocaine.

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:09.008 align:middle line:84%
We're using Ritalin
which is methylphenidate

00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:12.478 align:middle line:84%
which in all textbooks,
all textbooks is

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:15.481 align:middle line:90%
in the same class as cocaine.

00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:16.915 align:middle line:84%
So we're giving speed
to our kids.

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And why do we do it?

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.953 align:middle line:84%
Because speed has an odd
effect on human beings.

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:25.658 align:middle line:84%
It also makes people
unable to be spontaneous

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and it makes them compulsive.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.264 align:middle line:84%
So your speed addict is
going to wash his car all day

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:84%
and he'll be very subdued
and he won't socialize.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.803 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens
to chimpanzees.

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:43.075 align:middle line:84%
So when you give it to children
in a classroom they sit quietly

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:46.245 align:middle line:84%
because their spontaneous
behavior is crushed.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:50.149 align:middle line:84%
They copy things off
the board because effect

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:54.086 align:middle line:84%
on the basil ganglia of the
brain makes them compulsive.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.256 align:middle line:84%
And when teachers are not told
what's happening they always

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.292 align:middle line:84%
rate those kids as improved
because the kid who wanted

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:02.594 align:middle line:84%
to get up and play
with his neighbor,

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.229 align:middle line:90%
or was throwing spit balls,

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
or the little girl
who's daydreaming

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
about her wedding someday,
which little girls love

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.469 align:middle line:90%
to do in elementary school.

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:11.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:12.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Or wherever
the kids are other

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
than in the boring
classroom at the moment.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.177 align:middle line:84%
All that stops when
you give them the drug.

00:21:18.177 --> 00:21:20.979 align:middle line:84%
Because you've taken
their imagination away.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:23.082 align:middle line:84%
You've taken their
spontaneity away.

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:27.353 align:middle line:84%
We literally are reducing
our children to automatons

00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:32.257 align:middle line:84%
to fit them into classrooms,
and evolution didn't intend

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:35.527 align:middle line:84%
for our children to sit in
classrooms all day in the middle

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:38.564 align:middle line:84%
of the tribe and listen
to some boring elder.

00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:43.302 align:middle line:84%
We grew as human beings to
be active and learn by doing.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:90%
To be out in the world.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.838 align:middle line:90%
It's a tragedy.

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.139 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous tragedy.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Do you think some

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.509 align:middle line:84%
of these pharmaceutical
companies know

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.945 align:middle line:84%
that their drugs
really don't work?

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Oh, there's
no doubt about it.

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean as soon as
Ely Lilly discovered

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.019 align:middle line:84%
that there were these
hundreds of reports coming

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.956 align:middle line:84%
out about violence and suicide
on Prozac they didn't say,

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:05.357 align:middle line:90%
"Oh let's investigate this."

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:08.894 align:middle line:84%
They formed a committee
to deal with it.

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:11.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It was too much
of a market share wasn't it?

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:12.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Oh, it
was so huge for them.

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:16.201 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
1.2 billion dollars.

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:19.671 align:middle line:84%
The whole company was
[inaudible] four billion.

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: 50%.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:23.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: 50% at the
time I was taking them on.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And through
the process of the FDA

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:27.813 align:middle line:90%
that approves these things

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:30.315 align:middle line:84%
and then very quickly
takes them off the market

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:90%
if something happens.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.719 align:middle line:84%
How does that procedure
get done?

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:36.188 align:middle line:84%
How does -- how does -- how
did these drugs get approved?

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:38.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
it's a terrible irony.

00:22:38.157 --> 00:22:41.226 align:middle line:84%
The first thing the company does
-- using Prozac as an example --

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.462 align:middle line:90%
is decide, ah, serotonin --

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.297 align:middle line:84%
we've got this new
neurotransmitter,

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.132 align:middle line:90%
let's make a drug for it.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.501 align:middle line:84%
So how do they make
a drug for it?

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:54.306 align:middle line:84%
They test rats until they find
a drug that disrupts serotonin.

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:57.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do you know that
a rat is depressed [laughter]?

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Oh well,
they -- normal rats --

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:00.712 align:middle line:90%
there's no question about that.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:04.383 align:middle line:84%
There's no pretense at even
making the rats depressed.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.718 align:middle line:84%
They just want a drug
that will disrupt the

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.687 align:middle line:90%
biochemical function.

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:10.322 align:middle line:90%
It's the only thing they can do.

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going
to find somebody

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.627 align:middle line:84%
that can prove the rat brain
function and then they start --

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:84%
before the drugs even approved,
developing a marketing plan

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:20.098 align:middle line:90%
that says it's going to fix...

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:21.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which is critical.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:22.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...a biochemical
-- well, that's right.

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:25.671 align:middle line:84%
Fix a biochemical
imbalance in humans

00:23:25.671 --> 00:23:28.407 align:middle line:84%
when all is has been
shown to do is the gum

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:32.211 align:middle line:84%
up the normal serotonin
processes in the brain.

00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:34.113 align:middle line:90%
It's that cynical.

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:36.148 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to
be too cynical.

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:38.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And then the
FDA panel members vote?

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:39.418 align:middle line:90%
Is this how this happens?

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:40.953 align:middle line:90%
They vote on the drug?

00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:42.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well when they
vote on the drug, you know,

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
they've got on their little
shoulders invisibly...

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A little lobbyist.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They're
actually on the take

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:51.129 align:middle line:90%
from the drug companies.

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:53.565 align:middle line:84%
The panel for Prozac
for example,

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
more than half the members were
given releases from the FDA

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.872 align:middle line:90%
so they couldn't be sued...

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Indemnified.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...because of the
fact that they were taking money

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:06.111 align:middle line:84%
from the drug companies
[laughter].

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Conflict of
interest everywhere.

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:09.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Rampant
conflict of interest.

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:13.652 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical
industry is so powerful now.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.087 align:middle line:90%
Well I'll give you an example.

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:18.891 align:middle line:84%
You know how little discussion
there's been of the Washington,

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:20.826 align:middle line:90%
D.C. Naval Yard shooting?

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Minimal.

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: We've had minimal.

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.097 align:middle line:90%
But you know why it's minimal?

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:28.967 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's one of the few
where we have the exact dates

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.403 align:middle line:90%
of him taking anti-depressants

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:34.039 align:middle line:84%
in the weeks leading
up to the shooting.

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Which leads
us into this,

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:84%
because you have been very,
very interested in our Veterans.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.882 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:47.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I was shocked at
what I found inside the company.

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:50.789 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
German equivalent

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:53.392 align:middle line:90%
of our FDA have become concerned

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:56.929 align:middle line:84%
that they were finding
an increased suicide rate

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:90%
on studies of Prozac.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:00.265 align:middle line:90%
So they asked Eli Lilly --

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:03.869 align:middle line:84%
and this is back now
in the late-80s --

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.372 align:middle line:84%
to go back and look at all of
their clinical trials and report

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:10.742 align:middle line:84%
to them, on the rate
of suicide attempts

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
in the control clinical trials
with the drug versus placebo.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Lilly found depending on how
you count it, a 6:12:1 ration

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.457 align:middle line:84%
of suicide attempts --
not just thinking --

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:31.229 align:middle line:84%
attempts in the controlled
group compared to placebo.

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:34.766 align:middle line:90%
Lilly never made it public.

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:37.736 align:middle line:84%
They never gave this report
that I found to the Germans.

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:41.573 align:middle line:84%
They never made it
available to the FDA.

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:44.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they come out
-- they come out of the war,

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:49.548 align:middle line:84%
they come out their service
and they're depressed.

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.316 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't what
they used to be.

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:52.851 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to handle themselves.

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: War changes
a person.

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:56.121 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:58.523 align:middle line:90%
And what they do first of all,

00:25:58.523 --> 00:26:01.126 align:middle line:84%
is to drug them up
before they go in.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:03.428 align:middle line:90%
In previous wars before Iraq,

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:07.633 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't be an active
duty on psychiatric drug.

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:10.869 align:middle line:84%
Now they force the soldiers
on the psychiatric drugs.

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:12.004 align:middle line:90%
I literally get phone calls.

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Amazing.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: From lawyers that
are -- they won't let George,

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.543 align:middle line:84%
Jack -- not George, Jack
[laughter] go into...

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:19.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or George.

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:20.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: ...or George go

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:23.248 align:middle line:84%
into combat unless he
takes the psyche drugs.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:26.885 align:middle line:84%
And the soldiers go
into 180 days renewable

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:29.655 align:middle line:84%
in their backpack,
19-years-old...

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:31.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they're
all popping these things?

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:34.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, they pop them,
they trade them, they don't want

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:90%
to take them regularly.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.663 align:middle line:84%
They have a combat stress;
they say well, if they told me

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:40.465 align:middle line:84%
to take one a day but I've
had stress, I'll take five.

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh my God.

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:41.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They're just kids.

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:42.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:43.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They're kids

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
with all these drugs
with no supervision.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.638 align:middle line:90%
Then they come back.

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:50.642 align:middle line:84%
Now they're wacked out because
the drugs cause symptoms

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:53.311 align:middle line:84%
that look like PTSD
and head injury.

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.647 align:middle line:90%
Then they have PTSD.

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:56.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: On top of that.

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: You can't go
through war without having...

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of course not.

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:00.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...a
horrible reactions to it.

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:03.689 align:middle line:84%
Then many of them in this
war have head injuries

00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:07.359 align:middle line:84%
from the improvised devices
going off around them,

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.127 align:middle line:90%
mortar shells dropping.

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.529 align:middle line:90%
So then what happens?

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:14.933 align:middle line:84%
They come back and on the way
back their drugs are increased.

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:84%
They get home on four, five
and six psychiatric drugs.

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.673 align:middle line:84%
They can't recover
on those drugs.

00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:22.774 align:middle line:90%
Nobody recovers.

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:23.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Then they get worse.

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:26.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They
get worse and worse.

00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:30.315 align:middle line:84%
And then they start dying
from cardiac arrest,

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:32.217 align:middle line:84%
suppression of central
nervous system.

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:34.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Or they go wacko
and they shoot people.

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They go wacko.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.588 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:40.158 align:middle line:84%
It's -- you know, the future's
going to look back on this --

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:44.629 align:middle line:84%
I hope and say, this is
worse than Brave New World.

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:47.099 align:middle line:84%
This is worse than
the predictions.

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:50.535 align:middle line:84%
Even in Brave New World
they weren't giving drugs

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:51.369 align:middle line:90%
to the children.

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:54.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Now is this worldwide?

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:54.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.641 align:middle line:90%
It follows the marketing.

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:58.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Follows
the worldwide market.

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:00.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: So first it's the
U.S. Well, it starts in the U.S.

00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:02.314 align:middle line:84%
because we are the
most susceptible.

00:28:02.314 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The most drug company influence
in the world is right here.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We're the test.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:06.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: We're
the only country

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.854 align:middle line:90%
that allows advertising...

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:10.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of drugs.

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...of prescription
drugs to the public.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.493 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens is

00:28:14.493 --> 00:28:16.728 align:middle line:84%
after it gets started
I follow the track.

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Because then Australia
TV calls me and says,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.799 align:middle line:84%
"We're drugging our
children here Dr. Breggin."

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.434 align:middle line:84%
Then German [laughter]
TV calls me.

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:23.702 align:middle line:84%
We're drugging our
children here.

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh God.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And it
follows the progression

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.874 align:middle line:90%
of the drug companies.

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:31.376 align:middle line:84%
And one of the points my
wife Ginger made that --

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:34.346 align:middle line:84%
that really opened my eyes
was they particularly look

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:37.916 align:middle line:84%
for the top down so they can
just get to one person --

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.951 align:middle line:84%
so they can just get
to one person high

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:90%
up in the military command.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's all you need.

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: That's all you need.

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.624 align:middle line:84%
Or you can get to one
person in the force

00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:48.126 align:middle line:90%
to care system in Florida.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You know? Or you get to one
person to two people in the VA.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.699 align:middle line:84%
You get to the school
systems through the Department

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:57.936 align:middle line:84%
of Education which has
promoted ADHD and drugs.

00:28:57.936 --> 00:29:01.907 align:middle line:84%
And you can just spread
these -- these downward.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:04.009 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Belief  of
course goes worldwide

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:07.679 align:middle line:84%
but our questions go
everywhere, as well.

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Wendy: Hi Peter, my name
is Wendy and I wanted to know

00:29:10.282 --> 00:29:12.984 align:middle line:84%
if you think bullying in
schools is partly the fault

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.152 align:middle line:90%
of the parents.

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Bully's in schools.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:19.758 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into that a lot
with you in our second program.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.994 align:middle line:90%
But what do you do about that?

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, I want to
make two points about it.

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We can start with
the school shooters.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.604 align:middle line:84%
Every single school shooter,
every one of them that we know

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:36.007 align:middle line:84%
of has been subjected to
humiliation and bullying.

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Either by his
parents or by his friends.

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:40.512 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:41.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.614 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them
as far as we know.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.583 align:middle line:84%
I don't have data on
the Connecticut shooter

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:47.919 align:middle line:84%
but his mother was obviously
profoundly disturbed.

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:90%
She had him out shooting gun...

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:50.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:50.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: ...and
buying him guns.

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:51.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They were her guns.

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They were her guns.

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:57.896 align:middle line:84%
All the others we have data on,
they were subject to humiliation

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.898 align:middle line:84%
and shame and that
leads to violence.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:02.133 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is every
one of them in addition

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to being bullied, just
about everyone past

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.839 align:middle line:90%
through the psychiatric system.

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.608 align:middle line:90%
So what does that tell ya?

00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:13.945 align:middle line:84%
It tells you that
psychiatry doesn't help

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.715 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatry may
be making it worse.

00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:19.584 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
what I've been saying,

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:22.954 align:middle line:84%
you get some kid who's
bullied, he's feeling ashamed,

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.056 align:middle line:84%
he's feeling angry,
he's feeling upset.

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He's got to lash out.

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, he
goes to the psychiatrist

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:90%
and the psychiatrist says,

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:31.563 align:middle line:84%
"Well there is something
wrong with you.

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.966 align:middle line:84%
You have a mental disorder and
you can't control yourself.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:35.867 align:middle line:90%
Here are drugs."

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:36.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:37.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They
even say to some

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.904 align:middle line:84%
of these kids you
have broken brains.

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:41.773 align:middle line:84%
You need something -- so
that's more humiliation

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:43.775 align:middle line:90%
from psychiatry.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:48.113 align:middle line:84%
And the lesson here is that
since psychiatry is touching --

00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:51.883 align:middle line:84%
almost all the shooters have
been through psychiatry,

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry is obviously
doing more harm than good.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:00.258 align:middle line:84%
And what these kids need is some
sort of intervention that deals

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:02.327 align:middle line:84%
with their shame and
their humiliation.

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:06.197 align:middle line:84%
That deals with the school
setting, the educational system.

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:11.002 align:middle line:84%
And in response to you
caller, puts a zero tolerance

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:13.571 align:middle line:90%
on bullying in our schools.

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yet they have a
bullying program going on now

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:17.876 align:middle line:90%
and they say it's not working.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I think
it's a moral issue.

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.813 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have lost
our moral background.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Principals are more afraid
of getting sued than they are

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.919 align:middle line:90%
of their children being bullied.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:31.156 align:middle line:84%
And we need a revolution,
a moral revolution

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:34.025 align:middle line:84%
where people start to
take seriously to kids.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:37.028 align:middle line:84%
Because these same principle's
are tolerating teachers

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:90%
referring children for drugs.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We need a moral revolution
starting with the kids

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that says no drugging,
no bullying.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.572 align:middle line:90%
We don't oppress our children.

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:49.941 align:middle line:90%
We offer them services.

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.376 align:middle line:90%
Kids need two basic things.

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:52.644 align:middle line:90%
Love and limits.

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:53.778 align:middle line:90%
Love and limits.

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
If you can find a way
to get love and limits

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.718 align:middle line:90%
to children they will thrive.

00:31:59.718 --> 00:32:00.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, if
you're ever in need

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:03.755 align:middle line:84%
of any psychiatric
help it's kind of nice

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.223 align:middle line:90%
to know there are a few doctors

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:07.359 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Peter Breggin
out there.

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:09.494 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back with
more additions

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of  Beyond Belief
in the future.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.631 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
