>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.370 align:middle line:90%

of the nationally syndicated

Coast-to-Coast AM and Gaiam
TV bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.875 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, well.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have looked up
into the heavens and wondered,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
just wondered, are we
alone in the universe?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, our guest on Beyond Belief
tonight devotes her entire life

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
to trying to answer
that question.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
She's an Italo-American
journalist.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Please welcome Paola Harris.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Paola!

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.839 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: I'm well.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would have
thought you would've

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
flown in on a
craft of some type.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.345 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I wish.

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.791 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.123 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I'm doing really well.

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still traveling
between Italy and the United

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.048 align:middle line:90%
States, going back and forth?

00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Italy, Spain,
Switzerland-- just all over.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.284 align:middle line:84%
In order to do this-- and
I'm a in-field researcher,

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
which means I've got
to go to the place.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't just do it on internet.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no internet
research with me.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I have to go there.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to speak to the people.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I go to the same
place two and three times,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know if I
really believe the story.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And George, you know
that these stories

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.767 align:middle line:90%
are outrageous, some of them.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of them are.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So one
of the questions

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you
know this is real,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and how do you know these
people are telling the truth?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it takes a long,
long time to figure it out.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't only want to do
research in the United States.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I do want to travel,
because believe it or not,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.395 align:middle line:84%
UFOs are an
interplanetary phenomenon.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.684 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's not an
American phenomenon.

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:11.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
someone in the eyes, Paola,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
can you generally tell if
they're telling you the truth

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, especially
if I go back there,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I did a story out of Italy
with Maurizio Cavalla who's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.614 align:middle line:84%
a contactee who gave me
Polaroid photos of aliens.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:27.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Polaroids.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.238 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Polaroids.

00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very difficult
to doctor a Polaroid.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.265 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And this happened in 1975
that he had his contact,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
so there's no Photoshop
and stuff like that.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Everybody credits Photoshop.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't show me
those until the second time

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I went to his house,
because he only

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to speak to me, which
was really interesting.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at these
Polaroids and these faces,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and I think I released
some on your radio show.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I said,
are you telling me

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
you really did go aboard?

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.654 align:middle line:84%
You really did take these photos
in the '70s, and this is real?

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, it's
hard for me to digest.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Isn't it hard for you?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's easy
for us to assume

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:90%
we're not alone in the universe.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Then it gets a little more
difficult when you have to say,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
well, they have
visited us, or maybe

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:90%
they've genetically altered us.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
talk to people who

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
say that they've been
abducted, they're contactees,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:84%
they've been on flying
saucers, they've been on craft.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to say,
well-- But there's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
still an air of
probability there,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and you can't rule it out.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I wouldn't
be doing my job if I just

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.890 align:middle line:84%
completely called him
crazy and walked off.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:90%
So I went there three times.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Then, I called my friend Heimi
Malsan from Mexico, and I said,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
get over here, because I don't
know if I can do this story.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You need to come here
and meet this man.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He came.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:90%
This is the story my life.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%
I met him in Milano.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We went on a train
with all the equipment.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:90%
We went there.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.333 align:middle line:84%
He did the story
with me, and he said,

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.852 align:middle line:84%
you know, Paola,
there's something here.

00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, thank
God you came, because--

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could feel it.

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
doing this alone--

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.744 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You needed that
cooperation, didn't you?

00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I need
that cooperation.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot better
if I interview--

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
like Bill Kirkland,
who worked at NASA

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and is a scientist who talked
about the Holloman landing

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and his being there.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Military people are easy for me.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Contact is really,
really difficult,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
because with the military and
the astronauts and the pilots,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.675 align:middle line:90%
you have credentials.

00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And astronauts.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And astronauts.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know Edgar Mitchell
as well-- oh my God!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Mitchell,
Apollo 14, walked on the moon,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is a staunch believer
that we've been visited.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, he did tell me, he
said George, honestly,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
when I went to the moon,
I never saw anything.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But he has said that people in
higher-up areas of government

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
have told him, Edgar,
these are real.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to believe that.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Also some
of his colleagues.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And he won't mention
some of the names,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
because there's
no way we can have

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
all these visits in
outer space and there's

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
nothing following
our space shuttle.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.677 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is out there is very
interested in the human race.

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Paola?

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
For years you've
been doing this.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.138 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: You keep asking me.

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Minimal pay.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
You've been all over the map.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
You do a lot of this out
of your own pocketbook.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, to
correct some people,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
there is no money in this--
not even in the books.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I do it from my own
pocketbook, because--

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:90%
intellectual curiosity.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:90%
I just want to know.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
In my lifetime, before I
pass on, I want to know.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're trying to
get your answers for yourself,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, but
because I've had

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
so many incredible military
witnesses who have begged me--

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
like Milton Torres, who
cried when I interviewed him.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
He was asked to shoot
down a UFO over England.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember him?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.982 align:middle line:90%
God rest his soul.

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He basically
couldn't tell his father,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because the British files
weren't released yet.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
This poor guy is
keeping this secret,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:90%
which is very heavy on him.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the British
files come out,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and he's able to go
to the X Conference

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and testify in front of
the Washington Press Club.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I have an obligation
to people like that.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
When he started to cry about it
because his father had died--

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't tell his father,
so his father never knew.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, look Milton,
the only thing

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I can do is just keep
your story alive.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I will try and tell the world.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
That is an obligation.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.515 align:middle line:90%
It's very heavy.

00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what happened
to that case, when

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
he was ordered to
fire onto this UFO?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
he said he saw it.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge UFO.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:90%
He said he locked onto it.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
He said that he was
so shocked that he

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
was ordered to
fire at this thing

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that he asked for
the codes again.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
He asked for the
codes again, and then

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.619 align:middle line:84%
when he was given
the codes to do it,

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:90%
the thing dematerialized.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof, it was gone.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, gone.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
landed, he was told

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:84%
not to talk about it ever-- not
even to his commanding officer.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So what you've got going
here is heavy secrecy.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You know we're not alone,
because you saw them.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We're ordered to
shoot them down.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is stupid.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.002 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's so stupid.

00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they've got the
kind of technology to get here,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't upset them too much.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't show them
much aggression.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Here's a question.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Are they showing
aggression to us?

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.235 align:middle line:84%
Is that why we're trying
to shoot them down?

00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I don't think so.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
From my 30 years
of research-- and I

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
talked about the appearances
on the Bikini Atoll

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.102 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific, when the French
were doing the hydrogen bomb

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:12.435 align:middle line:90%
testing-- 800 tests-- 800 tests!

00:08:12.435 --> 00:08:13.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:14.035 align:middle line:90%
800.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they
killed all the coral.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Three feet of dead
fish on the runway.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I'll tell you
a little story about that.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
When I interviewed Guy
Andronique that was there

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
on the island of
Fangataufa-- I had him

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in my apartment in Rome, because
I lived in Rome for 15 years,

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
did a lot of work there.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It's easier to work out of Rome.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I had
him sitting there.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
I got his testimony.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:90%
We went for pizza.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
When I came back, my
apartment was robbed.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:90%
The film was taken.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they took
not only the film footage.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.312 align:middle line:90%
They took jewelry.

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the seventh
floor in Rome, remember.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm the seventh floor.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And they took all my cameras.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:90%
They took my computers.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
It was quite dangerous,
and the courage

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of Guy Andronique--
it's in my first book,

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Connecting the Dots-- to
talk about the flyover--

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
this goes back to your
original question--

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:90%
the flyover, twice, of UFOS.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
So three UFOs see this insanity.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They're flying over the
island in the Pacific.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't do anything.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:84%
They're watching
all this dead fish,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
coral and everything and Guy
says they jump on an airplane

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and follow them, which is
the craziest thing I've ever

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:90%
heard of.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said the instruments
on the airplane froze,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.777 align:middle line:84%
but as they went over the
horizon, they came back.

00:09:34.777 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
They came back, thank God.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, Guy and
everybody onboard

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:90%
the plane would have died.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So do I interpret
it as aggression?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
sure of that?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.925 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I think
they could be aggressive

00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:52.614 align:middle line:84%
if we shot first, or
if we had a space war.

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
because there have

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
been cases of
missing craft, right?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.056 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Our craft-- gone!

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.045 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or wasn't there
some radio transmissions

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:90%
of a pilot once?

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
He was in his Cessna, reporting,
I'm seeing this large object.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
It's coming up to me.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It's close-- gone.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever heard
from him again.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:90%
They can't find his plane.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.154 align:middle line:90%
I think it swallowed him up.

00:10:16.154 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It probably did,
but if you remember Close

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Encounters--

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they
brought them back.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Do you remember that?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
They brought them back.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So where does Hynek
and Vallee who

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
were the consultants with
Spielberg-- and by the way,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
we need to speak about
Spielberg eventually--

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
where do they get off portraying
that these pilots are coming

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:84%
off and just, oh yeah, checking
them off one after another.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.181 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this going,
what do you have in your files

00:10:43.181 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
with appearances--

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you know this?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.098 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: How do you know
this with appearances

00:10:47.098 --> 00:10:48.764 align:middle line:84%
not only of pilots,
but of artifacts?

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.805 align:middle line:84%
They found that boat in
the middle of the desert.

00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, or all
those planes that

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
were brought back that had
disappeared-- those Avengers.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.009 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
People say, how did
you ever get into this?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Why would you ever do this?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Even my own family
goes, why don't you

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.322 align:middle line:90%
go to work for UNICEF?

00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:10.467 align:middle line:84%
So I go, UNICEF
is not like this.

00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:12.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's exciting
to do UFOs, right?

00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it kind of
touched a spot in my heart

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
when I saw Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a great movie.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:90%
That was in the '70s.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that explicitly.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember old J.
Allen Hynek, who

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
used to work for Project
Blue Book, as you know.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.686 align:middle line:84%
Then, he became his own
consultant and a believer.

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
He'd walk out with the
pipe, and that was all

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
based on his book, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.844 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, tell me,
how did you react to it?

00:11:36.844 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the movie?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.129 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I loved it.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I have always been interested
in UFOs, since I was a kid.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
My mother brought be home a
book that Walter Sullivan, who

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
used to write for the New
York Times-- it was called We

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Are Not Alone.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reading that
at the ripe age of 13,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
14 years old, going, my
gosh, this is unbelievable.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And then Look magazine
came out with the story

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:84%
of "The Interrupted Journey
of Barney and Betty Hill,"

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the abduction case
from New Hampshire.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So at a very young age,
that's what I wanted to do.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I joined as a teenager NICAP,
the National Investigations

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:90%
I was a boy wonder.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
I was into UFOs.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I read every book that was
ever written during that time

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
by Frank Edwards, the old
journalist, and people

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself, I
want to go into this field.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I want to uncover this aspect.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And news directors would
tell me, George, you

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:90%
can't cover that story.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Nobody cares about UFOs,
and I went, no, there's

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:90%
a big market for UFOs.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Stanton Friedman was
one of my first guests.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm obsessed
with this, Paola,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
so when I have an opportunity
to talk to people like you who

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
are true investigators,
I mean, it's just

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
like a kid in a
candy store for me.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Paola Harris.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
She investigates
UFOs and the search

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:90%
for extraterrestrial life.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a question for us?

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Of all the
places that you've gone to

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to research UFOs
and stuff, what is

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the most interesting case
you've ever investigated?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.514 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
investigated many, Paola,

00:13:12.514 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
but which one stands out
for you as one of the best?

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.138 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: First of all, thank
you for asking that question,

00:13:17.138 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and I'm so glad you're young.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.325 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for young
people to work on this.

00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
We old people-- or I,
I'll speak for myself--

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
need to have more younger
participants in investigations.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.145 align:middle line:90%
But New Mexico-- Roswell.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:32.366 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, yes.

00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:90%
1947.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, in 1947.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was a case
before 1947 that I

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
covered with George on Radio
Two called San Antonio Crash, 30

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
miles away from the
Trinity site where

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:90%
the atomic bomb was exploded.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
in August of 1945,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and so I found out from
looking at Corona, Aztec, all

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.605 align:middle line:90%
these other--

00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: areas.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Areas, that that
area around New Mexico--

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and Roswell's three
hours from San Antonio,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:90%
near the Trinity site.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Somebody was interested in us.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Somebody, starting in 1945 when
that bomb was exploded to 1947,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
was interested in what
we were doing there

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
because to have that many
crashes-- and by the way,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
people say, well, how
come they crash if they've

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:90%
got this incredible technology?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.246 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
a good question.

00:14:34.246 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It is a good question.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But we had very
high-powered radar,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
which I hear was even portable,
and evidently this radar

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:90%
acted like a weapon.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It interfered with the
navigation systems.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.108 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Screwed
up their guidance.

00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when whoever in the
military that were down there

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
saw this happening-- and I'll
talk about Colonel Philip

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Corso, what he told me.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.964 align:middle line:84%
He told me that when he was the
head of the missile battalion

00:15:03.964 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
there, he was actually
told to shut down

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
his radar during certain
times of the day, which

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:90%
means that this interfered.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And so these crashes
or these anomalies

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
happened with these beings.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
the most for me

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.666 align:middle line:84%
was that who was there at the
time was Robert Oppenheimer.

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Father of
the atomic bomb.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Killer of worlds.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, even
Oppenheimer said that.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And Oppenheimer and Einstein
wrote a letter in June 1947--

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
it's in the MJ12 documents--
to President Truman,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and the letter is
entitled "Relationships

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.772 align:middle line:90%
with Celestrial Bodies."

00:15:48.772 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
It's got the word celestrial.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So what they're staying
in that letter is,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
hey, we opened a Pandora's box.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:84%
What happened here was
that we exploded a bomb,

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and guess what happened?

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
We got visitors.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So they asked Truman what
international structure could

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
handle visitations from
other galaxies and so forth.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
United Nations can't do it,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:84%
so we need to create a
supra-United Nations,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
a group of people that are going
to handle this contact should

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:90%
it ever--

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In secrecy.

00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They
did it in secrecy,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:84%
but I think that Oppenheimer
and Einstein wanted

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
to handle it formally later on,
because they were fascinated

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:90%
with what was inside.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.685 align:middle line:84%
Thank God for that, because
most of the military

00:16:39.685 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
is only interested
in the technology.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's have
another question

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:90%
or two for Paola Harris.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.632 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am?

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So you've
traveled the world.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Where do the most
sightings occur,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and what are your thoughts
with regard to Area 51?

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Those are
two big questions.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just knowing that
it's probably more accepted,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
most sightings are in
Mexico-- South America.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have a
colleague, Heimi Maosan

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
who is amazing, because
people just give him videos.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you go on
his site, you'll

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
see all the videos--
but up close

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and personal videos,
not lights in the sky.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, craft during
the day videos.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.771 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can see structure.

00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah,
and then the flotilla--

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
those orbs that are
like, 200 and 300 orbs,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're not balloons, going
across the skies of Mexico.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And not only Mexico, but Peru,
Argentina, Venezuela, Chile.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
if you go there,

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:90%
the people consider it normal.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Nobody laughs.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:90%
They see a sighting.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll call it in,
and it's normal.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.464 align:middle line:84%
What's difficult about
the United States--

00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be honest
with you, because I'm

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
an international
journalist-- is it

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is extremely
commercialized here.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So what you see is
people wearing t-shirts

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:90%
with a Gray stamped on it.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you see gadgets
and t-shirts and that kind

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of thing-- which we
don't do in Europe.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.158 align:middle line:84%
You have a conference
there, nobody

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
sells anything except books.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.696 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Books, right.

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Books.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or DVDs.

00:18:15.248 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Or DVDs, right.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
People are afraid to say
that they believe because

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
of the commercialization
around the subject here,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's too bad.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel really bad,
because this is serious.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:90%
I think it's serious, isn't it?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, it really is.

00:18:30.773 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And as far as
Area 51-- good grief.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
going on there.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We've interviewed, we've
talked with a number

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:90%
of people-- the Bob Lazars.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
There's something
very strange going on.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
In addition to it, of course,
being a secret military

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
base in terms of
high-performance technology.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I think drones were developed
there and things like that.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.166 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else going on there.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's underground,
most of it, isn't it?

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's
many levels underground.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a test facility.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they doing down there?

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, whatever
they're doing down there

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:84%
comes up there,
because it causes

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.187 align:middle line:84%
a problem for UFO
investigators, because we

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
don't know if it's our
stuff or their stuff.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's gotten to that point now.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's our stuff, we're
thinking it's a UFO,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's our stuff.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So it really throws a monkey
wrench into the whole thing.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have interviewed Ed
Fouche, who worked there.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
S-4 is the area in Area 51
where a lot of this goes on.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It's an area of Area 51.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And he worked on the TR3B,
the Aurora, and so forth.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.377 align:middle line:84%
He spoke for a very short
time, wrote a book called

00:19:39.377 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Alien Rapture.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
He spoke for a very short
time, and then he clammed up.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people that
do talk about Area 51,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
like Bob Lazar, go
underground, because--

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, they have to.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's dangerous.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.886 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have to.

00:19:52.886 --> 00:19:55.457 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more
question for Paola Harris.

00:19:55.457 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Have you
investigated crop circles,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and if so, what message do you
think they're trying to tell us

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
sacred geometry?

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
a great question.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Crop circles, crop
formations, of course,

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is the expertise of our dear
friend Linda Moulton Howe,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and she does a great
job doing that.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:90%
You've got to marvel.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.115 align:middle line:90%
You've got to say, what is this?

00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:90%
How are they created?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yes, most of them
are probably made by man.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But even if there's one that is
made in a very supernatural way

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
or unusual way, it's got to
make you say, what is this?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I have thought, Paola,
that the possibilities were

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial-- sending
some kind of a message

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
through geometry, the planet
is alive, just like we are,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's communicating with us,
trying to tell us something,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
or also, it's extraterrestrials
doing it through a vortex

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
system, like a little wind, just
whoosh, like and etch-a-sketch.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they are?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, you gave a
really good answer to that.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't do crop circles,
so I'll be really honest.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't do certain
areas of ufology,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and I can't pronounce myself.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you my experience.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, when
I lived in Italy,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Michael Glickman,
who analyzes sacred geometry.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
In the olden days, about
10 years ago, most of them

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:90%
were not the human-made ones.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were intricate, and
they were impossible to make.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think those are
messages of some kind.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But since Colin Andrews is
my good friend-- and I do

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:90%
ask people.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I think in my research, I
have a lot of colleagues

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
that I consult on
this-- and you know

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
what Colin told me, which
is really interesting?

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, a great deal
of them are made by artists,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
but they begin the formation,
and then they let it go.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, it's
completed by itself.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody finished it.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I know!

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, if somebody finishes it,
who is it that finished it,

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and how did those artists get
the idea in the first place?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So when he told
me that, he said,

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:84%
well, it's OK that it's
being created by them,

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
because they're getting a
download from somewhere.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It's all paranormal, and maybe
we don't know the reason why.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And you gave some
really good explanations

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
about the living earth.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:90%
I love that idea.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.384 align:middle line:84%
Also, the fact that
there's water underneath.

00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something going on.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.336 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Water creates this.

00:22:29.336 --> 00:22:31.877 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you like to be
an artist and start a painting,

00:22:31.877 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and in the morning,
it's finished.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's finished.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
Picasso waiting for you.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to encourage people to
look at all research, and not

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
just internet research,
because I think

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
somebody like Colin Andrews,
who's got a new book also

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.761 align:middle line:84%
coming out-- these people
are real researchers.

00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
They've been out in the field.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they devote
their lives to this stuff.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.006 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They
devote their lives.

00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a great networker
for these people,

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because-- like Linda Howe, who's
totally amazing-- if we didn't

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.627 align:middle line:84%
have Linda-- first of all,
she's a woman, so I go,

00:23:01.627 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:90%
oh, thank God.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.145 align:middle line:90%
There's women in the field.

00:23:03.145 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:90%
There's not a lot.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: There's not a lot.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So we need to really
recognize them.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
earlier Steven Spielberg.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Great director.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Love his films, from Jaws on.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Close Encounters of
the Third Kind and ET,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
the Extraterrestrial
were interesting movies.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
There were messages behind
a lot of the things we saw.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you think he was
given and is still

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
being given inside
information, and then he

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
just kind of injects
it into the films?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people would
say, this is being

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
done to kind of educate
us, to kind of prepare us,

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to get us ready for some
kind of major announcement.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
The guy's got to be one of the
most creative people out there,

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
which he is, but
I think somebody's

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:90%
telling him something.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I teach
a course called

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.462 align:middle line:84%
"Hollywood and Disclosure,"
and I have a clip that I show,

00:24:00.462 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg
when he's speaking

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to the kids at the
Actor's Studio.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's not going
to lie to kids.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to lie.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And one girl says, can you give
us the importance of listening?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Plus, do you believe in aliens?

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
She shoves it in there.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And he gives this real
beautiful explanation

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
of listening, which is
what Alan Hynek taught me.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.304 align:middle line:90%
I worked with him for six years.

00:24:25.304 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, Paola,
even though you're

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
making a judgment when
you're hearing testimony,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:90%
do not interrupt.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Let them talk.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end, he goes,
I do believe in aliens.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh my
God, he's telling

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
the kids he believes in aliens.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And THEN I think, what does
he have to do with children?

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So here we've got ET, which
is filled with children.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We've got Artificial
Intelligence which

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
he did with Kubrick,
and we have--

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another great movie.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.335 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
He has a kid named
David, just like 2001.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you want
to go to the Bible

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
and see the importance of David.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But then Close
Encounters, Barry,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
the little boy that looks
up and says, ice cream.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:84%
When he sees it-- goes
right to the ship.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:90%
They take him.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:90%
He goes by.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:84%
This is an interpretation that
this director has of contact.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it seems
to be pretty accurate.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It could be, yeah.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the
end, because that's

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
what moved me, the end,
when Francois Truffaut does

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the hand signals to the beings.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.013 align:middle line:84%
The craft opens, and
there's a mantis-like thing.

00:25:39.013 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Then all at once, you
see these little children

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that look exactly
like Barry coming out,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:90%
these little beings.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, what's going
on in Spielberg's mind?

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Does contact have
to be childlike?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to suspend judgment?

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to be like a child?

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.765 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to be like Barry
and say, wow, those colors.

00:26:01.765 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bye!

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.425 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Bye!

00:26:03.425 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK, that's his
interpretation initially,

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
but then Spielberg
went-- and then

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Missing, when he did the
miniseries-- there's a child.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There's a
child that's psychic.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And didn't
he also do Taken?

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, Taken.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Taken, not missing.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Taken is with the little
child that's psychic.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So the little child gets these
psychic powers from contact.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad you're including
the paranormal and everything.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I've got to open
up to all of it,

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's all in there--
the paranormal, the psychic,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
the remote viewing, all of that.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
I think that Spielberg

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is saying that children are
the ones-- that maybe it's

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
a new generation
that are maybe going

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:90%
to be the most important here.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a
little bit about what's

00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:90%
going on at the Vatican, Paola.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:90%
You're from Italy.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You've been there.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:90%
You've been to the Vatican.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.757 align:middle line:84%
They have talked about
extraterrestrial life.

00:26:56.757 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I just happen
to live about three blocks

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
from St. Peter's, so that
was my walk on the way

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to buy groceries.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Up the street lived
Monsignor Balducci,

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and he was a
spokesperson for ET life

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.594 align:middle line:84%
that is not connected with
the devil, because Monsignor--

00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:18.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a demonologist.

00:27:18.885 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He was a demonologist.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book, and
people have asked me--

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.540 align:middle line:84%
the book is only in
Italian, called Il Diavolo.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he came forth very
courageously and said,

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
the devil doesn't need
UFOs, but let's look

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
at if God, in order to
have a beautiful creation,

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
created more than
one type of being.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because there's like,
50 million butterflies

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and different species that
are created, various species.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Why would he create one type
of human, when in nature we

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
have a reproduction
of different species?

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look at the
species on this planet.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Countless, hundreds of
thousands, if not millions.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're all similar,
but they're all different.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's the
argument he used, George,

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
a good argument.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I spoke with
him all over Europe.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I used to go there for
dinner at his house--

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.873 align:middle line:84%
and miss him tremendously,
because we lost him,

00:28:15.873 --> 00:28:19.290 align:middle line:84%
as you know-- and brought him to
the X-Conference in Washington,

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:84%
DC, for Stephen Bassett
so he could testify.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:84%
He said that humanity
was not evolved.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We were on the bottom
rung of the ladder,

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and that whatever
is out there, that

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't bother with
probably soap operas

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and killing each other and
wars and all this stuff,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:90%
can travel among the stars.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot for us, and
he's absolutely right.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
We're land-bound
here, because we've

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
got so many problems
on this planet.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
We can't go anywhere.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
sanctioned by the Vatican?

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think maybe they
said, do this on your own,

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.806 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
to let you do it?

00:28:53.806 --> 00:28:55.715 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They said,
do this on your own,

00:28:55.715 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
to let you do it.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But Pope John Paul listened
to Balducci on the radio.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He told him
that he listened to it.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could've stopped
him if they wanted to, right?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.721 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness, yes.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.302 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:29:08.302 --> 00:29:10.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd just say, you
don't talk about that stuff.

00:29:10.718 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He's under orders.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.252 align:middle line:84%
But then you have Father
Funes, which is, I think,

00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:90%
what you're getting at.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, Father Funes, who is
the chief astronomer of Castel

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Gandolfo, the big major
observatory there.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And the one in Arizona says--

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
the Vatican have

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.275 align:middle line:84%
an-- we'll talk about
that, by the way.

00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Why would they have?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Observatory.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.617 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Why?

00:29:36.617 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're looking for.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they looking for?

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about him.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.764 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're probably
interested in the Second

00:29:41.764 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Coming of Christ,
but I don't think

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that's what they're looking for.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They could be looking
for asteroids.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But what Father Funes
said interests me,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because it was printed
in L'Osservatore Romano,

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the official
Vatican newspaper.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It was not printed in the
National Enquirer, OK?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And he said three things.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.047 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the ET is
our brother and sister.

00:30:05.047 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge story.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Which means
that they look like us.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That's not the little beings
that go running around,

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
biological entities.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Number two, he said it is
not against your religion

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to believe in
extraterrestrial life,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because people are
questioning that.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Number three really got
to me, because it's dogma.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, Jesus didn't
need to die for them,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
because they were not
born with original sin.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So when he said that, I'm
going, how do you know?

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Who've you been talking to?

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
They were not born
with original sin,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.694 align:middle line:84%
so Jesus didn't need to go
to other planets to die.

00:30:41.694 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that had
been a question--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we were?

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, see?

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I think dogma or
principles in Catholicism

00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
may have to adjust to a reality
if we ever have formal contact.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think they
position themselves

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
in a formal newspaper
to look at that.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So the next question
for a journalist

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
like me is, are we going
to have mass contact

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.322 align:middle line:84%
and then they have to
figure out what to say?

00:31:16.322 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe they
already know that.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they already know that.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.598 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They do,
but the world doesn't,

00:31:21.598 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't had anybody
landing on the White House

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.194 align:middle line:90%
lawn yet.

00:31:27.194 --> 00:31:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
Vatican has a file on ETs?

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in Porto, Portugal, at
a conference two years ago,

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.925 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to
Joaquim Fernandez--

00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and he'd be a great guest--
who really went to Fatima

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and examined that miracle
of the sun was not the sun.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It's on my Facebook.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a picture of a UFO.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They said
the sun came down.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.505 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:31:49.505 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what they
saw was probably a silver

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.824 align:middle line:84%
shaped disc in front of
the sun, and it gave it

00:31:55.824 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that whole feeling
and perception.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And it came down.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it did come down.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And it was raining.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And within minutes--

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
were witnesses,

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:90%
thousands of witnesses.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And within
minutes, everybody was dry.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
The umbrellas, it's raining.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a miracle,
all right, but we

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
have to look the message around
whoever was there-- this lady.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
This lady that Joaquin
Fernandez told me she looked--

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
she had this cape that had--
not a veil, but a cape--

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
the lady they think

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:90%
was the Virgin Mary, right?

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, that's
your interpretation

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
through the glasses of
the religious group.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the kids-- they don't know
anything about outer space,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
so they're interpreting
what they saw.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And the messages are
what is important,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the idea of consecrating
the Sacred Heart to Russia,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to have peace and not have
the communist situation we had

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
there, and to end the war
and all this kind of thing.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So the messages of peace, the
messages of unity and harmony

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:90%
are the most important things.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.725 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
who gives them.

00:33:00.725 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
who gives them,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but somebody up there
is looking out for us.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
interesting-- on the day

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:84%
before the vision
at Fatima, people

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:84%
reported seeing an object
up there in the sky--

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
not the sun coming down,
not the flying disc--

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.199 align:middle line:84%
but some kind of an
object before that.

00:33:17.199 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So that very well could
have been the same thing.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
well, the picture

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that I have on my Facebook is
from the L'Osservatore Romano,

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
because in those
days, I don't think

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.570 align:middle line:84%
there was the censorship
there is today,

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
so there is a
picture of an object.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing stuff.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit
about the abduction.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You were a dear
friend with John Mack,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Harvard-trained psychiatrist,
who's no longer with us.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Tragically died in England,
stepping off the curb

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.919 align:middle line:90%
and got hit by a drunk driver.

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And you believe that
was an accident?

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Because I was in Florence.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A tragic accident.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.843 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I was
in Florence with John.

00:33:52.843 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:84%
He's very tall, six foot four,
and had to keep elbowing him

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.450 align:middle line:84%
back on the sidewalk,
because he was so interested

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.980 align:middle line:84%
in the architecture,
the Renaissance--

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wasn't
looking, was he?

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:01.696 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, he wasn't.

00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:90%
He was bent over like this.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I kept elbowing him.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, these
little motorini,

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
these little
motorcycles, are going

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.484 align:middle line:84%
to hurt you, because they
just race like crazy.

00:34:11.484 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he'd be
walking across the street,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.194 align:middle line:90%
just looking around?

00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.714 align:middle line:90%
And I said, John--

00:34:15.714 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do that in
New York, you're gone.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: You're gone.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.921 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, too, you get
hit by a motorcycle.

00:34:20.921 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
So I believe it was an accident.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But at 10:30 at night, to
walk around alone, and then

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:84%
you look on the
opposite side, you know,

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
when you cross the
street in London.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.793 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sad.

00:34:31.793 --> 00:34:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he was an expert
in alien abductions.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:90%
He would look at cases.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:84%
He literally changed
his psychiatric practice

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to concentrate on this.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:90%
You were very close with him.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
What did he think?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:90%
What did he say about this?

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He thought,
like Monsignor Balducci,

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
that the witnesses
should be listened to.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:84%
He's a hero, because he had
to fight the establishment.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
In psychiatry at Harvard,
they thought he was crazy,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and they came around eventually.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
thought that whatever

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
was contacting the
people could be

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%
like a dimensional
abduction, rather

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:90%
than a physical abduction.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
His books, Passport
to the Cosmos,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Abductions and so forth--
they're incredibly books,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:90%
because they have case studies.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of his life
when he was talking to me,

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
he said, you know,
Paola, we have

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
fewer of the
physical abductions.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.589 align:middle line:84%
We're getting direct downloading
now, synchronicities.

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went
to high-tech, huh?

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.210 align:middle line:84%
What's happening, he said,
is a lot of my colleagues

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
are getting ideas,
synchronicities, downloads.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
getting downloads.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And he believed all
that was connected

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
to a higher civilization.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing, he said,

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
unless we change our
world view, which

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:84%
is like Columbus believing
that the world is round,

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to be able
to accept this reality.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
in the old days,

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the abductions were
some kind of, I believe,

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:90%
hybridization program.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They physically needed to
genetically manipulate and play

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:90%
with the male, with the female.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they got to a
point where they said,

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:90%
we've done enough of that.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
do that anymore.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, in Artificial
Intelligence, which

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.460 align:middle line:90%
is a great movie, remember that?

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember the aliens going
to David and saying,

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:90%
humanity has destroyed itself.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:90%
You're the only memory we have.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I want
to see my mother,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and he had a piece of hair.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And they took the DNA
from the piece of hair,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and they created his
mother, and the beings

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
said, with a lot of compassion,
we don't want to lose humanity.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So they created his
mother for a day.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe on a weirdo timeline,
we're going there.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we go there, there
won't be anything left.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a
hybridization program

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.200 align:middle line:84%
is needed, because they
can see a timeline.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Now with UFOs, it's
so complicated.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.567 align:middle line:84%
You get into time
travel, quantum physics--

00:37:02.567 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dimensions.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.275 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Dimensions.

00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:05.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other universes.

00:37:05.715 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Remote viewing,
all that kind of stuff,

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.975 align:middle line:90%
which makes this so interesting.

00:37:10.975 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You also get
into what David Jacobs has

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
said is a technique of possibly
something very dangerous.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:84%
He believes that the ET
presence is not good,

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.182 align:middle line:90%
and that's kind of scary.

00:37:28.182 --> 00:37:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
in my research, I

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:33.372 align:middle line:84%
haven't found that
kind of result.

00:37:33.372 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We shouldn't
be panicking?

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not War of
the Worlds all over again?

00:37:37.245 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I don't think so.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Why would anybody
want us, anyway?

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we have emotions,
and I think that maybe

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:90%
an advanced culture doesn't.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think we need to
remember one thing-- that there

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.680 align:middle line:84%
are 57 different
races, and whatever

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.240 align:middle line:84%
is doing the
abduction is certainly

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:90%
not the ones that Odemski saw.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not the Amicizia case,
the friendship case in Italy.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They are not the ones that
Billy Meier saw, the Pleiadians.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have different alien
agendas with different alien--

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and I"ll call it what Einstein
called it, celestrial people.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.050 align:middle line:90%
So we have different agendas.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.695 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
tremendously interesting.

00:38:20.695 --> 00:38:23.416 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Einstein believe
in extraterrestrial life?

00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:25.587 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, how could he not?

00:38:25.587 --> 00:38:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He might have been one.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Way too smart.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There's a
quote in a movie where

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.160 align:middle line:84%
they say Einstein
was one of them.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Was it Close Encounters?

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have
been Close Encounters.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But he was down at
the Trinity site.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I went to the L Bar and Cafe,
where all the scientists

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
used to go, because it's
the only grocery in town.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Spoke to the people there--
Einstein and Oppenheimer

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.467 align:middle line:84%
went there often, and so they
even knew about the 1945 crash,

00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:90%
because they had to.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.633 align:middle line:90%
That was the only grocery store.

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It was the only bar.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It was the only place,
and people talk.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So if we had a crash
in '45, they knew.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And certainly if
we had a crash--

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and we did-- in
Roswell, they knew.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:84%
They know, and
they have to weigh

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.060 align:middle line:84%
whether to tell
the people or not.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you my
interesting Einstein story

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:90%
and joke.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein would
give a lot of speeches

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
all over the country, and
he was exhausted on one day,

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:84%
giving a speech, just
totally exhausted.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He had a driver who looked very
close to him, very similar.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he's sitting
in the back of his car,

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and he said, you know what?

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's do something
different tonight.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:90%
You be me, and I'll be you.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Nobody'll know the difference.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's just change clothes.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll put the driver's outfit
on, and I'll stand in the back

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.452 align:middle line:84%
and watch you dressed
up in my suit being me.

00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:84%
He says, Albert, do you
really want to do that?

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
I'm exhausted.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't give this speech.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:53.840 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
They changed clothes.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:90%
They got switched .

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The driver, playing the
part of Albert Einstein,

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:84%
went to the podium and
started talking about stuff.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And Albert Einstein,
dressed as the valet driver,

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:90%
stood in the back.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, they did
a little Q&A session,

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asked the
driver, Albert Einstein, sir,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:18.730 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us what you
meant by E equals MC square?

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And the driver looked at
the audience and said,

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.855 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the answer for you,
but my driver does in the back.

00:40:25.855 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's good.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was my
favorite Einstein story.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions from
the audience for Paola Harris

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about
the ET presence.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.495 align:middle line:90%
Yes, two people over there.

00:40:38.495 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, Paola.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Is there any reason why
people are reporting many UFO

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.040 align:middle line:84%
sightings over the Mayan
pyramids and the Giza pyramids,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and have you ever visited
any of those places

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.785 align:middle line:90%
and done research there?

00:40:50.785 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I've
been to Chichen Itza.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Teotihuacan.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Mexico City and
the Mayan ruins and so forth.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
we need to ask who

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:10.240 align:middle line:84%
those ancient
cultures really were.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:90%
The Incas disappeared.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The cultures were just
like the Egyptians.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They had culture
based on the stars.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.580 align:middle line:84%
They had navigation
systems based on the stars.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:90%
They had esoteric knowledge.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that whoever was
there, if you believe

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that we live in dimensions,
whoever was there never really

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.234 align:middle line:84%
They went into another
dimension, and they're there.

00:41:33.234 --> 00:41:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A portal.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: A portal, yeah.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So when we get amazing
photos of a light coming out

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of one of those artifacts,
one of those ancient sites,

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it may be either a
warning or a message,

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:90%
just like the crop circles.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It may be saying,
we're still here.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to you
in a different way.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Since I don't do
research in South America

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
because I can't speak
Spanish-- it would be hard.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to drag Heimi with me,
or some of the researchers--

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I am very curious.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.110 align:middle line:84%
That's an excellent
question, but I

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
do think that some of
the cultures, including

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.470 align:middle line:84%
the personage of Quetzalcoatl,
who was blond-haired,

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
blue-eyed, and came down on
some kind of flaming craft,

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:90%
could be ET related.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the technology to
build these structures where

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:30.580 align:middle line:84%
these UFOs are apparently being
seen is absolutely riveting.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
kind of technology

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to cut stones
like that, but they did.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They must have had some kind of
laser precision or something.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:84%
It was an advanced
culture, we know.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.189 align:middle line:84%
We know that the lines of Nazca
can't be seen on the earth.

00:42:49.189 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
look at it from above.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So let's
use logic here.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Logic is very important to know
that there were cultures that

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.172 align:middle line:84%
came from somewhere
else that did that.

00:43:00.172 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.352 align:middle line:84%
You had another
question back here.

00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, hello.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I was curious if John
Mack ever gave you insight

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:84%
into anything that
happened to him personally

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that caused him to change his
practice towards the field

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that you're studying-- anything
that may have made him convert

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.370 align:middle line:84%
from a belief
system to a knowing

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrial contact?

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.494 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what was
his catalyst, Paola?

00:43:31.494 --> 00:43:32.494 align:middle line:90%
What got him interested?

00:43:32.494 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This is
really interesting.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:84%
He used the word
knowing all the time,

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:84%
so I'm wondering
if John is here.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He might be.

00:43:40.205 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He used the
word knowing, just exactly

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.410 align:middle line:90%
the question that you gave me.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a knowing for
him, and what happened was,

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:84%
he had so many of these cases
that he couldn't ignore it.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And John was a very
compassionate person.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.580 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to listen.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to listen.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know of
any personal contact

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.590 align:middle line:84%
he had, but it's just
really curious you

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:90%
used the word a knowing.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Because in his last
lecture in Florence,

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:11.240 align:middle line:84%
he has that word at least
five times in his lecture.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.392 align:middle line:84%
He said, it is a
kind of knowing.

00:44:14.392 --> 00:44:16.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was one
of a kind, wasn't he?

00:44:16.226 --> 00:44:16.850 align:middle line:90%
You miss him?

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:17.891 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He was amazing.

00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because
of his method.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:90%
He was nonjudgmental.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.300 align:middle line:90%
He was compassionate.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.190 align:middle line:84%
He respected the
contactees, and he

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.215 align:middle line:84%
was willing to risk his
life and his career.

00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And he did.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His colleagues
scoffed at him.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.482 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:44:33.482 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
another question for Paola.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:35.990 align:middle line:90%
One more.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.302 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:44:37.302 --> 00:44:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Paola, in
doing your research,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
how do you distinguish whether
someone's just telling you

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.220 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of stories, that they
gave birth to a half-alien?

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we're hearing
more and more that

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.860 align:middle line:90%
they've integrated with us.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So how do you tell the
difference between someone

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that's just telling
you a story, and what

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.555 align:middle line:84%
is it that makes you
really believe them?

00:45:00.555 --> 00:45:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's a
really good question.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't do a lot of
contactee stories,

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.400 align:middle line:90%
because they're complicated.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:84%
What happens is there's a
progression with contactees

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.865 align:middle line:84%
that I have trouble
with, whether it

00:45:12.865 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
be Italian or French or
American or whatever.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:21.180 align:middle line:84%
What happens is they have the
contact, then they go public.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Then they become gurus,
and it becomes commercial.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that at the
crux of in between when they

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:84%
go public and become
commercial and so forth,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.070 align:middle line:90%
the aliens have gone home.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The aliens have said,
look, we've contacted you.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I think most of the contactees
that are real contactees

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about
it, because it's

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.830 align:middle line:90%
a very complicated situation.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The beings are contacting a
human being for a purpose,

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:51.410 align:middle line:84%
but not because they
necessarily have messages,

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
but because they want us
to grow up-- us to evolve.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of it
becomes commercial,

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and then it is not any
more a spiritual thing.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there's a lot of
spirituality in UFO research--

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.560 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you are interested
in a lot of things, aren't you?

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can tell.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
You are interested
in all of the part--

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.320 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual part, the
message part, and so forth.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of contact comes
when nobody talks about it.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that a
lot of the mission

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is to change the
world view, to change

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.490 align:middle line:84%
the way we deal with
each other first.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Because who's
going to come here?

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Just watch our television.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.880 align:middle line:84%
You think they're
interested in this?

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.546 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see
the movie The Abyss?

00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that movie.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I love
that movie, too.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:84%
What did they show
him on television?

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They showed him us.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.000 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing-- they
showed all kinds of stuff.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, they
actually save us

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.720 align:middle line:84%
because of one
act of love, which

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:84%
was his going down there to cut
the-- And what were we doing?

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.355 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
throw an atomic weapon

00:46:58.355 --> 00:47:01.890 align:middle line:90%
on their underwater base.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I think Cameron is a genius.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:03.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was great.

00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Cameron
just did Avatar.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's been
on our radio show.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.730 align:middle line:90%
He's just a super guy.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Isn't he amazing?

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember of
the big quotes in the movie

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.000 align:middle line:90%
The Abyss?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.377 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was a one-way trip.

00:47:12.377 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that changed the
complexity of the whole thing.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I think
aliens are interested in us

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because we have the capacity
to love that deeply-- to make

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.255 align:middle line:90%
sacrifices in war.

00:47:25.255 --> 00:47:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I think they have a collective
consciousness, where

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.213 align:middle line:84%
they do one thing that's
good for everybody,

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:32.710 align:middle line:84%
but we have free will,
so when we do something,

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.050 align:middle line:90%
it is an act of love.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.666 align:middle line:90%
And I love James Cameron.

00:47:37.666 --> 00:47:38.165 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:47:38.165 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of a kind.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come back with
Paola Harris, Beyond Belief.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.300 align:middle line:84%
She's going to show
us a few things.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.754 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.754 --> 00:47:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
to Beyond Belief.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
We're with the
investigator Paola Harris,

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:57.110 align:middle line:84%
as we're talking about
ET contact and UFOs.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.060 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, as you
know, I was the journalist

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:84%
who brought Colonel Philip
Corso to Italy twice to testify.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.970 align:middle line:90%
He didn't talk very much here.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So when he passed on
in 1998, his family

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.895 align:middle line:84%
gave me this, which
is his briefcase.

00:48:12.895 --> 00:48:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very worn.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But Colonel Corso came
to Italy with materials

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that we were able
to publish, like he

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.827 align:middle line:84%
had the autopsies of
the Roswell aliens.

00:48:23.827 --> 00:48:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:25.035 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:28.320 align:middle line:84%
He had his documents
of back engineering

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that he had worked
at the Pentagon.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.570 align:middle line:84%
He had those
documents, and also he

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
had a paper that he had written
about what extraterrestrials

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
would be telling us
about this planet.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And he would carry
them, and he'd always

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.574 align:middle line:90%
ask me, where's the briefcase?

00:48:45.574 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Where's the briefcase?

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, we got it, Colonel.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:49.340 align:middle line:90%
We got it.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.173 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is it?

00:48:50.173 --> 00:48:51.992 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This is it,
without the papers.

00:48:51.992 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they wouldn't
give me the papers.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:90%
But this is it, and so--

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The family
still has the papers.

00:48:55.705 --> 00:48:57.454 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The family
still has the papers.

00:48:57.454 --> 00:49:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have this with me all
the time, because Colonel

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Corso told me-- he said,
look, I won't be around.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.740 align:middle line:90%
He was 83.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:08.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wrote a book, The Day
After Roswell, with Bill Burns.

00:49:08.025 --> 00:49:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And we had
his personal papers,

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and we took his personal papers
and published them in Italy,

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:90%
called "The Dawn of a New Age."

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So when he told me he wouldn't
be around very much longer,

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.830 align:middle line:90%
he said, look you're a soldier.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.170 align:middle line:90%
You're a soldier.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You go there, and you
keep talking about it,

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:90%
even though I'm not here.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, the testimony
of Colonel Philip Corso

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
made me understand why
this secret was secret.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was the aliens.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought, everybody's afraid
of these people, or whatever.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The secret is about
the back engineering,

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.120 align:middle line:84%
the reverse engineering
that was done.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it was his
job to take those things

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.595 align:middle line:84%
to different companies,
corporations,

00:49:48.595 --> 00:49:51.450 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And he never told them
where they came from.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.278 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's right.

00:49:54.278 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He simply said,
can you duplicate this?

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.300 align:middle line:90%
We're testing you.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
There might be a big project
here for you, a government

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.210 align:middle line:90%
contract.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.860 align:middle line:90%
So we want you to analyze this.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And these were, what?

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Computer chips and
things like that?

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, they
were the microchip,

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.535 align:middle line:84%
the high-tenacity
fibers, fiber optics.

00:50:12.535 --> 00:50:17.900 align:middle line:84%
He said he grabbed these
lines, and they'd light up.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
was most fascinating--

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.020 align:middle line:84%
he said he had like, a piece
of rubber, which was actually

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.790 align:middle line:84%
the cover of the
being's eye, and he

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.341 align:middle line:84%
said he walked up and down
the halls of the Pentagon

00:50:29.341 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and they could see the
furniture at night.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, being proud
that he's in the army.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:33.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
like night vision?

00:50:33.625 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:90%
They developed night vision.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're kidding.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:84%
From that they developed
night-- he said, yeah.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It helped our
soldiers in Vietnam.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And then his last
words-- he said,

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:84%
we ignored the alien
body, which was

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.270 align:middle line:90%
the greatest gift they gave us.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.557 align:middle line:84%
And so, he said, I'm
trying to make up for it.

00:50:50.557 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
want to go on record

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and say the only
reason he came forth

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.080 align:middle line:90%
was for his three grandchildren.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:90%
He loved those three guys.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It took him a
long time, didn't it?

00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.364 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:50:59.364 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, the young
people can handle it.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.557 align:middle line:84%
And we brought his
grandchildren to Italy, too.

00:51:05.557 --> 00:51:06.890 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's the only reason.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:84%
People say that he did
it for other reasons.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:09.635 align:middle line:90%
That is not.

00:51:09.635 --> 00:51:12.430 align:middle line:90%
I was with him all that time.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:13.240 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I was very privileged,
as I was with Hynek.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.652 align:middle line:90%
And Colonel, I'll do a good job.

00:51:17.652 --> 00:51:18.610 align:middle line:90%
So what can I tell you?

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You carry it for him.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:20.313 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:51:20.313 --> 00:51:22.509 align:middle line:84%
I"ll do the best I can,
as objectively as I can.

00:51:22.509 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these little things

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.216 align:middle line:90%
that you've brought us here?

00:51:25.216 --> 00:51:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.983 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I touch this?

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That is a piece that
was given to me by Dr. Michael

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Wolf Kruvant.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a piece that was analyzed
at the University of Pisa.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.600 align:middle line:84%
He said it came from a
craft, and we analyzed it.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We put it through high
temperature and so forth.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It is 99% silicon, but it is a
silicon that is not made here.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a high-spike silicon, and
I have all the specs on that,

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.500 align:middle line:84%
because it was done
at the University.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I took it to
Europe to be analyzed.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you remember
the Arecibo reply?

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.404 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:52:08.404 --> 00:52:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We're made of carbon.

00:52:09.695 --> 00:52:11.075 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember the--

00:52:11.075 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.658 align:middle line:90%
They were made of this.

00:52:12.658 --> 00:52:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Silicon-based.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very interesting.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Where is this going to go, if we
have some courageous scientists

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that will step up to the plate
who will figure this out?

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:90%
This, instead, is amazing.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this thing?

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: James Fox and I went
on the Roswell debris field,

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and I think the Roswell
debris field is closed now.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:38.923 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Frank
Kimbler was with us.

00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:40.740 align:middle line:84%
He's a geologist who
lives in Roswell.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.993 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He thinks that's a
piece of the Roswell craft.

00:52:43.993 --> 00:52:45.330 align:middle line:90%
He cut it in half.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.890 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a piece to
have analyzed in Europe.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, he thinks
it's aluminum-based.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It's folded over,
as you can see.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.972 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a dead moth.

00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
folded-over metal.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's a geologist.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.090 align:middle line:84%
He said he's looked at it
already under his microscope,

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's been under high
pressure, high heat.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why he hasn't
had it analyzed in the United

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:84%
States is because it costs a
tremendous amount of money,

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you don't
get the piece back.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
you even find this?

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.311 align:middle line:90%
How big was the original piece?

00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, he's amazing.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We were on the
Roswell debris field.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
He has a very sensitive
Geiger-- the Geiger

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.290 align:middle line:90%
counter is on the field.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.540 align:middle line:90%
It goes off like crazy.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Then, he goes down and he
picks up what it points to.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's been on that
Roswell debris field forever.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.280 align:middle line:90%
This guy is real dedicated.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.992 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He just
combs it, doesn't he?

00:53:44.992 --> 00:53:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He combs it, because
he thinks that's a smoking gun.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:90%
He thinks that's a smoking gun.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:55.867 align:middle line:84%
James Fox, with whom I did the
trip, thinks a video of a UFO

00:53:55.867 --> 00:53:56.450 align:middle line:90%
is a smoking--

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is the smoking gun.

00:53:57.616 --> 00:53:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what he does.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And he's good at what he does.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:53:59.874 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:53:59.874 --> 00:54:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I think talking to an
alien is a smoking gun.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
a lot going on, Paola,

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and it comes right back to
the book of Genesis again

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and the interpretation
of just what that was

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I think if you read the book
of Genesis in the Bible--

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.350 align:middle line:84%
without being religious
here-- clearly,

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:24.320 align:middle line:84%
there was an event of some
kind of something, some beings,

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.840 align:middle line:84%
coming down from the
skies, from the heavens,

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.830 align:middle line:90%
doing whatever they did here.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:33.440 align:middle line:84%
You can interpret it one of two
ways, and one of two ways only.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's truly angelic
and extremely spiritual

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and sent from God, or they were
witnessing extraterrestrials

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:84%
coming down to the planet,
and in their little minds

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of the day, it was the only way
they could describe something

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.970 align:middle line:90%
in a godlike figure.

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:56.430 align:middle line:84%
If something came down and
I wasn't too well schooled

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
about it and they came
down from the skies,

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you'd think
about was-- these are gods!

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
has happened here.

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's one of these
two possibilities,

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and I tend to believe the
extraterrestrial presence.

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean I don't
believe in God.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I believe in God.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
being somewhere.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
trying to search out

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that same thing we're
all looking for.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular case,
I think we were visited,

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and it was recorded as such
as in the book of Genesis.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I tend
to agree with you,

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
testimonies from contactees

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that have talked to beings--
they believe in God, also,

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that there is a unifying force.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And whether you go to
science fiction or whatever,

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:43.464 align:middle line:90%
whatever force is out there--

00:55:43.464 --> 00:55:44.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There has to be.

00:55:44.505 --> 00:55:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Is going to create
more than one type of person

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.450 align:middle line:90%
or one creation.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.282 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's logical, yes.

00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was
just not an accident.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.040 align:middle line:84%
This is not a fluke of
nature, the mere fact

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're all here
doing this program.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.090 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a reason
behind it, and to me

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:06.360 align:middle line:90%
it's intelligence.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And intelligence means a
godlike, supernatural figure

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of some type.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what and how?

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't have those answers.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.377 align:middle line:90%
That's why I do what I do.

00:56:18.377 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:90%
But there's something out there.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I agree, George.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll
get to it, eventually.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.550 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:24.360 align:middle line:90%
What'd you bring us here?

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: OK, well,
when I do research,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.820 align:middle line:84%
apart from going on your show,
or I did the Sardinia research

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.110 align:middle line:84%
just recently, I don't
know where to put it.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I write for X Times
Magazine in Italy.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.100 align:middle line:90%
It's on the newsstand.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's
a slick magazine.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's your
website, Paola, for people?

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's www.paola--
because I'm Italian--

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paola--

00:56:47.417 --> 00:56:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Paolaharris.com.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:52.744 align:middle line:90%


00:56:52.744 --> 00:56:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Paolaharris.com.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And X Times is like
People magazine.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the
place in Italy.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:04.369 align:middle line:84%
And so news gets out there,
I think, more seriously.

00:57:04.369 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where to put it
here in the United States.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They think this
is what an ET looks like?

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In that
particular case,

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.130 align:middle line:84%
this is a UFO crash
at San Antonio.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So that went viral in Italy.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.530 align:middle line:90%
That went viral everywhere.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.969 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's one group.

00:57:20.969 --> 00:57:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good job, there.

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever check
out the UFO crash case

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and Cape Girardeau, Missouri?

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.045 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, but
I admire Ryan Wood.

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:29.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a huge case.

00:57:29.295 --> 00:57:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it was.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.820 align:middle line:84%
What I did check out was
Gulf Breeze in Florida.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:84%
My God, these people
come out in lawn chairs.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting
there, and they're

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.440 align:middle line:90%
seeing these craft come down.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And Steven Greer told
me a story about that,

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.860 align:middle line:84%
because he brought
his five people there.

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was, he got told,

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you have no right to do
this by the military.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, we
deal with that.

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You ordinary people
sitting here have no right

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.559 align:middle line:90%
to contact-- the enemy?

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.600 align:middle line:90%
ETs, or whatever.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But the Gulf Breeze case
really interested me also

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.550 align:middle line:84%
for the incredible
pictures, the photography.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's an example,
again, of somebody

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.010 align:middle line:90%
that went underground.

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.080 align:middle line:84%
The debunking that goes on
is our own people sometimes.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look out
five, 10 years from now.

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Where does this field of ufology
go, five, 10 years from now?

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If I'm
talking to you, we're

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:33.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about the
more spiritual, paranormal,

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.676 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric part
of this, because I'm

00:58:35.676 --> 00:58:36.800 align:middle line:90%
sick of the nuts and bolts.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We already know
the nuts and bolts.

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.830 align:middle line:90%
We have all these cases.

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.840 align:middle line:90%
We have all these sightings.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I think the conversation you and
I will have five years from now

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.710 align:middle line:90%
is on philosophy.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:48.290 align:middle line:84%
What does all this
mean for humanity?

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:49.998 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we have
disclosure by then?

00:58:49.998 --> 00:58:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Not by the
United States government.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.170 align:middle line:90%
They've got too much too lose.

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have to admit
that Roswell was real.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.780 align:middle line:90%
That's like saying lying.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.260 align:middle line:90%
NASA has to admit it.

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they have a
vested interest in keeping

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the technology
secret, and until we

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:10.150 align:middle line:84%
get past the New World view
that the oil and the gas

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and the fossil fuels--
which is an economic issue,

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.530 align:middle line:90%
it's not an alien issue.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to support everybody
that wants to do it.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be in
Washington with Stephen

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Bassett and the Citizen Hearing.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going on my own
dime to cover that,

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.960 align:middle line:90%
because it's a historical event.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The Disclosure Project
was a historical event.

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see Obama stepping
up to the plate and saying,

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.340 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, no president has.

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton tried
to get some answers,

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.720 align:middle line:84%
sending some aides out, and if
they came back with answers,

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.440 align:middle line:84%
he surely didn't
tell us about them.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
disclosure, either.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I think they think it'll
break down organization.

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:55.550 align:middle line:90%
It'll break down religions.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It'll break down
control, and like you

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.580 align:middle line:84%
said, they have to then
come up with the answer,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.630 align:middle line:84%
why didn't you tell
us this before?

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we're
going to find out

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is through people like you,
through people like astronaut

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell, and
those researchers who

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
have devoted their careers and
their lives to get this done,

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.250 align:middle line:90%
to keep doing what you're doing.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't give up.

01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.782 align:middle line:90%
I'm just getting old.

01:00:21.782 --> 01:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been at it for so
long, and it's a lonely job,

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
because you can't talk
to your family about it.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.260 align:middle line:90%
People don't take you seriously.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I've decided,
because I'm a teacher--

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not easy on
a date, either, is it?

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, do you
see me with anybody?

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.823 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You take a
guy out to dinner,

01:00:38.823 --> 01:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and you say, I
investigate ETs and UFOs.

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's OK
to talk about it,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.575 align:middle line:84%
but when you spend your money
on it, a significant other goes,

01:00:47.575 --> 01:00:50.604 align:middle line:84%
can't we go to the Caribbean
on vacation instead?

01:00:50.604 --> 01:00:51.895 align:middle line:90%
They'll say that automatically.

01:00:51.895 --> 01:00:54.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you'd prefer
to investigate a UFO.

01:00:54.037 --> 01:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I'm on
my way to Washington,

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
DC to cover something,
and that takes money.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
We need more like you.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for Paola
Harris, Beyond Belief.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Paola.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day-- one day,
we'll get the answers

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to this incredible question,
are we alone in the universe?

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
But I hope it's soon.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
