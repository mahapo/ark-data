00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:10%
Over the course of her
career, Dr. Toni Galardi

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
has worn 11
professional hats, all

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
as an offspring of her
original clinical training

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
as a Jungian-based
psychotherapist.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Now this led to her developing
courses, books, coaching,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
all devoted to helping people
find their soul's next purpose.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.207 align:middle line:90%
Toni, that's remarkable.

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:47.165 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TONI GALARDI: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to be here.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you don't stop.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:90%
What are you working on now?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.777 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: A new book.

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it called?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: "The
Lifequake Miracle--

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Awakening to Your True Purpose
in Times of Personal and Global

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Upheaval."

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there is a lot
of personal global upheaval

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:90%
these days isn't there?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
That title was actually
created last year

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.785 align:middle line:84%
because I knew it was
coming astrologically.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt it?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Oh, I could see it--

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%
the lineup.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.035 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been a tough time
for a lot of people hasn't it?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to warn people
for years this was coming.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it easy or
difficult to reach people

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to
get them into this mode?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: Most people
are afraid of change.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.635 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: So that's
why I developed this--

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:10%
30 years ago, I looked
at how to help people

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:10%
through what I call lifequakes.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And that title
came to me while I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
was in meditation because I was
going through my own lifequake.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone through
three different near fatal

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
All that I could see were due
to my not seeing the signs.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It was time to make a change.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And so I looked at what is it.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Why do we fear change?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I came up
with both with myself

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and most of the people
I've worked with and taught

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.072 align:middle line:84%
is change for most
people equals loss.

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
That's how they translate it.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talk about
you have worn 11 professional

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:90%
hats--

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.728 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we talking about?

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Well, I started out
as a licensed psychotherapist.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I have a PhD in psychology.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I went through
this massive awakening

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:90%
in my spirituality.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I had been trained neo-Freudian
and had been raised

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
in a Catholic Italian family.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:90%
My father was an immigrant.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And I went through this--

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I went through three
near-death experiences

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and realized something
needed to change in my life.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.833 align:middle line:84%
And so I stopped practicing,
and I became a talk show host.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just stopped?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.402 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I sold my
practice, left my marriage.

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:52.235 align:middle line:90%
There was a number--

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went through
all kinds of changes.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.205 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Sold my home and went
into a quiet meditative

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.345 align:middle line:90%
period of my life.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For how long?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: The beginning
of it was about a year.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I just took a room in
someone's house in Los Angeles,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
moved from Orange County to
LA and would go and do my show

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.992 align:middle line:90%
because I was interview--

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
by how do people

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
move from doing one thing
that was secure to something

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:90%
else brand new.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
interviewing pioneers,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
people who had left
behind secure jobs

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:90%
to create something brand new.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was fascinated by this.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And while I was
doing the talk show,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I was just spending the rest
of the time in quiet meditation

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
until the seven stage
model came literally

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
through my meditation, called
the lifequake repurposing

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
method.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
interviewing these people,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Toni, for yourself or for them?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I think
initially it was

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
for me to get inspiration
because I didn't know

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:90%
what I was going to do next.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew that people had
told me I was telegenic.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I was-- looked
great on television,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
but what I really cared about
was teaching and coaching

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and reaching people.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I stopped practicing
because I-- the only model

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew was the long-term
therapy model for helping

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.357 align:middle line:90%
people move through change.

00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now in addition to all
of this, you're an astrologer.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: In a very
weird way, George.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I was at a party,
and someone said, oh,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
did you know that the best kept
secret in corporate America

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and politics is they all have
an astrologer on retainer.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.358 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: And I said really?

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:32.775 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
so fascinating.

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought this would
be an amazing show.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I have this guy, a
guy who's done this on the show.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So through friends I found
this guy Steven Levine,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and he said I'll do your
show on one condition,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:90%
if you do-- let me do your chart

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I said fine.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I've never had an
astrology chart done.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And he started telling me
things that you would never

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.202 align:middle line:84%
know from looking at me on
camera because I look like--

00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:56.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But only
you would know.

00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Only I would know.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Told me I was
really an introvert

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
because I look like such
an extrovert on camera

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.107 align:middle line:90%
and which is absolutely true.

00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
He told me I was
going to write books.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He told me I was going
to be a pioneer myself

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
in the field of something.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.725 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know what it was then.

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:13.833 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did
you accept that?

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: I started--

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or did it
sound way out there?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: At the
time, I was dubious.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I was not one of those people
who had made charts by hand

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and gone through.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I came into astrology when there
were already software programs.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But the first time I sat down
and actually put someone--

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:84%
someone gave me a software
program for astrology.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It was like a natural for me.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I just came to it naturally.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Years later, I went and had a--

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
after I started--
what I did was I just

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
started working with
clients slowly because I

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.118 align:middle line:90%
had learned about shamanism.

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:50.285 align:middle line:84%
I had been going through
this massive restructuring.

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, you went through
a metamorphosis didn't you?

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Total metamorphosis.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And went to Peru
trained as a shaman.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Went through a massive
shamanic initiation, which

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:90%
means total ego purification.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything was stripped away in
my life, my health, everything.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And astrology started
giving me answers.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I started learning about how to
help myself on a health level

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
through medical astrology.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Relationship astrology
helped me with relationships

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and helping other people.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
So it had all these answers.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to see a Vedic
astrologer because I thought,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe a Vedic astrologer--
because they come from India--

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
would have a different take
on my chart because it was--

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I was going through so
much change and loss.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.495 align:middle line:84%
And he said you were
born to be an astrologer.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
He said-- when I
looked at your chart--

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and this guy had
advised the Maharishi.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
He said when I
looked at your chart

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.386 align:middle line:90%
I said why is she seeing me.

00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
She's a bona fide astrologer.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he said
something that was like--

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:90%
to me like gold.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
He said you are here to burn
all your karma because you

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:84%
will experience
enlightenment before you die.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was like that was--
that's all I cared about.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:90%
That was the message.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Toni, astrologer Monte
Farber on "Open Minds"

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
talked about the different
types of astrology.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MONTE FARBER: I do not
believe in living your life

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:10%
by astrology or anything because
I'm a big free will person.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:10%
Once again--

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
But it can give you

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:10%
just certain potentials and
attributes that you can likely

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.742 align:middle line:10%
use or choose or not choose.

00:07:24.742 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Like what you were
saying about electricity

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.015 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.668 align:middle line:84%
It shows you the potentials
of where you're flowing.

00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But you can't look
at someone's chart

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and say this person is a genius
or this person is unfortunately

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:90%
in a mental institution.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
how you can tell

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
from astrology what
level someone's operating

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:90%
their chart on.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.083 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that good.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anyone is that good.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.208 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well and
also you just talked

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
about reconciling
these various factors.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to reconcile also
that there's Vedic astrology.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Now Vedic astrology shifts
the chart to the extent that

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.578 align:middle line:84%
you're almost an entire
sign behind what you're--

00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:02.495 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because they
use the constellations.

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, Western
astrology says and some people

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:90%
love Vedic astrology.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Some people love Western.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Then you have Chinese--

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese astrology--
the Chinese horoscope.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's different as well.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have chosen
Western astrology why?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's what I learned
at first, and it seems to work.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
mess up my brain.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.885 align:middle line:84%
It's why I stay
away from numerology

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because there are versions
of the numbers are

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
different from what
astrology teaches.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:10%
I have friends who
are numerologists

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:10%
who do very accurate stuff.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
I think once again coming
back to the Sabbath being

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
made for man, not
man for the Sabbath,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:90%
I feel that it's in us.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
The magic is in us.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The magic's not
in the magic wand.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.660 align:middle line:10%
My cards are just not the--

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: These are
little guide stones,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.015 align:middle line:10%
but your intuition is innate.

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Toni?

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: So couple of things.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe that by using
astrology and numerology,

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:90%
I see the soul contract.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I see the repetitive themes.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The numerology and--
I over and over

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
again see that there's
a theme, and that's

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
why I call it a soul
blueprint reading.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I also believe that intuition
is what you bring to it.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's what allows
you to look at a chart--

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
like I have five planets
in the house of the mystic.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It's also the house of prisons.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're trapped right?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So you either
are a person who's

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
meant to surrender to the
divine and be guided and led

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
as a mystic, or you're
a person who ends up

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
doing some nefarious things
and ends up in prison

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.938 align:middle line:90%
that keeps you in retreat.

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there have
been people who've

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.355 align:middle line:84%
gone through major
transformations in prison.

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:39.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's either or.

00:09:39.648 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: It's pretty extreme.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a huge
prisoner listenership

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:90%
to our radio show.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Do you?

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I get
letters from prisoners,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
a transformation.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: They can.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty dramatic.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:90%
What is medical astrology?

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: So it's--

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had doctors who couldn't
figure out certain patients

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
consult me because
when I first got sick,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I had the kind of illness that
nobody could quite figure out.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was a virus,
a chronic virus,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
so I've been studying
viruses for many years.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So medical astrology
looks at a chart

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and sees where the
physical weaknesses

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
are you come in with.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So there are-- so
whenever I do any reading,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I will always give
someone here's

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
where you need to strengthen.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Like somebody who's a
Capricorn, for example,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
needs actually more magnesium
and calcium and vitamin D

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.405 align:middle line:90%
than your average bear.

00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:33.597 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Someone who's a
Gemini needs to pay attention

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:90%
to their nervous system.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.712 align:middle line:84%
They need to really
make sure they're

00:10:38.712 --> 00:10:42.382 align:middle line:84%
nourishing their nervous system
because they're very mental.

00:10:42.382 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's interesting
that you take that approach.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you still practice
psychotherapy?

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: It's combined.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.388 align:middle line:84%
It's-- I have that
toolbox when I'm doing--

00:10:52.388 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
when I'm working with
someone in career coaching.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But my specific
passion is helping

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
people master the
fear of change,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
find what they're here
to do, and then become

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.533 align:middle line:90%
an agent of change in the world.

00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm committed to that.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people, Toni,
are just literally screwed up?

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:08.628 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I don't see
it that way, George.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: I don't.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I think that--

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm blunt.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: People come
in with karmic blockages,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and there are people who go
from extreme poverty, no father,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Like a Steve Harvey I was
talking to the limousine driver

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
about him--

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
came from nothing, lived
in his car for three years.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Dramatic.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.275 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: To become a comedian.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:34.075 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And look at him now.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Yeah, you can
transcend what you were given.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:90%
There's no question.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can come from
damaged childhoods--

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
having worked with people who've
come from damaged childhoods

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and helped them--

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
addicts and whatever-- I don't
work with chronic illnesses

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
anymore, but I have
the training in order

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:90%
to know who to refer people to.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This term that
you've coined, lifequakes--

00:11:58.375 --> 00:11:59.175 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:02.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ties into
earthquakes I guess right?

00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Well, the way
that I see it is that it's--

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
because I practice
evolutionary astrology,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
it's not faith based.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about helping
the person evolve.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I-- when
lifequake came to me,

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
it was about taking
these things called

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
crisis-driven transitions
and seeing them as a rebirth.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Marx Hubbard
was the very first guest

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I had on my show and my
first spiritual mentor.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things she said was

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.463 align:middle line:84%
that when-- she had five
children before she found

00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
her calling, before
she became one

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of the pioneers of the
human potential movement.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So-- and she became
involved with Jonas Salk,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and that led to her
leaving her marriage.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But she said when she had a
child, when she was in labor--

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I never forgot this--

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
she said if I didn't know--
she said to the doctor--

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't know I
was having a baby,

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I would have
thought I was dying.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens when
you go through a lifequake.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.992 align:middle line:84%
It-- your whole
life gets shaken up.

00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:03.325 align:middle line:90%
It could come through a divorce.

00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It can come through
losing your job.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It can come through an illness.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But with a roadmap,
which is what I have,

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is a seven stage roadmap of
what to do at the body, mind,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and spirit in each stage of
this process of lifequake.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And so with people
having a map, it

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
allows them to feel
more secure that there's

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
a structure for
them when they're

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in the unknown, when they
don't know what's next,

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.085 align:middle line:90%
when they've lost everything.

00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:32.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many lifequakes
can people handle?

00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:33.418 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Several
in a lifetime.

00:13:33.418 --> 00:13:34.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a lifetime.

00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:35.205 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Several.

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It's how you do it.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.085 align:middle line:84%
I don't do lifequakes
the way I used to.

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: It means
that I used to go

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
through near fatal experiences
before I made changes.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
The very first job
that I had on Skid Row,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I got a feeling in my gut we
needed to get a security guard.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I told my boss, and
he didn't listen.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And a guy got through
screening, he was high on PCP,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.012 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to strangle me
to death in the workplace.

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
been through a lot.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: But I didn't
listen to my gut that

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
was saying leave
the job because I

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to depend on my then
fiance who became my husband.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first
near fatal experience

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't listen to my gut.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The second was my
marriage, and I

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.057 align:middle line:84%
was in three car accidents
in a six-day period.

00:14:23.057 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three car accidents?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: And the
third accident, I

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:90%
wasn't even driving.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I was in the backseat.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Each time we were
pushed from behind.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So I've written about
how car accidents are

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
symbolic of the kind of
change you need to be making.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
I was being told move on.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Move on.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I had
made this commitment.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I was raised a Catholic.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:90%
You make a vow.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
You keep a vow.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
stay in my marriage.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it was
like the game changer.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a conference,
a transpersonal conference,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
walked into a workshop, and
walked out a different person.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
we listen to our gut?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Some people?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.603 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: Because if you have
especially-- there are people--

00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed
people for this book

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:10%
because I have 15 thought
influencers plus hundreds

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:10%
of interviews from
clients and whatnot

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:10%
before I wrote this book.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
over and over again

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
is people are afraid of
change because they fear loss.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Their first chakra, as we
look at the etheric body,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
may be damaged through
having experienced

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:90%
tremendous loss as a child.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:90%
My father was a gambler.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
He was an engineer by day, an
Italian raised in Brooklyn,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
and this is what they did.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So security was a
big issue for me

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
because our economics
would go up and down.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's true for
a lot of people.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed Martin Rutte.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.105 align:middle line:10%
He didn't go
through any of that.

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:10%
He wrote "Project Heaven
on Earth," which I think--

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.573 align:middle line:10%
he's going to become the Nobel
Peace winner in a few years.

00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have to go
through a lifequake

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
in a dramatic
horrific kind of way.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
He decided he
didn't want to be--

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't fun anymore for him
being a corporate consultant.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So he went into retreat,
went away for six months,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
took the financial loss,
went to-- he's Jewish--

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.928 align:middle line:84%
went to an Augustinian
monastery, went into retreat--

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, he
changed everything--

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: And was
told in his meditation

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that you need to bring
God into the workplace.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he did this thing that
nobody was doing in 1989.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
He started talking about
God in the workplace.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.335 align:middle line:84%
He called it beingness
in the workplace.

00:16:28.335 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Toni, why do people
make these evolutionary changes

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:90%
in their life?

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Pretty dramatic as
you've been pointing out.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do this?

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Because we're part
of a collective energy that

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is going through a massive
spiritual transition.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%
That's why I took--

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I modeled this from the
micro to the individual

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to the macro, which is we're
in a global lifequake as well.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In
astrology, astrologers

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
use planetary alignments quite a
bit to tell us about ourselves.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: That's right.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do these planets
have so much to do with who

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
we are and what we are?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Because there are--
we are a part of a galaxy.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we are at the effect
of planetary energies

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So based on what
the degrees are--

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
it's very mathematical
in astrology.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.936 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a
chart, you can predict--

00:17:19.936 --> 00:17:22.394 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I was-- why I
became passionate about using

00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:24.632 align:middle line:84%
it as one of the tools
for change management--

00:17:24.632 --> 00:17:25.799 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a good idea.

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Because I saw
that I could help people

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
prepare where they didn't
have to get hit over the head

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that they could start
to see the signs.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
There are two stages
of my model that

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.827 align:middle line:84%
are before the crisis
hits if you pay attention.

00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was
going to just say

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.285 align:middle line:90%
do people listen to you?

00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: When
they come to me--

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:90%
if they come to me.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, they come to
me when their hair is on fire.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a big
stage for them isn't it?

00:17:50.557 --> 00:17:51.405 align:middle line:90%
By that time?

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Right.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they panicking?

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Typically.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
But I have helped people.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I've prepared them.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.888 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
have come to me just

00:17:58.888 --> 00:18:01.935 align:middle line:84%
for a reading in which I've
said in about six months there's

00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be massive change.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Start rearranging your world.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Start saving your money.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Start reorganizing your work.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
One month before everything
shut down in March,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
a woman came to me who
owns airport parking lots--

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
before everything shut down.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:90%
She was miserable.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Owned-- was sitting on
properties were $30 million

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
but was miserable and said I
really want to be an artist.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Then things started-- we had
this panic and a pandemic that

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
started happening.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And she went from 150 cars
in a parking lot to five.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Overnight.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.867 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Overnight
because airports, of course.

00:18:40.867 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody's driving.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Right.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we had to
start working on--

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.120 align:middle line:84%
but she still didn't
want to let go.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
She was offered a certain
amount of money for the parking

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and her partner said,
no, let's just wait.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to her
sell this summer.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get out.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Sell this summer.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this week that's
what she's doing.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she did well?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And she can become
an artist now--

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: That's right.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And be
fine-- and be happy.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: And be happy.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come there are
so many miserable people

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:90%
out there, though, Toni?

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Because they don't
know another way, George.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
When you are aligned
with your purpose, when

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
you are living your
purpose, you are

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
passionate and
joyous and healthy.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we see this
time and time again don't we?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: It's an inside job.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you can
teach people to be happy?

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Absolutely.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But in my version of it,
my corner of that world

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.615 align:middle line:84%
is about helping people
find their soul's purpose.

00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned earlier charts.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The astrologer
Heather Arielle talked with me

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%
about these event charts.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.168 align:middle line:10%
You also looked at the chart of
that disaster in the Ukraine.

00:19:51.168 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:10%
>>HEATHER ARIELLE: Right.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.207 align:middle line:10%
The Ukraine-- the Ukraine-

00:19:53.207 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Train that went--
plane that went down.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: The
Ukraine air disaster,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:10%
I study accident
charts a lot, and this

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:10%
is called an event chart.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So any time something like that
happens, it's an event chart,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and you put it together.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in a flight chart,
Uranus rules flight,

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
so you always want
to look at Uranus

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and make sure you want to
have nice harmonious aspects.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Mars is critical in
any accident chart.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Mars is violence.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And then Uranus,
that's explosive.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So Mars and Uranus working
together because Uranus

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
rules technology, you have the
energy to successfully maneuver

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.370 align:middle line:90%
the technology.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
In hard aspects, it's the
classic accident aspect,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
and it can have explosions.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a lot going
on in this accident chart,

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.253 align:middle line:84%
and it's also you have to say,
well, in the sky that day,

00:20:42.253 --> 00:20:44.295 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of planes
that took off that day.

00:20:44.295 --> 00:20:44.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every day.

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, every day.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And the day that this
accident happened,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
there were lots of
planes that took off,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and every plane that took off
this day had an afflicted Mars.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Mars was incredibly afflicted.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:90%
It was opposing Uranus--

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could have
happened to any of them?

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It was--
well, I'll tell you

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
why it happened to this one.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:10%
It could-- it does create
more incendiary-- in general,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:10%
it does create a
higher potential,

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:10%
but it is activated
by the specific time

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:10%
because it depends on the
houses, where they are.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:10%
So in this case and Mars
were square in the sun,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:10%
what happened is
that Mars ended up

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:10%
at the top of the chart,
the most public place,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:10%
conjunct a prenatal
eclipse and a north node,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:10%
and the north node is the
destiny of the flight.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't want the
destiny of your flight

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to be public because
that means something's

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to it, that
it's going to be in the news.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Mars was square in the sun
the health of the flight

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:90%
in the house of death.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Opposing Uranus in
the fourth house

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
is very significant
in accident charts

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.053 align:middle line:84%
because that represents
the end of the matter.

00:21:49.053 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
did you look at?

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:90%
The flight number?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you pick that plane?

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh!

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:90%
No, well, you have to go--

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:84%
you have to go-- you have
to make a chart of the time

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that they took off because
the time that they took off

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:90%
sets everything into motion.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have to
have that specific flight?

00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.743 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, you have
to have that specific--

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
it was 6:15 PM when they were
sched-- when they actually

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:90%
took off.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- and
the moon was in Aries.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Mars was very active,
Moon and Aries

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
because Mars rules Aries,
applying to Uranus,

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and so it was explosive
qualities all over the chart.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
timing, they all

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:90%
ended up on the wrong angles.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
it was this time.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though other flights--
because if they're

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
in other houses, that
could just mean, oh,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
there could have been an
altercation on a flight,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.403 align:middle line:84%
or that could have been
a day when there was

00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.935 align:middle line:84%
a lot of turbulence and that
there could have been there

00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
could have-- it would have been
represented on all the flights,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:84%
but not as in a
catastrophic explosion.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
That is because of the
timing and the angles.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now she was using a
lot of astrological jargon.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.115 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what she was saying?

00:23:00.115 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So Mars-Uranus
conjunctions try and--

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
they've studied this
with earthquakes.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
That is the most common aspect
when Mars and Uranus come

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
together for earthquakes, and
it doesn't even matter rather.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's trines, sextiles,
squares or oppositions.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The-- what I would add to that
as it applies to something like

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
this is the destiny of the
people on that particular plane

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.907 align:middle line:84%
versus people who were
on a different plane--

00:23:25.907 --> 00:23:26.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Individual?

00:23:26.065 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: On that day.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
On that day.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to do
charts on all those individuals

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that were on that
fatal plane crash,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
would you have
seen something bad?

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I think enough
people who had certain afflicted

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:90%
aspects to their chart--

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
because what we do know is that,
for example, with 9/11, 20%--

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
often 20% of a
plane on the day--

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
when a flight goes
down, 20% of people

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.508 align:middle line:84%
have opted not to
take a flight, changed

00:23:55.508 --> 00:23:56.758 align:middle line:90%
their mind at the last minute.

00:23:56.758 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For some
reason, they sense

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.322 align:middle line:90%
happened with highly unusual.

00:23:58.322 --> 00:24:00.197 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: That's what
happened with United--

00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, with the United 93, 20%
of people change their mind.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't know why.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a gut.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.408 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Their gut.

00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
wake up in the morning,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
go I think this
plane's going down

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
or something's going to happen.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.595 align:middle line:84%
They just feel uneasy
I guess don't they.

00:24:14.595 --> 00:24:17.095 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: And they know also
that that's not their destiny.

00:24:17.095 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
how these alignments

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
have something to do with
what's happening in our lives.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So what
I like to study

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
besides the personal
on the macro level

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
because it affects the
whole world, not just

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
one group of people,
is our eclipses.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:90%
When we look at eclipses--

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Solar and lunar?

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Solar and lunar.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the natal
positions of eclipses,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, Prince William
was born under a solar eclipse,

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and what is-- he's
already taking

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:90%
on mental health in England.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be
an incredible king.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
People born on lunar eclipses,
if they achieve fame--

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.573 align:middle line:84%
and we do see this often that
there's leaders great leaders

00:25:02.573 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
are born on eclipses--

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should everybody
get an astrological chart

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:90%
done on themselves?

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: If they feel
that intuitively it

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
can help, especially in
a time of transition.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling lost,
if you're feeling--

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
or you're having a
health crisis or you keep

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.778 align:middle line:84%
having relationship
problems and you're

00:25:20.778 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:90%
choosing the wrong kind--

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I've helped people find the
right mate through astrology.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really!

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a guest
who appears on my radio show

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:90%
quite often.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
She's a numerologist,
Glynis McCants.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
She found her husband
through numerology.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Just rejected like 20 of them,
got one that looked good,

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and they're still married.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be happy.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I
personally just find

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
what astrology and
numerology gives

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
me is helping guiding
people through lifequakes.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:90%
It gives them how long.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
There's someone who
for quite recently

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:84%
decided he would take
the term lifequakes

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and make it his own around
crisis-driven transitions,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and he said on all
the major talk shows

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.665 align:middle line:84%
that this caught-- that these
lifequakes last five years.

00:26:11.665 --> 00:26:12.465 align:middle line:90%
That's ludicrous.

00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:13.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:14.072 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.864 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: First of
all, he's a journalist.

00:26:15.864 --> 00:26:18.125 align:middle line:84%
He's not an astrologer
or a psychotherapist,

00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
but he said everyone
is going to--

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:90%
that's just not true.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Some people take a year.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Some people take five years.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.552 align:middle line:84%
There have been people
who, because they're

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
afraid of change, will stay
in a lifequake for 10 years.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's all individual that you see
through someone's natal chart

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.482 align:middle line:84%
and their desire for
change that they really

00:26:35.482 --> 00:26:36.565 align:middle line:90%
want to change their life.

00:26:36.565 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Astrologer and
psychotherapist Sandra Leigh

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
appeared with me on
one of our programs.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:90%
She talks about astrology.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDRA LEIGH:
Someone is a seeker,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:10%
and they have a little
bit of awareness.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:10%
They can see.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Like I get women who choose
the same type of relationship

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:10%
that is very bad for them.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But if they have the awareness
of why they're choosing it,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
so that's where your
psychology comes in.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Why are you choosing
someone like that?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Then they're better able
once they have the knowledge

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.325 align:middle line:84%
to make a better decision and
to recognize their patterns.

00:27:09.325 --> 00:27:11.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they can't
alter their future?

00:27:11.335 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEIGH: I believe you
can alter your future,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:90%
but I have to be honest.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Very few people do.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I think you need to meditate.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I think you need to do
spiritual disciplines.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I think there's things
that would help you make

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.620 align:middle line:90%
better choices in your life.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And also, again, the
awareness, the knowledge,

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and the information is going to
help you make better choices.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you say very
few people change their future,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
is it because they
don't know how,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.375 align:middle line:90%
or they just don't want to?

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEIGH: Well, the consciousness
isn't raised enough.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:90%
I feel they're not--

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
they don't have that
within them to see

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
where they're making
mistakes or where

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:84%
some-- they don't see the
consequences necessarily

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.117 align:middle line:90%
of their actions.

00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's harder, George,
when you're younger because I

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
don't think you care as much.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:84%
You have that kind of
devil may care attitude

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:90%
most people when they're young.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I think wisdom comes
in for a lot of people

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
when they're older.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandra, how do you
really change your destiny?

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Whether you look at an
astrological chart or not,

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
how do people step in and say
I'm going to change my future?

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LEIGH: Well, I
think a lot of it

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is people are very determined
and they don't give up.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't recognize
failure in their life.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:90%
They just keep going.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand, there

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:90%
is a destiny aspect to it.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like a dog on a chain--

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:90%
on a leash.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And within that realm, the dog
does have free will, how far

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:90%
he or she can move within that.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.300 align:middle line:90%
But they're limited.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like you take
these prodigies.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's say Elton
John was playing

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the piano when he was four years
old, but I wasn't doing that.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have the
innate talent to do that.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
That's part of destiny about
where your talents are.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to change
it, you have to work at it.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You gotta say, well, I don't
want to be that person.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
you can change it,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
but not enough people
apply themselves.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I think that if you
work at something long enough,

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
you can get very good at it,
but as you know there's a lot

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%
of talented people in our world.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
You watch some of these shows
that put amateur singers on

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're incredibly talented
but they're not famous.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The difference is the
astrological chart.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The difference is their destiny
at this point and also the fact

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that they see
themselves that way.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of very famous people
when they were very young

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
really knew inside
that they were

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be famous because
they knew they were going

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:90%
to be a star in some ways.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that chart
really change your life

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.975 align:middle line:84%
that much, your
career, your path?

00:29:44.975 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I think that
what I-- where I disagree--

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
because this is
several years old--

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is that where there's a
spiritual quickening taking

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
place on the planet, so
more people are waking up.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So what used to be just karma
that we saw in a natal chart,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that people were
destined to, is changing

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of the entire
collective consciousness

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
What she said about young people
is actually not true anymore.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The "New York Times," the "LA
Times," and the "New Yorker"

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:84%
have done articles on the
Millennials' new religion,

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.825 align:middle line:90%
So they are really--

00:30:20.825 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:84%
the young people are
turning to astrology.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
They see that it can be
a guiding force for them.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With astrology,
people do a lot of it

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
for their own health
purposes, too.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yes.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can astrology tell
you whether you're sick or not?

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: It can help to
diagnose what the illness is.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.525 align:middle line:90%
It can show you--

00:30:41.525 --> 00:30:42.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What it might be?

00:30:42.703 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Yeah,
for example, when

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:84%
there are Neptune
transits happening,

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
it can be misdiagnosed.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It can be very
unclear for the doctor

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:90%
as to what exactly is going on.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what astrology
can do is it can actually

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.095 align:middle line:84%
point to something
going on, for example,

00:31:01.095 --> 00:31:03.095 align:middle line:84%
in the immune system,
that that's what's driving

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:90%
it is the immune system.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
strengthen the immune system,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and then the symptoms
will go away.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with me actually.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:90%
No one could help me.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened when
I became in-- my house became

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:90%
infected with mold.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:84%
That was my third near fatal
experience was I was dying.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:90%
No one knew.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I went from doctor to doctor.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew how to help me.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the transit
was happening,

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and I thought
Neptune, there's got

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to be something to do
with water, something

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:90%
to do with water.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to
my acupuncturist

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been noticing
these little gray spots

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in my linoleum in
my kitchen, and she

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.660 align:middle line:90%
said I think it's geopathic.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I called out an
environmental consultant.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:90%
He punched the walls.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, honey,
this is black mold.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Dangerous.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Stachybotrys
chartarum, this

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
is the deadliest
mold on the planet.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
He said you have
to get out of here.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has astrology
changed your life, Toni?

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Oh,
it's saved my life.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you weren't a
practitioner of astrology,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.895 align:middle line:84%
would you have still
stumbled into it somehow?

00:32:07.895 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I think
it was my destiny.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:84%
If you had said that to me at
20, I would have said no way.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: No way.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I studied charts for
years just when I went back

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.402 align:middle line:84%
into practice 'cause I was
using shamanism to clear

00:32:21.402 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:90%
people's emotional blockage--

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anyway right.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Already.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I just started just
looking at charts.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I would ask my clients
for their birth date

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and if they had
the time of birth,

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to see
if there was real data.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So I collected enough
empirical information

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:90%
before I was a believer.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can you say now
that beyond a shadow of a doubt

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
astrology can change
somebody's life?

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Without a doubt.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just knowing.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You can give someone a
reading as to what's going on

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or where their talents
lie and guide them

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:84%
into something that they
should be doing, for example.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But where the other
piece of my work,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
which is the lifequake
repurposing model comes in,

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is giving them the
tools step by step

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
based on what stage of
their lifequake they're in,

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and that helps the individual
along with the astrology chart

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to structure how
to move forward.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't they
do this on their own?

00:33:21.785 --> 00:33:22.702 align:middle line:90%
Why do they need help?

00:33:22.702 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: Most
people's intuition

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:10%
is pretty blocked
because we live

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:10%
in a very analytical society.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:10%
If you're highly intuitive, you
don't need astrology actually.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Toni, Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It's been really fun to be here.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I learned a
lot about astrology.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:10%
And it can really
change your life.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
