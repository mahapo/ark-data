people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%

>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%

was watching me.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that I truly enjoy

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:10%
about this program, the topics,
the subject matter, and very

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:10%
special guests who bring us just
some riveting programming that

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:10%
makes you just sit
back and think.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have that
with Olav Phillips.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:90%
He's a conspiracy researcher.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be talking
about a topic tonight that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
is dear to my heart, mysterious
and lost civilization.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Olav, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAV PHILLIPS: Well,
thanks for having me.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.161 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is exciting
work that you do.

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.965 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: I researched
things, and one day I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.917 align:middle line:10%
was doing some research, and
I came across a reference

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:10%
to something called
the East Bay Wall.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And the East Bay Wall is
not far from where I live.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:10%
I've lived in the Bay
Area for most of my life.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never heard of it.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, well,
I've never heard of this.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be a big deal.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to
figure what it is.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.526 align:middle line:84%
So I started to do
research about it.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you did
a lot of research.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I did
a lot of research.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And some of it, there are things
about it that are exciting,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and there things about
it that bother me.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell us a little
bit about what this area is

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and what you were
able to discover.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.218 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So the initial thing
that I figured out

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
was that there's a wall
that runs roughly from San

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Jose to the Carquinez Strait.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.727 align:middle line:84%
It's been reported on a
few times, but not really.

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:54.143 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the Great Wall
of China, that kind of thing?

00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, kind of.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
In most places, it's about
three to four feet high.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
It's about a foot across.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we found out later it
runs about three to four feet

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:90%
deep into the dirt.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty old.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
where it came from.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Conventionally, people think
that an Amish farmer built it,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
that, I don't know.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They can't figure
how who built it.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of that mystery
is what attracted me to it.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
People had talked
about it now and again.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But I had never heard
of it, so, you know.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.304 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of material?

00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It's loose rock.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
The rocks are about
this big in size,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're just basically
stacked together into a wall.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
are the dimensions?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: In most places it's
about three to four feet high

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and about a foot across.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But in some places it can
go up to seven feet high.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've discovered
that it does indeed--

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how long?

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The initial
chunk was about 50 miles.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50 miles?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.423 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, and
it's broken in places.

00:03:01.423 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were they
trying to keep out?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.563 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, that's
one of the big questions.

00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:90%
The whole wall thing excited me.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I studied archaeology.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I studied anthropology
when I was in school.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.185 align:middle line:84%
And so mysterious old
things, I like that.

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But nobody had
ever done any kind

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.213 align:middle line:84%
of archaeological research,
and that bothered me,

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:23.296 align:middle line:84%
that we have this wall
that nobody in the Bay Area

00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:90%
has ever heard of.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Its 50 miles long,
which is ridiculous.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And it just sits there.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows why it
was built. Nobody

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
knows exactly who built it.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows exactly
when built it,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
because nobody ever dated it.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just sat there.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
even that it exists.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans in our
area around the Bay Area,

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
they didn't build
monumental structures.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They didn't build structures
out of stone or out

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of-- they lived in small kind
of movable houses, so to speak.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:90%
And they were quasi-nomadic.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So building a 50-mile
long wall is kind of

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:90%
beyond what they would do.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some believe that
maybe the Spanish might

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:90%
have built this?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The
Spanish, some people

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
talked about the Spanish.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that when the
Spanish arrived in our area,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.904 align:middle line:84%
they actually reported the
wall having already been there.

00:04:15.904 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't have
built it because--

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it couldn't
have been them.

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.934 align:middle line:84%
See, this is where
it gets mysterious.

00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the Native
Americans didn't build it,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.391 align:middle line:84%
the Spanish didn't
build it, who did?

00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody takes claim.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Nobody
takes claim to it, no.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
There is some weird-- as
you expand out from it,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
you kind of jettison this
notion that there's one wall.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to look in
the entire environment of all

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of northern California, then you
start to understand more things

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are more
legends about the walls

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and about the structures that
are associated with the walls.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%
The wall itself, yeah, no.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say,
Olav, is it possible that there

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
are other things there
that may be buried?

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It is possible.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
As I said, no large-scale
archaeological expedition

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:90%
has ever been carried out.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Recently I've been contacted
by some people that

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
are interested in possibly
doing that, possibly using

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
ground-penetrating radar
to see if there's actually

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.269 align:middle line:90%
material below it.

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, like we find
at the pyramids, for example,

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:16.269 align:middle line:84%
then realize there's
structure there.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah,
I mean, if you have

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
a wall and somebody built it,
chances are they left garbage.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as humans, one
of the things we excel at

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
is leaving garbage everywhere.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So even in ancient
times, they would

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
leave shells, broken
tools, little bits

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and pieces of stuff.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bodies.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Bodies, right, sure.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully there are no bodies.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could the wall be
older than people think?

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't carbon
date it, unfortunately,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
but maybe there's
things, like you just

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
said, in the area that
you might be able to.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, one of the
things that's interesting,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I've got a couple of
rough dates on it.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that was interesting

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is that even without trying
to date it-- and yeah,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
you can carbon date it--
is that there are stretches

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of the wall where acorns
fell out of trees,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and the acorn opened, and the
tree actually grew out of it

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and bifurcated the wall,
and now it's a huge tree.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So the time it takes
for that tree to grow

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
gives you some idea
of how old it is.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I was on a show, and they
did attempt to date it.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The date I got back, the
conservative estimate

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
is maybe 400 to 500 years,
anywhere from 300 to 500 years

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The more liberal estimate
is higher, is more than 700.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's talk that
there's other walls around?

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Correct.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's a wall that runs
from San Jose to the Carquinez

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.054 align:middle line:90%
Strait.

00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
There's another wall
that gets picked up

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and it goes across
Marin out to Point Reyes

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
and then goes north.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
follow these walls,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and I came across some
research done by some others.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out there's a
whole bunch of walls scattered

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:90%
all over northern California.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.926 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think, Olav,
there's some connection

00:06:57.926 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:90%
between all these walls?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.828 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I do.

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's a
large-scale lost civilization.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons being is
that the walls are constructed

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.996 align:middle line:90%
in a very similar way.

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You have a mountain, and
around of base of the mountain,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
spreading out in a
circle, are more walls.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And the walls always go across
the tops of ridge lines.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And so in all these areas
in northern California

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
where we have exceedingly high
peaks like Shasta or the buttes

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or in Mount Diablo, we have
walls associated with them.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Like Shasta has walls around it.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Mount Diablo has
walls around it.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a kind
of structure to it

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be consistent.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It also stops at Fresno.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go any further
south than Fresno.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And as it goes in the extreme
northern part of the state,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
they're more concentrated.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you go south,
they become more diffuse.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
it was concentrated

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
in the northern part of the
state and along the coast.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they had a bullet
train from LA to San Francisco

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and this was the path.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.495 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I wish we could
find that bullet train.

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It would make my life easier.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.188 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What oes
your gut tell you

00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
civilization involved

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and the purpose of a wall.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because as
far as I'm concerned,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
a wall is to keep
something out or in.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Right.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I find interesting

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is that in doing the research,
I did a lot of research

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:90%
into the Yurok.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:10%
And the Yurok are a
Native American group

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:10%
that live in the northern
part of the state.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They actually have a legend
of what's called the Wagas.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Wagas were a
light-skinned people

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
that came to the
Yurok centuries,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
centuries-- they talked about
it being 10,000 years ago

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
That's probably too much,
but many thousands of years

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
ago, these people came to
them and taught them things

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and tried to help them
to learn how to fish,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to grow, to
learn how to build things.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And one day, these people left.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And they went back
up into the mountains

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
where they had come from
and to the north where

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:90%
they had come down from.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we'll
be back some day.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately
for the Yurok,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
when European
settlers came, they

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
thought it was the Wagas,
which didn't turn out too well.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:90%
But

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
this kind of notion that there
was a preexisting group there,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that they came down out of the
mountains and from the north

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and taught them things and then
decided they wanted to leave,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.457 align:middle line:84%
disappeared up into the
mountains and to the north,

00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
well, that's where
we find this stuff.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We find this stuff in
mountains and to the north.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
So that seems to be consistent.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
What's odd is that
they're light-skinned,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:90%
kind of Anglofied people.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's strange, because
there shouldn't be any there.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.839 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Nobody knows.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They built structures on top
of mountains in the area.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
They told the Yurok to look
after these structures,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that one day they
would come back.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They left behind one
person who is a half Yurok.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
half Wagas to care
for their deer

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
that the deer were

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
kind of like their pets.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And they had a whole fairly
sophisticated trough system

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:90%
set up to feed deer.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he
got tired of waiting,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and he told the people
that were helping them,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
the Yurok, well, I'm
going to leave now.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back
to be with them.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:90%
So he disappeared.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
He walked off into the forest
going north and he was gone.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Far-out theory.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Extraterrestrials?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: You know, I think
at this point anything's game.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's not the theory
that I would gravitate toward,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
but in the absence of
any evidence at all,

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I think it's worthwhile.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are things out
there that do defy explanation.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.879 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it as researchers,

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the things
that disturbed me,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
is that archaeologists
have never looked at it.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
As researchers, you have
to have an open mind.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at
all the possibilities

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and then figure out
what the right one is.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why haven't these
archaeologists jumped in there?

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think a lot of
it has to do with funding.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.181 align:middle line:84%
They go after things
that get them funding.

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And make money.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: And make money.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the world
is turned by money.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that archaeology
is run that way as well.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's always
been talk of giants

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:90%
around Catalina Island.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And what about this area?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.212 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't there some kind
of discovery with bones

00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.753 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah,
there was, actually.

00:11:24.753 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In Concord, California,
which is probably

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe 20 miles
away from the wall,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
they found an eight-foot
tall giant, a burial site

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:90%
of an eight-foot tall giant.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Smithsonian--
usual story,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:90%
you've heard this before.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I have.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.684 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS:
Smithsonian comes in.

00:11:42.684 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:90%
They date it.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:90%
They say it's really old.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:90%
It's strange.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of weird
grave goods around it.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Then they take it.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.384 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:11:50.384 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Can't find any record of it.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
they put these things?

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Probably
in a vault somewhere.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Down in the
basement in Washington, DC.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Down in the third
sub-basement, I would imagine.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE] stuff.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you compare it to
the stories of Lemuria?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, I think if I
had to look at one explanation,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that Lemuria is
probably the most logical.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things that you see

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
is that Lamuria-- in case
the listeners don't know,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of
parallel to Atlantis.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria exists in the Pacific.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis is in the Atlantic.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.765 align:middle line:84%
And Lemuria died in
an catastrophic event.

00:12:28.765 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
an island nation?

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: It was
an island nation.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And they had connections
out through everywhere.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
persistent stories

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is that when Lemuria
was destroyed,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.375 align:middle line:84%
however it was destroyed, the
survivors came to California.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see a
lot of weird things

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
here, Catalina, even
in the Mojave Desert.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Shasta was supposedly--
many people,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the Rosicrucians, for
example, believe the Lemurians

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
live in Mount Shasta.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So in California, we took
the survivors, so to speak.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But they also went down
into South America,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
went down into Central
America, and they went up

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
into Oregon and Washington.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.622 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly where in the
Pacific might it have been?

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It's hard to say.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Some people put it
in the Indian Ocean,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
which I think is
a little too far.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.981 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly it was pretty close
to the center of the Pacific

00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Magna Bowl?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The Magna
Bowl is very interesting.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
one of the reasons

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
why I believe in
things like Lemuria.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The Magna Bowl is a
bowl that's completely

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
covered in cuneiform,
Babylonian cuneiform.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking Iraq,
the Middle East, right?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So this bowl was discovered in
a place called Pumapunku, which

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:90%
is in the Altiplano in Bolivia.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can explain how a
bowl that's dedicated to Ishtar

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and was given two virgins
of the Ishtar cult

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
ended up in Bolivia.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just popped up?

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.718 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Apparently
it just popped up.

00:13:56.718 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what makes more sense
is that you have something,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
it had to get there somehow.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So somebody either had to
sail across the Pacific

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
from the Middle
East with this bowl,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's an accompanying
statute as well.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:90%
There's not just a bowl.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a statue, also
completely covered

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:90%
in cuneiform.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And it can be translated.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It has been translated.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've got this
bowl and this statute,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%
it gets there somehow.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Either somebody crossed the
Pacific Ocean with this thing,

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:10%
or more likely they
went somewhere,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:10%
maybe they picked it
up as a tourist item

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:10%
or they traded for it, whatever.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:84%
They end up with it
on a central location,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and then that same
person says, well, I'm

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
going to go over
here, and that happens

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
to be Bolivia and the Altiplano.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
entire case in terms

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.564 align:middle line:84%
of your involvement in the
puzzlement of what it might be,

00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:90%
what does it tell you?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
What's the central theme of
what might be going on here?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: That our region
of the world, the west coast,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is a lot older and a lot
more visited than we think.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Than we though.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.529 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just Christopher
Columbus, was it?

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No, no.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Chinese came.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
There's good evidence
the Chinese came.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence
that other people

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
came even older than that.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got this mysterious
lost civilization that exists.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
You've got Babylonian
bowls appearing in Bolivia.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got other Middle Eastern
items that have shown up

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:90%
along the central--

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.751 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Egyptian
hieroglyphs, right?

00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Egyptian
hieroglyphs in the Grand Canyon.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:10%
Supposedly there's an
Egyptian burial site

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:10%
in the Grand Canyon.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:10%
This seems to indicate
that movement,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:10%
kind of pre-Columbian
movement, was

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.852 align:middle line:10%
a lot more sophisticated than
what we were taught in school.

00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Put the mindset of
an ancient explorer.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You're looking out
over an ocean, one,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
thinking you fall
off at the end.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
What would possess them,
Olav, to get in a boat

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and just keep sailing?

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at some point because
of the vastness of the ocean,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:90%
they had to give up.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, what are we doing?

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
This is ridiculous.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one, they
didn't know that there

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:84%
was a land in North America
or Central America or South

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
just by appearance.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.517 align:middle line:84%
It was trial and error,
I would assume, right?

00:16:21.517 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think the
central theme there,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
if you want to put yourself in
that position, is at these guys

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:84%
were adventurers, that when
Columbus did sail across,

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that his crew became
very concerned that they

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
were going to fall off
the edge of the world.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
The Vikings were the same way.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
As the Vikings were sailing
across the North Atlantic

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:84%
toward Greenland
and Iceland, they

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
thought that they were going
to die and never make it back.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:90%
What pushes them forward?

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the adventure
of it, the conquest of it.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the same reason
we go into space.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the same reason that we
go down deep into the ocean.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:90%
We've got to see what's there.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And conventional
thought being, I'm

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:84%
going to fall off the
edge of the world, that

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
will work for 80% of
the people in the world,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
but there's always 10% or
20% of the people, that's

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%
not good enough.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They literally have to fall
off the edge of the world.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
believe that the fire is hot

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:90%
until they touch it.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.628 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
believe that they're

00:17:18.628 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
going to get electrocuted
by an electric fence

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:90%
until they hold it.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.381 align:middle line:90%
They have to actually do it.

00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
perseverance, though,

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:90%
to keep pushing and going.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.025 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I gotta
tell you, if I were

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:84%
a sailor on a ship
traveling through the ocean,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.672 align:middle line:90%
seeing no land mass--

00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It's scary.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
talking, what, months?

00:17:36.338 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Months.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you might
say, maybe we should go back.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.396 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Thor Heyerdahl
is a great example.

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Thor Heyerdahl was
an anthropologist.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to prove that
the Egyptians could

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%
have sailed across the ocean.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So he created Ra.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And the first Ra sank.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But he was daring
enough to say, I

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
want to prove that
this could work.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So he built a reed
ship, and he attempted

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:90%
to sail across the ocean.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.364 align:middle line:90%
The second time, he made it.

00:18:02.364 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, he said,
well, you know what?

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to prove that the
Polynesians could have sailed--

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did Kon-Tiki.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: In Kon-Tiki.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:90%
What drove him to do it?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the daring-ness,
the adventure

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
of attempting to try to
prove that it was real

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and the fearlessness of that.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it takes those
kind of fearless people

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.152 align:middle line:84%
to go into space, to
go deep into the ocean,

00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to try to go through
the rainforest

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
to find lost civilizations.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:90%
We have to have the--

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:33.455 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The drive?

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The drive and
the heroic-ness to do it.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think
that that's lost today,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
that we step back too far.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We send probes out into space
to see the rings of Saturn.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.351 align:middle line:84%
Really, I think as humans we
need to go see that ourselves.

00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We're with Olav Phillips, of
course, conspiracy researcher.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they say
conspiracy researcher,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:90%
what do they mean by that?

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, I like to do
research, and a lot of times

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I end up doing research
about conspiracies.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: So you know, the
thing about it is that much

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.135 align:middle line:84%
like the wall and much like
those kinds of ancient--

00:19:13.135 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You like
adventure, don't you?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I like adventure,
and I like puzzles.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And these things
are all puzzles.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Who built that wall?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Who-- I don't know.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the conspiracies, there's
a lot. [LAUGHS] Pick one.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:90%
But you know, who did it?

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
What was the motivation?

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a motivation
for what they do.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
What was their motivation
in doing this thing?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
favorite conspiracy, Olav?

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I like the
secretive space program.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.412 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:19:41.412 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And I like
ancient mysteries.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.203 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do think there
is a secret space program?

00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been going
on for a long time.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Very long time.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
bases on the moon,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, the
far side of the moon?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I think so.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people think that.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.033 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think
I think that there

00:19:56.033 --> 00:19:59.475 align:middle line:84%
are bases on Venus and
on Mars and on the moon.

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
makes you say that?

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.225 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
the Venus thing

00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:05.895 align:middle line:84%
is different, but on Mars, even
aside from the face on Mars

00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:08.969 align:middle line:84%
and the folis and the
pyramid and all that,

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it, you can
actually find the buildings.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.507 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:20:12.507 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
You can't hide this stuff.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange structures.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.128 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Strange
structures that

00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:90%
were built by human beings.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And they're there.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You just have to look.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, if you
look enough, you

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
can see the tracks
of the vehicles.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this stuff is there.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:90%
You just have to look.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That our
astronauts didn't go to.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something else.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:32.878 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You just have to look for it.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think much like the wall,
one of the things that happens

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.005 align:middle line:84%
is that as humans,
we become complacent.

00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We get up, and we go to work,
and we come home from work.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really try
to understand things

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:90%
beyond our immediate scope.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And so these things are
staring you right in the face,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
but you don't see it, because
you don't want to see it

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
or you're not putting yourself
in a position to see it.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if we had advanced
ancient civilizations that

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:84%
had capability-- we
see, for example,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.904 align:middle line:84%
in the old Sanskrits of India
flying machines, vermanas.

00:21:13.904 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Vermanas, right.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were everywhere.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
What if we had the capability
of going in the moon

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
with an advanced civilization
that somehow got blown up

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
or something happened to them
hundreds of millions of years

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that when
you talk about a secret space

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
program, we may also be talking
about planetary visitations,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
going to the moon with
these ancients from a long,

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
long time ago?

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes,
and I think things

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
like this, what we were
talking about before,

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I think they play into it.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
You look at some of these
structures that are built,

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
very sophisticated, and
you look at the Vedas

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Sanskrit and
the vermanas and all that,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about very
sophisticated things.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's completely
conceivable that that happened.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 15,000 years
ago, supposedly there

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
was a battle between two cities,
Mohenjo and Harappa in India.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And they fought it out in
this huge cataclysmic war.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nukes.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.885 align:middle line:84%
I would argue today's kinetic
energy weapons, but yeah.

00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
There are two different
schools of thought on that.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They might
have even been

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:90%
more advanced than we thought.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They
were more advanced.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.142 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
around 15,000 years ago,

00:22:35.142 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
you have this Black
Knight satellite that

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
shows up-- at the same time.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, conventionally, the
Black Knight, for example,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.834 align:middle line:84%
people believe that it
was actually like a probe.

00:22:49.834 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
But what if it wasn't?

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What if it actually came
from Herappa or Mohenjo?

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:10%
What if it actually
was a weapons platform

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.197 align:middle line:10%
or if it was a ship
that they had built?

00:22:59.197 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's supposed
to still be up there.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It is up there now.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do great
research, all open.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
For people who
want to track what

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:90%
you do, how do they find you?

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Anomalies.net.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's
it, anomalies.net.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Olav, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Thank you very much.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.138 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's just
fascinating just

00:23:14.138 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:10%
to imagine that past
civilizations might

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:10%
have built structures and
walls or been to the moon.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:10%
It just makes you
think, doesn't it?

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:90%
