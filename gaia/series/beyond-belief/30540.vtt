>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.774 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.595 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:34.145 align:middle line:90%

>> NARRATOR: And now the host
of the nationally syndicated

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Did you know
that only 15% of the known

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
species on this planet
have been discovered?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
That means there's 85% of
the animals and creatures

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
out there that we don't
even know what they are.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on "Beyond Belief"
is the Crypto Hunter.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
He investigates creatures.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.231 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear it for John Rhodes.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.213 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:06.585 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:07.668 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good to see you.

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:08.159 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> JOHN RHODES: Good
to see you again, too.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, very much.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.175 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
the name the Crypto Hunter?

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Let's see.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was because I
had a curiosity for just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
about everything,
since I was a child.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And crypto really
is Greek for hidden.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically
hunt for hidden things.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
If it's an animal
that hasn't been seen,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
or if it's a mystery
that hasn't been solved,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I love, just a curious mind
always wanting satisfaction.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we talk
about crypto creatures.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.713 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about?

00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
What's the range, here?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Actually,
like you said, upfront,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
15% of all the animals on
Earth have been discovered.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So that means actually
85% of all life on Earth,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:90%
we've yet to encounter at all.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.538 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah, it is.

00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, some of
it is rather unusual.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- a great
majority of it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
are insects, small snakes,
and such like that.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But on occasion, we actually
do encounter animals

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that are large
animals, something

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the rumors
from the local villages

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
or different areas have
had as part of their myth.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And we go out into nature and we
actually look for these animals

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
to substantiate their reality.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you know,
when I hear crypto, John,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
about I hear creatures, I think
about Bigfoot, chupacabra,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
the thunderbirds, those large
birds that Native Americans

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:90%
would talk about.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kind of creatures
that come to mind, quite often.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen a lot?

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
They think of those
creatures, primarily?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.722 align:middle line:84%
And you know, larger
creatures, such as the Bigfoot,

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and such like that, you have
to remember, a number of years

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
ago the mountain gorilla
was considered a myth.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Nobody had ever seen one before.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.077 align:middle line:84%
They heard about these large
man-like creatures that

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:52.785 align:middle line:84%
lived in the jungle
and occasionally they

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
would come out.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
They were mostly peaceful.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
almost 100 years ago

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
that we actually went
out there and discovered

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.687 align:middle line:84%
that these actual
creatures live.

00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And now we know them as the
gentle giants that they are.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
our ancestors, you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
know, because we're
related to them.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What takes so long for
us to discover these creatures?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: The fact that a
large part of the planet has yet

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:90%
to be explored.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these creatures are
living in jungle habitats

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
or rainforests where it's
very dense in vegetation,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and it's difficult to get to.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, it's a matter

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:90%
of where the money is going to.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research
money goes out to find

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
animals that are going
extinct, which, as you know,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
this is the big question now,
as to how weather change is

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:90%
affecting animal ecosystems.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's just not
that much interest

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
in finding out what's
new, because they haven't

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:90%
figured out what exists yet.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I remember on a "Coast
to Coast" show on April 1,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:84%
some time ago, I had a story
of the discovery of a baby

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
brontosaurus, in the
Congo, in that region.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And how would it had eaten
one of the crew members

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:90%
who had discovered it.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we all know
they're vegetarians.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I broke the
story on April 1.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But I had this professor
come on from a university who

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
talked about this
little creature.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But bottom line
is, is it possible

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that we could have a
dinosaur out there somewhere

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:90%
that we just haven't discovered?

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes and no.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say, perhaps, not a
dinosaur as we recognize them

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.075 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember, and we
can get into this little later,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that birds actually
evolved from dinosaurs.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So we think of a
dinosaur as how we're

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:90%
looking at them in story books.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And what the professors tell us.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But actually, if they didn't
die out 65 million years ago,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of things
they could have grown into.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just until recently
we discover the birds.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If we haven't
discovered 85% of the creatures

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, today, what do
you think the possibilities are

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of life forms
on Mars, or Venus, or Europa,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
one of the moons?

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: I think
is highly possible.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the interior
of our local solar system,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the planets interior of
our local solar system,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
actually, are more habitable
for life than on the surface.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going
to discover any life

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
in our local solar
system, or perhaps even

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
outside our solar
system, we should

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
be focused on
looking underground

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
where river systems
are, and such like that.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of life here on Earth

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that lives underground,
without any light whatsoever.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.759 align:middle line:84%
But as long as it has an
ecosystem that can basically

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
feed it, that's
where, I think, we're

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.799 align:middle line:84%
going to be finding
those creatures.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, but aren't
they just weird looking,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
creatures John?

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Most of them.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Usually animals that
live in an environment

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
like cave salamanders, and such,
they lose their pigmentation,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and they turn out
rather white looking.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
that they either go blind,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
they have blind cave
fish, for example,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
because they have
no need for eyes,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
or in the case,
what we're talking

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
about with other things,
their eyes actually

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:90%
might be getting bigger.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do specialize in,
in terms of creature hunting?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:90%
What are some of your favorites?

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Well, my favorite
personal one is that reptilian

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.941 align:middle line:84%
humanoids that we suspect
may have evolved along side

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:90%
of humans.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.064 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa!

00:06:12.064 --> 00:06:13.265 align:middle line:90%
Reptilian humanoids?

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are the they?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: There was a
scientist by the name of--

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're not
pulling my leg, are you?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: No, no.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.615 align:middle line:84%
There was a
scientist by the name

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
of Dale Russell, who was asked
by NASA to project forward

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial life might
look like on another planet.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he
took the troodon dinosaur,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
65 million years ago,
and based on the way

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.056 align:middle line:84%
that it's bones
made it look like,

00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and they could
piece it together,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
through time-morphological
changes,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
at 65 million years ago,
when it passed away,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
he basically took those
morphological changes

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and projected them outwards.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was, is it came up

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
with a humanoid model
that was reptilian

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:90%
in its physical features.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Three fingers, with an opposable
thumb, and such like that.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he presented
this to NASA.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Now he said that if the
dinosaurs would have evolved,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
they could potentially have
reached this physical form.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what, in ancient history,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
we've heard about when we
talk about reptilian entities,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
or beings influencing
ancient cultures.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Or we're talking
about modern times,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
where we have the discussion,
nowadays, more and more,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
where people are talking
about meeting something,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
not the little grey diminutive
little beings with the large

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
eyes, or the human looking
ones, like the Nordic beautiful

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But out of the shadows
came this figure

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be
reptilian-humanoid.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:47.007 align:middle line:84%
And it pretty much has become
a large basis for ufology now.

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of the information out
there, even on the internet,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is not talking about
the small greys,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
it's talking about the
reptilian-humanoids.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.058 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, when you think
of the old biblical accounts

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.802 align:middle line:90%
of what Satan looked like.

00:07:57.802 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Right.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Kind of with horns
and somewhat of a tail.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that sound like
exactly one of these creatures?

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes, it does.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's made to sound like
one of these creatures.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had a personal theory that,
if we have a small population

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
base of them on this planet,
because we outnumber them

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
by masses on the surface,
then I can imagine

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that they are
living underground,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and that they're enjoying their
anonymity as a fact of reality.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
As long as we keep
them in the idea

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's an unrealistic thing,
and it's all ufology talk,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:90%
then they're safe.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And they should be safe.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.071 align:middle line:84%
Our reactions, our
human reactions

00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to new things on the
surface of the Earth,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:90%
they're not always peaceful.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And we discover things
we don't understand,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
we often attack it first,
before we start spending time

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
studying it and accepting it.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These
reptilian-humanoids,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:90%
how advanced are they?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Do they have high technology?

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.112 align:middle line:90%
Are they primitive?

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: They have
advanced technology.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.695 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say they're
more advanced than us,

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
because I think that they're
using parts of their brain

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that are not mammalian brains,
and so their perceptions are

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
completely different
than our own.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, some snakes
can see into the infrared.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, they might have
technologies and devices that

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
work on infrared, where
we wouldn't see things,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:90%
but they would.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And if they're even
100 years more advanced

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.904 align:middle line:84%
than us, based on Moore's Law of
Progression of every two years

00:09:22.904 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
you double your
progress, then you

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.569 align:middle line:84%
can only imagine, even if
they were 100 years from us,

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:30.212 align:middle line:84%
what we might perceive them
as-- perhaps even magical.

00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have to keep that into
perspective, as human beings.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you want
to confront one of these?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: I wouldn't.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Face to face?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.418 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: I wouldn't
confront him.

00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I'd, perhaps, meet him.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The idea that something
6 and 1/2, 7, 8 feet

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
tall, and is highly muscular
and it's got a humanoid form,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
perhaps long nails on it,
three, four inches in length,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.537 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to get into
a combat situation with it.

00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they walk upright?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.203 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: They do walk upright.

00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, the earliest

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
mentions, even in biblical
works and such like that,

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
from the older
Judaic texts talked

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
about the serpent walking
upright on two legs

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.767 align:middle line:84%
and having hands and
hands and legs of a man.

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
interesting, that, perhaps

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in ancient cultures, we actually
were in contact with them.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then for some reason, maybe
somebody else told them to,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
or they decided to, they
went deeper underground

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.834 align:middle line:90%
and leave us alone for a while.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's kind of
interesting, because even

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
in Biblical works,
as other works,

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
they talk about there had
been some fall of man.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And for that punishment he is
separated from the serpent.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent is
cast onto his belly.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And it says there
that there will

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
be an enmity between
man and the snake.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
directive of God.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
other religions,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
when Christian religion came
in and they needed a nemesis

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.611 align:middle line:84%
opposite of the feathered
dove, which was the snake,

00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because the snake and
the bird have always

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
been polarized opposite
symbols, that image of the snake

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
was then turned
around and vilified.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because actually it's a deeper
part of our own history,

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.919 align:middle line:84%
since human beings actually
evolved from early reptiles.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've
got to tell you, John,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a fan of
snakes nor spiders.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, snakes,
to me, have always been--

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's
ingrained-- somewhat evil.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but I've
always grown up that way,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.027 align:middle line:90%
thinking snakes are evil.

00:11:22.027 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're not, are they?

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: No.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%
No they're not evil.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.644 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've made a lot
of evil human beings.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I've been out into
the wilderness a lot,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.495 align:middle line:84%
and I've certainly saw a
lot of snakes go that way,

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:90%
when I'm going.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't blame them.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Right.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually the
nature within a serpent

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
to actually avoid
humans, because they're

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
afraid of humans just as much
as we are afraid of them.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the accidental encounters
that create us a problem.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And as much as why we're
feeling that they're

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
evil and everything,
I personally believe,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
through the years of research--
I'm talk in excess of 20 years,

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've known
you for a long time--

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
that early religions, in order
to control human beings more,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to go
to the churches to say,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
give us the answers, they
took an ancient animal

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that, actually, before the
advent of Christianity,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
most of the world
was actually united

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
through the image of the snake.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Vikings, the
Celts, the Egyptians.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The medical
symbol is a snake, isn't it?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.954 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: This
Asclepios, right.

00:12:15.954 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient Greece, they
had temples call Asclepia.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody
wasn't feeling well,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.349 align:middle line:84%
they would go to the temple and
they would, for three nights,

00:12:25.349 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
they would lay on the floor of
the temple and then be healed.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was so effective that
later on through history,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they took the symbols of
the staff of Asclepios

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.346 align:middle line:84%
with two snakes
entwined around it.

00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I want to talk about
Indiana Jones in a moment.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:84%
That pit he fell into,
with all those snakes.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take
some questions here, now,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
for the Crypto
Hunter, John Rhodes.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Have you got a question
about reptilian-humanoids,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.325 align:middle line:90%
or Bigfoot, or chupacabras?

00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
All the way from
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Is there any
physical evidence of these

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.397 align:middle line:90%
creatures been found?

00:12:58.397 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: No.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
remember, when we're

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.428 align:middle line:84%
talking about physical
evidence, especially something

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
as ancient as that,
it's only, perhaps,

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
one out of a
billion actual bones

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that makes it to
become a fossil.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about a
small population group hidden

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.847 align:middle line:84%
in very remote
areas, their dead,

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they would
dispose of their dead.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Most likely in underground
caves and caverns.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's not actually very
accessible by us anymore,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:90%
the average person.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It is by scientists,
because as of 1988, they

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
came up with the Federal Cave
Resources Act, which actually

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
made it illegal
for anybody to go

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
into a cave or a natural
opening within the Earth

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:90%
without a Federal Cave permit.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And being with a
federal representative

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
of the federal government.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And each time you
went into that cave,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it's considered a separate
offense, punishable by,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was $10,000
and one year imprisonment.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.895 align:middle line:84%
So it's only scientists
and it's only people

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
like that that
are actually going

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
to have the courage
to go into caves.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of us stay out of the caves
where these artifacts might be.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only artifacts
that we're talking about,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
it's artifacts
regarding every mystery.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
When they're placed in a cave,
the ambient air temperatures

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and the moisture is so low that
those artifacts are pristine.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
They found that
through the ages.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.937 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Grand
Canyon is filled with caves.

00:14:15.937 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But you can't just go in there
and go in to any cave you want.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and also, in
the follow-up on his question,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
John, it's very rare for people
to find the bones of bear,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.962 align:middle line:84%
the bones of deer, any creature
that would die out there.

00:14:29.962 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Right.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't really
hear those stories, that, hey,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
we just found this
or we found that.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.302 align:middle line:84%
They're dragged off by other
animals and everything else.

00:14:38.302 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: The elephants, for
example, the ivory graveyard,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:90%
the famed ivory graveyard.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Where is it that
elephants go to die,

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
because there must be
billions of dollars

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:90%
worth of ivory there.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's still one of
the great mysteries.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We know they dispose
of their bodies.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.865 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that
easy to find them all.

00:14:52.865 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where do they go?

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
How about another question
for the Crypto Hunter?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.337 align:middle line:90%
Anybody out there?

00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the Grand Canyon,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and I know that there's large
areas of the Grand Canyon that

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.631 align:middle line:84%
are blocked off and that park
rangers have the jurisdiction

00:15:07.631 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
over it.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the park rangers
have had any interaction

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
with, perhaps, any crypto
beings in that area?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: I wouldn't imagine
they've had encounters with

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:90%
crypto beings.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They may have encountered other
types of lost civilization

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:90%
artifacts, as well as cultures.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I have been down into
the Grand Canyon.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a really remarkable place.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of millions
of gallons of fresh water

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that pour in from the local
areas, into the Grand Canyon,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's caves
and caverns in there

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:90%
in which they could exist.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We know that in 1909 there
was an article in the "Arizona

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Gazette" newspaper
that actually spoke

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
about the discovery of
an underground city that

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
was large enough to house 50,000
people, in the Grand Canyon.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.619 align:middle line:84%
But of course, once the
Smithsonian Institution

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
got involved and
everything, and they

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.034 align:middle line:84%
said this was going to
be one of the greatest

00:15:57.034 --> 00:15:59.701 align:middle line:84%
discoveries in mankind,
everything fell quiet.

00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
The newspaper, to this
day, even though it

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
was April 5 of the
newspaper headline,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
the Smithsonian
Institution has written

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
anybody that inquires
saying it was just

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:90%
part of an April fool's joke.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, they usually
would say, did you enjoy

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
our April fool's
joke, the next day.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.856 align:middle line:84%
The credibility of a newspaper
wouldn't be just tossed aside

00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
on a April fool's joke
without explaining it.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why would the
Smithsonian want to cover

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:90%
things up like that?

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: First of all, the
Smithsonian Institution is

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:90%
private.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It was, first of all,
established by the British.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It took a special act through
Congress to allow us to have --

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
let the British in to start
collecting all these artifacts

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.277 align:middle line:90%
around the United States.

00:16:36.277 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And because of it's not
a government agency,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.227 align:middle line:84%
it's not susceptible to Freedom
of Information Act requests.

00:16:41.227 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with the
Rand Corporation, or other

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.649 align:middle line:90%
think tanks like that.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
our government loves

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to take think tanks and
put their secret work

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:90%
in think tanks.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.442 align:middle line:84%
Then your ability
as a free citizen

00:16:51.442 --> 00:16:53.442 align:middle line:84%
to turn around and ask
for evidence regarding it

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:54.858 align:middle line:84%
through Freedom
of Information Act

00:16:54.858 --> 00:16:57.220 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually apply
to private companies.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So the privatization
of our government

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
has actually helped
conceal a great deal of it.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There must be all
kinds of mysteries out there.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
How about another question for
the Crypto Hunter, John Rhodes?

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.192 align:middle line:84%
You back in the far
reaches of this planet.

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You said that you
haven't seen one physically,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:90%
in the real life.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys got proof that
somebody else has seen it,

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:90%
and got pictures of this?

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Somebody
has seen it, John,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
or we wouldn't have
known about it, right?

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.583 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: No, we have a lot
of people who have seen it.

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, in 1988,
down in Bishopville, South

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.247 align:middle line:84%
Carolina, a young
boy had seen one.

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
He was changing his
car tire in middle

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of night alongside
a swamp, and he

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
swears that something
came running after him.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And he took off in this car.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And it jumped on his
car and reached around.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He could see it had three
fingers and an opposable thumb.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
He was so shaken by
it that it took him

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.181 align:middle line:84%
two hours to stop
crying, his parents said.

00:17:48.181 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I hope he
got that tire on fast.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes, actually he did.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.446 align:middle line:84%
He swerved the
car, so that's what

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
threw whatever was
on his roof off.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the thing.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:90%
He passed a polygraph test.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And the local
sheriff down there,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.031 align:middle line:84%
who was a friend of
mine, Liston Truesdale,

00:18:02.031 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:84%
for years after
that case happened,

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
the local people
around, he started

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
hearing other
encounters such as this,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing about
this young boy's report.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And he started correlating it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or
later, it got on, I

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:90%
think, it was NBC and ABC News.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The entire town was filled
with people with hound dogs

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and shotguns who wanted
to go into the swamp

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and kill this thing,
and whoever it was.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.109 align:middle line:84%
And the sheriff said, it turned
into a rather bad situation,

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:28.984 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Have there have been people?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.983 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there was actually
a lieutenant colonel

00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that Liston told me about.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:41.227 align:middle line:84%
He was in the Army, I
think it was the Army.

00:18:41.227 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Or the Corps of Engineers, Army
Corps of Engineers, thank you.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he reported to
Liston that he had seen this.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
This was a colonel who
was about to be promoted

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to general in the Pentagon.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And then Liston had
said, do you want

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.475 align:middle line:90%
to go public with your report?

00:18:55.475 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll have
to contact my attorney

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:90%
and ask him.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he contacted
Liston again and said,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.591 align:middle line:84%
my attorney advises that I
don't talk about it at all.

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:04.715 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: God, what a
frightening feeling that must

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:90%
have been.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.307 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like Moth Man.

00:19:06.307 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: It is a
little bit like Moth Man.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this colonel, he
refused to talk about it.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And Liston told me that he had
called a local newspaper up

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
after many years and
decided to talk about it.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they didn't
respond to him immediately,

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.559 align:middle line:90%
and two weeks later he was dead.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So when he decided to come
out and say something.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.415 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I wonder how
that happened, right?

00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:25.123 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Right.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So we do have-- I'm going
to tell you straight up,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:90%
we're not alone here.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to keep
looking in outer space.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We just have to look at
our own home environment

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and find out where those
visitors have set up shop here.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:90%
That's where we have our money.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:90%
That's where our money can go.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's talk more about
these creatures when we come

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:90%
right back on "Beyond Belief."

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.955 align:middle line:84%
John Rhodes, the Crypto
Hunter our guest.

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:48.884 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:48.884 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We've got the Crypto Hunter
John Rhodes with us here.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
John, we're going to get
into a lot of other creatures

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, or elsewhere.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk with you
a little bit about cattle

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and animal mutilations.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Stories have been -- have
been going on for some time.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
As you know, our investigative
reporter, Linda Moulton Howe

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
uncovered part of those stories
back many, many years ago.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
What is your overall impression
about a real situation that

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:84%
is happening all around this
planet, where animals are

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
having organs
surgically removed,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
cut out with devices that some
mainstream medical places don't

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:90%
even have yet?

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
What' going on?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Well, as you know,
I work side by side with

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.238 align:middle line:84%
sheriff's departments
investigating some animal

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:90%
mutilations.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
since the 1970s, when,

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I know that former Astronaut
Harrison Schmidt actually

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
called for an investigation
into animal mutilations,

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:90%
FBI got involved.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.137 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered in the end
of their lengthy investigation,

00:20:54.137 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
in their report,
they said it was just

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:90%
outside their jurisdiction.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't actually
have any statement.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding
out, though, I think,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is that, whoever's doing
this is trying to point out

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
environmental issues
to us about water,

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
or about different
types of parasites,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.016 align:middle line:84%
or pathogens, that might
get into our food chain.

00:21:13.016 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And because it has to
do with our food chain,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a very difficult
subject to tackle.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that in looking at
some of the animal relations,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:84%
like I have up in Montana
with the sheriffs, for us,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
it pointed to local pathogens
maybe coming out of pig farms.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
That they were using
water, for example,

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.535 align:middle line:84%
mixing pig feces
in with the water,

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would spray
it up into the air

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%
to fertilize the fields.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that when we
start looking at some cattle

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, and you start
plotting them out on a map,

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you can see where they point an
arrowhead towards the direction

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:90%
of up wind, where it's up wind.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
they were spraying

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pig feces with
the water into the air.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Now the air, some
of these times when

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:84%
you see the cattle
mutilations take place,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.628 align:middle line:84%
it will be when
there's high winds.

00:21:59.628 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So that actually
in Montana you can

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
see where the prevalent
winds are, and you can see

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.225 align:middle line:84%
the cattle mutilations all
through the state like this.

00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're saying
the spray may have killed

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:90%
the animals?

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: No, I'm saying
that the spraying may have

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
introduced different
pathogens to them.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And whoever's interested
in doing the cattle

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:84%
mutilations is
actually vetranarial--

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
taking them somewhere else,
dissecting them, and leaving

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the bodies for us to
find, because they

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
want us to wonder if
somebody's medically examining

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
this carcass, maybe
we should be too.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead, most of it's just
laid off as part of fantasy,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually not.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Local law enforcement officials
are very, very interested

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:84%
in talking about animal
mutilations and investigating,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
but they don't get help
from the state level.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
cattle mutilations,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you something, here.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are
you bringing us here?

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, while
you're doing that,

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is a true that under
most mutilation cases,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.307 align:middle line:90%
there's no blood at the scene?

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Well, there's no
blood dripped on the ground.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've disect--

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is
strange, isn't it?

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: It is strange.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.976 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of blood in a cow.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
they're bloodless,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
because I've actually had to
dissect a cow in the field,

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:84%
because an animal, or
a human, when it dies,

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the blood, the gravity
pulls all your water down.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So it sinks to the very
bottom of the carcass.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
In the case with the animals,
you're cutting into them,

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
there's far less blood
than you would ever

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:90%
expect to see on site.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.655 align:middle line:84%
And I was just going to
have you put on that.

00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:24.446 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, a little
specimen today, huh?

00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:24.674 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Oh, yeah.

00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:25.301 align:middle line:90%
And this.

00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
These are one of
the things that you

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
don't get to see very often,
because in television, they

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
like to talk about
things and not

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.607 align:middle line:90%
show you the actual details.

00:23:32.607 --> 00:23:34.481 align:middle line:84%
For example, when they
show you crop circles,

00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
how often do they show
you the microscope

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.448 align:middle line:84%
where it shows that
microwave energy blew open

00:23:38.448 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%
the little modules?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.973 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The glove doesn't fit.

00:23:39.973 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.185 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He didn't do it.

00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'll show you
something here.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It really doesn't.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.691 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: This is
actually-- I know,

00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we're just doing this
for precaution sake.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
something from 2006.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.309 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of hide.

00:23:57.309 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:90%
But I want you to see it.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you can see,
here is one of the things

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that you won't hear, as well.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm investigating with
the sheriffs in the field.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people who
said they're just sliced

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:84%
open with a knife,
and such like that.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you look carefully,
you can see the edge

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
where it was cut with a knife,
where I cut it off the animal.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But on the far side of
it, over like in here,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, when you're
using a laser cutting device,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.864 align:middle line:84%
which we do not
have-- OK, you're

00:24:27.864 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
military, you're

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.696 align:middle line:84%
talking about very
advanced people

00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
to have laser cutting
devices in the field-- it

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
cuts through the flesh.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing
on these pieces, when

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.064 align:middle line:84%
you look under a microscope,
you know it's heat,

00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
because instead
of a straight cut,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
there's like a little cut, a
nodule, a little cut, a nodule.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's like little heat blasts.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And this is the cut?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Right around here?

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.884 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: This was,
yes, this was my cut.

00:24:52.884 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can see around
some of the edges

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:90%
where the fur has curled in.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: This is because
the heat of the laser,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
along the fat, had actually
taken the hair and curled it

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
like a curling iron.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.812 align:middle line:84%
And the tips of the
hair melted into the fat

00:25:04.812 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the cut.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm finding the cow,
I'm finding the actual cut

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
incisions showing
that it was actually

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:90%
heat cut, not that with a knife.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.824 align:middle line:84%
And most of our government,
as well as large corporations,

00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:84%
when they're talking
about the cattle industry

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.531 align:middle line:84%
and such like that,
they don't want anybody

00:25:20.531 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
to be apprehensive in any way,
they don't want to be afraid.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But this type of
information, like this,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:84%
hardly ever makes
it out in the air.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.825 align:middle line:84%
It's just too
politically explosive.

00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
What's you've gut
telling you, John?

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.559 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Again, pathogens,
I think somebody is,

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
you have to wonder, if they're
coming from outer space,

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
why would they be so interested
in our food chain or anything

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
happening here, is

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because it has to
do the water supply,

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and if there's other
beings living our planet

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.477 align:middle line:84%
in rural areas and such,
underground in caverns,

00:25:51.477 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
then whatever you're doing
to the water is all filtering

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.316 align:middle line:90%
down, it's all chain reacted.

00:25:55.316 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're
trying to do is bring out

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
these things to our
attention, to say, listen,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.673 align:middle line:84%
you should stop doing
this, stop doing that.

00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Did you know the big
corporate explosion

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
in the cattle industry
started in the 1970s.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
correlated with the explosion

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.112 align:middle line:90%
of cattle mutilations.

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:13.612 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So are you saying
that there's an extraterrestrial

00:26:13.612 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:90%
event going on here?

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.821 align:middle line:90%
Or something Earth bound?

00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: I think
it's Earth bound,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
in regards to
cattle mutilations.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We've had cases in which people
have seen aliens involved,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:84%
humans involved,
aliens teaching humans

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:90%
how do the cattle mutilations.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we have
corporate interests,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:90%
we have government interests.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, like in
"Contact," there's

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
some really rich guy out
there whose eccentric,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that has his own
group, who doesn't

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.645 align:middle line:90%
care about all the secrecy.

00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But is looking out for
our best interests.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to tell.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But we do know
that it continues.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And much to the chagrin
of local law enforcement,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:84%
they don't get any support
from up the ladder.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:90%
None at all.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.013 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know,
after seeing that,

00:26:56.013 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I may never have a
little steak again.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: No, you
should, though, I mean,

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
look food is good.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Meat is good.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I take these off?

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes, absolutely.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.961 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
just have to be careful.

00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:07.987 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make sure
that we treat our environment

00:27:07.987 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
correctly, because we're
not alone on this planet.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But like I said before, whether
the visitors set up shop here,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
or whether they evolved
here, they are here.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.349 align:middle line:84%
So what we do our planet
affects them, as well.

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've
got to tell you, John.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenon that has
been going on, as you know,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It is very strange, indeed.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The incisions, what's
been going on with them.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.915 align:middle line:84%
And the weird part about
it is, as you mentioned,

00:27:31.915 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
they just kind of like
leave the carcass behind.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.036 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: They want
us to investigate.

00:27:38.036 --> 00:27:39.701 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us
to just brush it off.

00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
They want us to look and
see what parts are missing,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
who would want these parts,
and how they're useful.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.033 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice, most
the parts that are missing

00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:48.622 align:middle line:84%
are usually in animal
veterinarian pathology

00:27:48.622 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to find out about the
death of an animal.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.621 align:middle line:90%
Those parts are actually taken.

00:27:51.621 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Even from the ear to the
mucous membranes in the mouth.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Most pathogens, you have a
nostral, it has all this mucus.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%
This is what captures pathogens.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.495 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're taking
that out of the animals.

00:28:00.495 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.376 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're
going to be back.

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:05.236 align:middle line:84%
More with "Beyond
Belief" in just a moment.

00:28:05.236 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.896 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Norry,
and this, of course,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
is the Crypto
Hunter John Rhodes.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:84%
John, let's take a little bit
of time and talk about bigfoot.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the creatures that I've
been fascinated with since I

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:84%
read a book about
yeti in the Himalayas,

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little boy.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's seen these creatures.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We're getting too
many credible reports

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
from people who see these
things running across the road,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:90%
or in the mountains somewhere.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they are?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Just like
reptilian-humanoids,

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:84%
this is a hominid that
has actually evolved,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
parallel to mankind,
in very remote regions,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:84%
in the very small
population groups.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
And I honestly believe that.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
a reptilian-humanoid

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and, for example, a bigfoot.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
mammal, big hominid creature,

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about a
reptile big hominid creature.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So mammals and reptiles.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Its' just what we have here.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.604 align:middle line:84%
And even the fact that one
has scale and one has fur,

00:29:11.604 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really
make too much of

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:90%
the different, scientifically.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Because after all,
hair is made of keratin

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and says fingernails.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is the same
material inside the body that

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.510 align:middle line:90%
makes the scale for the snake.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And a long time
ago, scales-- when

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
you go to warm-blooded,
hair is actually

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
like the scale formation that's
uplifted and that lays over

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a
thermal barrier,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
so it protects the
animal for heat.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.254 align:middle line:84%
So really, we're not
looking at beings

00:29:37.254 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:90%
that are too much different.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I would say, though, just
as many bigfoot sightings

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that you've had, with people
going out looking for them,

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:84%
you would have just as equal
amount of reports coming in

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
with reptilian-humanoids,
as well.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But the
reptilian-humanoid aspect

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
of cryptozoology on this
planet, in our society,

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
just hasn't introduced
them as heavily.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee
you, they will be.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.452 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bigfoot, more
human, more animal?

00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Human.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:90%
More animal, more human.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right in the middle?

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.679 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they are what they are.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.428 align:middle line:84%
They're more
connected with nature,

00:30:12.428 --> 00:30:14.189 align:middle line:84%
we are, because
interestingly enough,

00:30:14.189 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
we pride ourselves in
governing the planet,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
but we've separated
ourselves from nature.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
It's only now we're
starting to look back

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
into nature to learn
about technologies.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But with bigfoot,
definitely more

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
appears to be, even though, like
with the reptilian-humanoids,

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:84%
you have something that could
destroy you, could beat you up,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
and could kill you.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.775 align:middle line:84%
But we're not getting
these reports.

00:30:33.775 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: So I would say
they're more peaceful,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
they maintain a
distance from us.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think, they
migrate, during seasons,

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.675 align:middle line:84%
along mountain ridges to go
into areas where it's warmer.

00:30:48.675 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There could be what?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a couple thousand?

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Even if there
were, that would be great.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.357 align:middle line:84%
But remember, it only
takes one black dove

00:30:58.357 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to prove that not
all doves are white.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.766 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get calls from
folks on "Coast to Coast"

00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I get calls
from these tough guys

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we're
going to go up there hunting

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to shoot
one of these things.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I try to talk them
out of it saying, no.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't shoot one of
these creatures.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
These things, if you catch
one, they're priceless,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:90%
they're precious.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
eventually, I would

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
hope we're going to find
out what's going on.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean we've had reports of
doctors out there hunting,

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.180 align:middle line:90%
they'll see this.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
People that are
professional, people

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
who are from all walks of life
are seeing these creatures.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I got a call once
from an individual who

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
said he was out fishing, and he
caught two fish about that big.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as he's holding
them walking through the woods,

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.930 align:middle line:90%
he's confronted by a bigfoot.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh no.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So he hands the
fish to the bigfoot.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.656 align:middle line:84%
The bigfoot takes it, looks at
him, and gives him one back.

00:31:56.656 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: That's nice.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now that tells
me, these things are pretty

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:90%
intelligent.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.563 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah, I would say so.

00:32:02.563 --> 00:32:07.777 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they recognize that
they have to stay away from us,

00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:90%
that's a degree of intelligence.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a long
time ago, scientists

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
used to say that
intelligence was

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.797 align:middle line:84%
based on brain wave,
body mass ratio.

00:32:14.797 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they're
finding out now,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
to be a large animal

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
with the huge brain in
order to be intelligent.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The idea of somebody calling
somebody a bird brain

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually a compliment,
because sometimes, birds

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:84%
have shown such
great intelligence.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Speaking of
birds, thunderbirds,

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:84%
these are large birds that
people have reported seeing

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of time,
that are as big Cessna planes,

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:90%
huge.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Cases in point,
woman, in Illinois,

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
has her little boy scooped
up by one of these things.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It literally comes and picks
him up and is flying away.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's swatting at
the thing with a broom,

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and it drops the kid down
to the ground, and he's OK.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't up that high.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.367 align:middle line:84%
I would hate to be taken
to one of their nests.

00:32:59.367 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be pretty big.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.646 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: If you were dinner,
you would hate to be taken

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.562 align:middle line:90%
to one of their nests.

00:33:02.562 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Because there's
some hungry individuals around.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Drop me down into
a little baby thunderbird.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.905 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: With their
mouths like that.

00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:10.071 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But anyway, we
get a lot of these reports,

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:11.697 align:middle line:84%
and primarily from
Native Americans.

00:33:11.697 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Their mythology
had to do with fighting these

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:90%
birds, these huge creatures.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:90%
We still get those sightings.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:90%
They are not condors, are they?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:90%
They're much bigger than that.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.618 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: They're
much larger than that.

00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before, a
great deal of our planet,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.375 align:middle line:84%
even the United
States, there's so much

00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
land here that's never had
a human foot step on it.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that we're kept in
these tight little population

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
areas, and we have such a
grand kind of vista out there.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:84%
If we only had the manpower and
the money to go out and look,

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I think-- and an
open government,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that's what it would take--
we would find out a lot.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you ever been
driving and you see the shadow

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.484 align:middle line:84%
of a plane go across the
road in front of you?

00:33:50.484 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do we know
it's not a thunderbird?

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: As long as you're
keeping your eyes on the road,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:90%
you won't.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They are huge.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: That's right.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There was a story in
Alaska of a guy who was in his

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Cessna and a thunderbird
came right up next to him,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.499 align:middle line:90%
and was bigger than the Cessna.

00:34:06.499 --> 00:34:08.040 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be
kind of frightening.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.989 align:middle line:84%
Most people report
that this bird

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:14.099 align:middle line:84%
looks like a big bird,
does not look prehistoric.

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:15.082 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear that, too?

00:34:15.082 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Yes, I've
heard that, as well.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
Gigantuism is not
abnormal in nature.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we have some
group that's actually

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.473 align:middle line:84%
predisposed to being large,
and they're left separate,

00:34:25.473 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
hunted down, I can

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:84%
imagine they would start a small
population group of their own

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that would have, just
like in families,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.025 align:middle line:84%
you have tall
people in families.

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:84%
We'd have animals that
actually are larger in stature,

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:90%
as well, as small.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.929 align:middle line:84%
Because now we have
small humans that

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:41.344 align:middle line:90%
ran around 12,000 years ago.

00:34:41.344 --> 00:34:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Which kind of brings--

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how
little were they?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.288 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: The Flores people.

00:34:44.288 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were three feet
tall, fully developed.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.944 align:middle line:84%
Now it kind of
gives you an idea,

00:34:48.944 --> 00:34:50.360 align:middle line:84%
when these scholars
are out there.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hobbits.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:51.635 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes.

00:34:51.635 --> 00:34:53.442 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at ancient Egypt,

00:34:53.442 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
you're wondering if the
scholars really had it right.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.191 align:middle line:84%
Was it really the
ego of the Pharaoh?

00:34:57.191 --> 00:34:59.652 align:middle line:84%
Or were they actually
entertaining small people?

00:34:59.652 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know,
they've talked about giants

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:90%
So small people, pretty evident.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.305 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Again, we're
talking about on Flores Island,

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a small island.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The idea that actually, maybe,
there were small people on it,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
because in nature, when
you have a lot of food,

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
people become larger, or
animals become larger.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Like we have,
especially in the West.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.602 align:middle line:84%
But where you have
reduced amounts of food,

00:35:27.602 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
nature is really
interesting, it'll

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:84%
actually downsize the animal
after a number of generations.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So the banana is now twice as
big as you had thought before.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So nature downsizes to make sure
that the impact of depopulation

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:90%
doesn't wipe it out.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.207 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Irish
talked about leprechauns.

00:35:44.207 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Might they've been talking
about these little creatures?

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Sure.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Irish, little Irish
people, why not?

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:84%
If there in Indonesia, why
can't they be in Ireland.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Now Ireland they
say, the Celts say

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that they escaped and hid
in the city, or the hills,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:90%
to the Western part of Ireland.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Now again, we're talking about
somebody being on the surface,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually going
back down underground,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a secrecy
about their existence.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I am amazed at how
ancient mythology generally

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:18.170 align:middle line:84%
leads you to understand what
was really happening on this

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.970 align:middle line:84%
These weren't created,
made up stories, were they?

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Some of them were.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Some of them weren't.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
for the researchers

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to be able to distinguish
which ones were.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.884 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with, when I
meet people who have sightings,

00:36:30.884 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
especially
reptilian-humanoid sightings.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.925 align:middle line:84%
I have to wonder, is this a
figment of their imagination?

00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something
that actually occurred?

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I said,
we're more easily

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:84%
controlled when we vilify an
ancient part of our brain,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:90%
because it makes us fearful.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
something that you're

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.200 align:middle line:84%
naturally afraid of,
that you encounter,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something that
is difficult to overcome.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the reasons we
have the problem with people

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:84%
accepting the idea, even,
of reptilian-humanoids,

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier to
laugh the subject off

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:84%
than it to deal with it,
because it does kind of

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
affect us on a deep
psychological level.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What a
great career you have.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
in the audience for you,

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
John Rhodes, the Crypto Hunter.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's just have
a show of hands.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Sure, right up front, here.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Since the Smithsonian
Institution is often

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
mentioned as a possible
repository for these bones

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and relics and odd things,
has anyone like you,

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.640 align:middle line:84%
a researcher like
you, Mr. Rhodes,

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
ever gone to this
Smithsonian and tried

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
this department is,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.095 align:middle line:84%
or who is it that
has this big picture?

00:37:42.095 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Yeah, It's
an interesting question.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:90%
No, I haven't gone there.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, when
you're stonewalled,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.188 align:middle line:84%
you're stonewalled by
the administration.

00:37:49.188 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:90%
But I can point out is this.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a letter to the
Smithsonian Institution

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:84%
in regards to, like,
the 1909 article.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And without mentioning any
names or anybody like that,

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.519 align:middle line:84%
they just brought
up names and say

00:38:01.519 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:90%
that these people didn't exist.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, they had
heard the story before.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:90%
People had called in before.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So they all kind of know to
give you these general answers.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.960 align:middle line:90%
As far as where are they now?

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I would think that,
knowing human nature,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the
elite, they all like

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.329 align:middle line:90%
to have their own museum items.

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot of
private homes across America--

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I am convinced some
multi-millionaires have so many

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
artifacts that they
have purchased, stolen,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.252 align:middle line:90%
that they have somewhere.

00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:32.418 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: And now we're
hearing that more and more,

00:38:32.418 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
because other
nations, like Egypt,

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
are petitioning other countries
to give them back the artifacts

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that were taken
like 100 years ago.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.507 align:middle line:84%
Human nature and elitism is
this, if I know something

00:38:42.507 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and I have something, I don't
have to show anybody else,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
but I save it for my
partiers, my special friends,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to say let me show
you something.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.738 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well if you
have more money than God,

00:38:50.738 --> 00:38:54.380 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you want to own
the bones of bigfoot,

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.604 align:middle line:90%
or the Loch Ness monster?

00:38:55.604 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Which I want to talk
with you about in minute.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Yeah, I
would say I would.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Although I wouldn't keep it
for a private collection.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.565 align:middle line:84%
How about some more questions
here for John Rhodes?

00:39:04.565 --> 00:39:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Hey, John,
a question for you.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
When you interview
these eye witnesses,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:90%
do they do composite sketches?

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.404 align:middle line:84%
And do those composite
sketches, are they similar?

00:39:17.404 --> 00:39:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: It depends.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.092 align:middle line:84%
If I know-- I've tried to get
artists in the art community

00:39:23.092 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to be able to draw a picture
of a reptilian-humanoid,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.450 align:middle line:84%
but they always want to
put their own slant on it.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.533 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we're dealing
with this subject matter,

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:84%
we can't allow that
creative measure to it.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:90%
To a certain degree, maybe.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But when I see reports of beings
that look too extravagant,

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:84%
then it just kind of
falls to the wayside.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that
they're impossible,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.260 align:middle line:84%
but trying to draw down
the common denominators

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of these beings, helps me
classify which accounts might

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.870 align:middle line:90%
be real, as to which might not.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The reports tend to all
be somewhat similar.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll have been saying that,
for example, the big feet are

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.106 align:middle line:84%
always considered the
same visual image.

00:40:03.106 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But with the
reptilian-humanoid, for example,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.197 align:middle line:84%
you have some with
tails and some without.

00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can't dismiss that,
which you hear it has a tail.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some more
muscular than the others,

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.366 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Absolutely.

00:40:12.366 --> 00:40:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And some smaller and
taller than the others.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to things
like their predisposition,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I got to remind people that most
reptiles, for example, run away

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:84%
from somebody if you
encounter them in the wild.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:90%
They're usually going that way.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
anything to do with us.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they're fast, too.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: They're very fast.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.282 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they'll, as a tip,
they will smell like cucumbers.

00:40:32.282 --> 00:40:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the
wild or in your house

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.456 align:middle line:84%
and you have this overwhelming
smell of cucumbers,

00:40:36.456 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that is kind of the
smell of the snake.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And why do they
smell like cucumbers?

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.431 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Probably the same
way we have smells, as well.

00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't think
we smell like cucumbers.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: No, not
like cucumbers.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen that cologne yet.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about another
question for John Rhodes,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Crypto Hunter?

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:84%
My question is, have
the reptilian-humanoids,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.590 align:middle line:84%
have they advanced
far enough to where

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.530 align:middle line:84%
they have mixed their
DNA with regular humans?

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And they are like,
in our government,

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and can you tell if
they're-- I mean,

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:11.725 align:middle line:84%
I've seen YouTube videos
where they say, their eyes,

00:41:11.725 --> 00:41:12.380 align:middle line:90%
their pupils--

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I know
David Icke's theory,

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:90%
that they are in government.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.389 align:middle line:84%
That they are the elitists,
there's a bloodline out there.

00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: There
are a lot of things.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I notice you're
beginning to grow a tail, John.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:21.520 align:middle line:90%
So you never know.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.486 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: That's why I leaning
forward, it's more comfortable.

00:41:24.486 --> 00:41:26.903 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I mean, have
they intermingled with society?

00:41:26.903 --> 00:41:28.277 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Oh, I
think they have.

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that on
our highest levels,

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.434 align:middle line:84%
not, maybe, in government,
but military intelligence,

00:41:32.434 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:84%
remember, the
President has things

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:90%
outside his need to know.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that hybridization
is part of the project.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.985 align:middle line:84%
Because just as foreign
nations, a long time ago,

00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the Queen of England used
to marry her children off

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Czar of Russia's
child, or something like that,

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.444 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
nations get together.

00:41:47.444 --> 00:41:49.735 align:middle line:84%
Because now they're family,
they shouldn't be fighting.

00:41:49.735 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.426 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: I think
the same thing.

00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Hybridization is part of that
program to indoctrinate us.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
To let us know that there
are a subset of species

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that are generally about
to come about soon.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And it might be the
hybrid children.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
research that I've done,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:84%
it tends to aim back at
Rh negative blood, which

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
only makes up about 5%
of the global population.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.964 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's very unique
in the blood factor, not blood

00:42:18.964 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
type, because there's
A, B, O, and such.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the negative,
if you have a negative.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.333 align:middle line:84%
And actually what
that means is, there

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:84%
is a protein on the
surface of the cell.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
negative, it means

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.701 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have that protein
on the surface of your cell,

00:42:29.701 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:90%
but everybody else does.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to wonder, what
took place on Earth where all

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, everybody
gets mutated in some way,

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
but a small collective
group don't.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Now did something happen on
the surface of the planet

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to introduce this protein,
while this other group

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.340 align:middle line:90%
was underground?

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on, they came
back up, these hybrid children?

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The Pied Piper type
of syndrome, where

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
you have children and lost
people taken and missing.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
they're now being

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.800 align:middle line:84%
taken to be introduced
into another society,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:90%
deep underground.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:90%
But definitely, definitely that.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.439 align:middle line:84%
And I think it just like
everybody has a totem.

00:43:05.439 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I believe, if
we're spiritual beings,

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:84%
we probably
reincarnated many times

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.320 align:middle line:84%
through up through
the animal chain.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.865 align:middle line:84%
And totemism is this aspect
of our own psychology

00:43:13.865 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:84%
that is attracted to
one animal over another,

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:84%
because we recognize
that as being

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
the happiest part
of our existence.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Now so with hybridization,
and such like that,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about now taking
the best human qualities

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and mixing them with
the best reptilian

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:84%
qualities, or bigfoot qualities,
or wherever it might be,

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and joining them
together to improve.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, when you have
nothing left, and all you are

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.224 align:middle line:84%
is a bunch of scientists, there
is only room for improvement.

00:43:39.224 --> 00:43:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think
there are humans,

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:44.250 align:middle line:84%
human-like creatures living
underground right now?

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yes.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.512 align:middle line:90%
I honestly do.

00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How would you like
to stumble across one of those

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:49.595 align:middle line:90%
caverns, huh?

00:43:49.595 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: I would love to.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But you know, again, I
have told people this.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.430 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to
film or have contact

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:84%
with a reptilian-humanoid
or an animal

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that I think would generate
the kind of publicity

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that it did down in South
Carolina, where everybody wants

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.914 align:middle line:84%
to come and shoot it and dissect
it, I might, perhaps, say,

00:44:07.914 --> 00:44:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I found it over there.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.246 align:middle line:84%
When really, I
found it over here.

00:44:10.246 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Because, why would I do that?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:84%
These beings are living
peacefully over here.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.941 align:middle line:84%
Why would I want to encourage
a whole bunch of local yokels

00:44:17.941 --> 00:44:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to come up there with
their pickups and shotguns

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.839 align:middle line:90%
to go kill them?

00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's human nature
to do that, isn't it?

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah, that's right.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And here's an interesting
thing most people don't know.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
In Bishopville,
South Carolina-- how

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.711 align:middle line:84%
the news is controlled--
Bishopville,

00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:84%
South Carolina, Peter van
Sant was sent down there

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to report for, I think it
was CBS or ABC, or NBC,

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
which one he was at.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.880 align:middle line:84%
At the end of his report, when
he's talking to everybody,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, reporters
are not supposed

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.296 align:middle line:84%
to lead their audience
to a conclusion.

00:44:43.296 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the professionalism.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.044 align:middle line:84%
But actually at the
end of the segment,

00:44:46.044 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
he says, now is
this a place where

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.976 align:middle line:84%
there's unknown animals
coming to the surface

00:44:51.976 --> 00:44:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and they're scaring people?

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a bunch of
people making stories up

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.534 align:middle line:90%
to excite everybody?

00:44:56.534 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A little
advocacy there.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: You decide.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.569 align:middle line:90%
Now see that, you decide.

00:44:59.569 --> 00:45:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we're coming
back in just a moment,

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.550 align:middle line:90%
"Beyond Belief."

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.345 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:04.345 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.300 align:middle line:90%
with John Rhodes.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
little surprise for you,

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.339 align:middle line:90%
I hate surprises.

00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:84%
John, I want to talk
with you briefly

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.964 align:middle line:90%
about Nessie, Loch Ness.

00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
look at this equipment

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:90%
that you've brought here.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to look at
the surprise you've brought us,

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.050 align:middle line:90%
here in the audience.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nessie, I have been
fascinated with this creature

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:90%
since I was a boy.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a plesiosaur
there in the Loch Ness,

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:34.310 align:middle line:90%
a dinosaur from way back when.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a picture taken in
National Geographic magazine

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:84%
that looked like a
fin of a plesiosaur.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing creatures
in this loch of water.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it is?

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: I agree with you.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it is a throwback to
the dinosaur age, that actually

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.350 align:middle line:84%
found a very deep ecosystem
inside those lochs

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:90%
to where it's hiding.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
doesn't necessarily

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:84%
have to be just
under water, so boats

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.634 align:middle line:84%
can do their echo
sounding and see it.

00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Just like
alligators and crocodiles,

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:84%
they'll snatch their prey
and put them underneath a den

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.687 align:middle line:84%
that's actually underneath,
built by twigs and such.

00:46:08.687 --> 00:46:10.811 align:middle line:84%
And some of these have air
in them, and everything.

00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:90%
But you'll never see there.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're
talking about the same thing,

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.330 align:middle line:90%
up in the loch.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.581 align:middle line:84%
And it's pre-adapted
to a cold environment,

00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:19.580 align:middle line:90%
which is really unusual.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, millions of
years ago, Scotland

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
climate it does now.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It was actually very temperate.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
wasn't just cold,

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:84%
where reptiles found
it difficult to live.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Now some of the
interesting things

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:84%
is, when a
de-speciation happens,

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.550 align:middle line:84%
like when a meteorite
impacts the Earth

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and such, the creatures that
live underground, or live

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in these pocketed
ecosystems, tend

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.164 align:middle line:84%
to fare the destruction a lot
better than the larger ones.

00:46:49.164 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: And some
of them do evolve.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And some of them do survive.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Nessie is
definitely one of those.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I would just love
for it to be a dinosaur,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.934 align:middle line:84%
rather than an eel, that so
many people have talked about.

00:47:02.934 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: But then again,
we have to remember about

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.270 align:middle line:84%
dinosaurs, when we
think about them,

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.365 align:middle line:84%
some of them didn't
exactly die out,

00:47:11.365 --> 00:47:12.910 align:middle line:84%
which we can get
into a little bit.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:90%
They evolved into birds.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.156 align:middle line:84%
But we wouldn't recognize
one from the other nowadays.

00:47:16.156 --> 00:47:17.614 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, we
probably wouldn't.

00:47:17.614 --> 00:47:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But why do we all want it
to be a dinosaur or an ET

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.050 align:middle line:84%
from a planetary
system, as opposed

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to from our own planet,
or some other dimension?

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We seem to
romanticize and really

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:84%
want these creatures
to exist, don't we?

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: I think we do.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have
hope that, in the failure

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:84%
of our leadership, globally,
and the environment,

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and corporations
taking over that we

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.160 align:middle line:84%
would hope that something
bigger than us would come along

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to inspire us to do something
greater than with what

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.800 align:middle line:90%
we have done right now.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And we need that inspiration.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We do.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: And I think
that we need the idea that

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.904 align:middle line:84%
something's greater than us,
that we have to look forward

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:54.860 align:middle line:90%
to and survive.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Is pretty dismal life on the
planet, when you have war

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and you have a global economy,
based on the production of war.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing,
it's like I've always

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.982 align:middle line:84%
wondered, how can
you ever have peace

00:48:07.982 --> 00:48:09.690 align:middle line:84%
when you have so much
of a global economy

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:90%
based on the war machine?

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It's almost counter to it.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have
peace without war.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.152 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What have
you brought here?

00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Well, what I brought
here is just a quick set up

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that most people can do, if
they're looking for UFOs,

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:90%
and such like that that we do.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:28.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually up near the
Yosemite National Park.

00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: So this is a real
area where you have a lot

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.226 align:middle line:84%
of availability to get
out and look into nature.

00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that everybody can do

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is, there's brackets-- I'll
show you this real quick.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.730 align:middle line:84%
You see here, basically,
two HD cameras.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.215 align:middle line:90%
They're set up side by side.

00:48:42.215 --> 00:48:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You have them on a bracket.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.154 align:middle line:84%
You aim them towards
the same place.

00:48:45.154 --> 00:48:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You turn them on
at the same time.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Now if anybody
says that something

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.780 align:middle line:84%
is an artifact of
the camera, you

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.390 align:middle line:84%
have a second camera
to show it's not

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.070 align:middle line:90%
an artifact of the camera.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.510 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, when
you're zooming in and looking

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.649 align:middle line:84%
for things, you have
another camera pulled back.

00:48:58.649 --> 00:49:00.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
have to be highly

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.670 align:middle line:84%
creative and inventive
in order to figure out

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.472 align:middle line:84%
how you can avoid the
explanations by the people who

00:49:06.472 --> 00:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
are the doubters,
to say, oh, well,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just artifact
from the camera.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.446 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So you a redundancy.

00:49:11.446 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Yeah, a
built in redundancy.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we're actually looking
for craft and creatures,

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not only a matter
of looking for them,

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm into the thing where
I go out and I track,

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.260 align:middle line:90%
and I actually try and bait in.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And if they're like
moths to a flame,

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:84%
we've used variable
speed strobes

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:84%
at different frequencies, with
different colors of lights,

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.405 align:middle line:90%
flashing them in the sky.

00:49:30.405 --> 00:49:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a good idea.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.634 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: What happens is, you
have a higher chance of an ET

00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:36.800 align:middle line:84%
contact if you're driving
your car out in the middle

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere when you're alone,
because then there's no eye

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:90%
witnesses around.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And they're very curious.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:90%
They're very curious beings.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:84%
More curious than they
are anything else.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they see something
that's out of the normal,

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:84%
they want to send something
down to have a look at it.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So this is
the way to do, John.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Right, flashing
lights and such like that is,

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.040 align:middle line:90%
is abnormal.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You and a company
called Scales N, with an N,

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:03.014 align:middle line:84%
scalesntails.com have brought
us somebody named Clyde.

00:50:03.014 --> 00:50:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So let's bring Clyde
in and take a look at Clyde.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Ugh!

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.519 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: A round of
applause for the snake!

00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:12.018 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:12.018 --> 00:50:12.477 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is this?

00:50:12.477 --> 00:50:13.854 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Oh, wonderful.

00:50:13.854 --> 00:50:15.192 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Clyde.

00:50:15.192 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is this?

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And watch your microphone,
there, John, so Clyde doesn't--

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.263 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Clyde is
a boa constrictor.

00:50:20.263 --> 00:50:21.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is Chad.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.724 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Chad.

00:50:21.724 --> 00:50:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> CHAD: Burmese

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.473 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Burmese, sorry.

00:50:23.473 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why is it sticking
its tongue out at me?

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Actually, you
know, you'll see snakes,

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.390 align:middle line:90%
how they flick their tongue out.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:31.394 align:middle line:84%
We evolved from
ancient reptiles.

00:50:31.394 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
the Jacobson's organ,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.893 align:middle line:84%
at the roof of the
mouth of the snake.

00:50:34.893 --> 00:50:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
taking air samples

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and flicking them back
and rubbing them on this.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually, those nerve
centers go their brain.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hold him up a
little bit, too, John.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.385 align:middle line:90%
Can you stand up with him?

00:50:45.385 --> 00:50:46.051 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah.

00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The nerve centers
go to our brain.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Stand over there.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: The nerve centers
go to our brain, and, actually,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:84%
with the snake, these
chemicals are actually turned

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.492 align:middle line:84%
into a visual thing,
like a heads up display,

00:50:59.492 --> 00:51:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to where they can see
things not normally seen.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He doesn't
like me, John.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.846 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Yeah, he's
staring at you, isn't he.

00:51:03.846 --> 00:51:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, man.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.553 align:middle line:90%
He's going to lunge.

00:51:05.553 --> 00:51:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Hold onto him.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.399 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: No, he's beautiful.

00:51:07.399 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But actually, they found
out, much later on,

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:84%
as we evolved from
early reptiles,

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:15.310 align:middle line:84%
we have a similar organ, and
it's about two centimeters up

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
from the tip of our
nose, because eventually,

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
when we evolved,
it went upwards.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.227 align:middle line:84%
Our nose separated from our
jaw, and these two little organs

00:51:23.227 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:84%
are actually underneath
the tip of our nose.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
these are, they

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.910 align:middle line:84%
call it a vomeronasal
organ, VNO.

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And they say that these are the
actual sensory items that we

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:84%
have as a throwback to out
times as snakes, or reptiles.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.629 align:middle line:84%
And we pick up pheromones
from other people.

00:51:42.629 --> 00:51:44.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you feel
a scent of an attraction

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.670 align:middle line:90%
to another person.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You may not understand
what's happening,

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.712 align:middle line:84%
but these chemicals
are actually going in,

00:51:49.712 --> 00:51:52.170 align:middle line:84%
into your nose in here, and
they're going back to our brain

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.620 align:middle line:90%
and they're appealing to us.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.039 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know, oh,
sweetheart, you're sweet.

00:51:57.039 --> 00:51:58.580 align:middle line:84%
She's hissing in my
ear, beautifully.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.322 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You are one
sick puppy, Rhodes.

00:52:01.322 --> 00:52:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: And so you
know, the thing is,

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have to remember
with articulated-- he's got--

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:08.680 align:middle line:84%
his nostrils aren't
clear, I've heard,

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.610 align:middle line:90%
so he's not hissing to be mad.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So actually what
happened is, we evolved,

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.810 align:middle line:84%
separated from the
early reptiles,

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and we became the
mammals we are today.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Religions like to make you
afraid of snakes, because they

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.863 align:middle line:84%
want to rob you of one of
the greatest things that

00:52:22.863 --> 00:52:26.320 align:middle line:84%
used to unite ancient cultures
was the symbol of the snake.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.737 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
fear the snake,

00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:29.986 align:middle line:84%
you're going to fear an
ancient part of your own brain

00:52:29.986 --> 00:52:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that tries to express
itself to you, spiritually,

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.127 align:middle line:90%
about who you are.

00:52:33.127 --> 00:52:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I touch him?

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.293 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:35.293 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I didn't
say come over here.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.284 align:middle line:84%
Just let me touch
him a little bit.

00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: And some people--

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:44.283 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:52:44.283 --> 00:52:45.340 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Some people that
are actually afraid of snakes,

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and I've told them if
they feel that they've had

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.025 align:middle line:84%
a reptilian-humanoid experience,
is to maybe get some snake

00:52:53.025 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:84%
guard, or something like,
that keeps away snakes,

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.932 align:middle line:84%
and dab a little bit on your
bed post, or in your house,

00:52:57.932 --> 00:52:58.890 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you can imagine if
they came up with a chemical

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to repel snakes, its
most likely going

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to offend a
reptilian-humanoid, as well.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.547 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I can feel the feet
of a little human in here.

00:53:07.547 --> 00:53:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: Yeah, actually.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And to show the point,
the actual serpent

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
popular images

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to have if people are taking
ayahuasca or magic mushrooms.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is one another reason
why, in ancient cultures,

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.570 align:middle line:90%
it became such a profound image.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Those guys in Mexico, where
we have all this UFO activity,

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:84%
remember the Aztecs, they
were doing mushrooms,

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.549 align:middle line:84%
they were going into
underground caves and caverns

00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and closing their eyes
and letting God tell them.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It was their TV set at the time.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
image that influenced

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.635 align:middle line:90%
the world previously, the most.

00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's
coming closer to me.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat there, if you want.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: One of the things
about the reptile is that there

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is a reason why we were told as
wise as reptiles and such like

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.050 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain
amount of innate wisdom

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.050 align:middle line:84%
we have in ourselves
that we embrace

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.670 align:middle line:84%
through actually
accepting the snake image.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to
get desensitized to it.

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you right
now, I personally,

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:12.192 align:middle line:84%
I have a Facebook called
Reptoids are Coming, as well

00:54:12.192 --> 00:54:14.650 align:middle line:84%
as, John Rhodes Crypto Hunter,
but the Reptoids are Coming,

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I point out how in
the recent years,

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.240 align:middle line:84%
we keep repeating all
these dinosaur movies.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you see
reptilian-humanoids coming

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.880 align:middle line:84%
up more and more,
"The Neighbors,"

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
called, just recently

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.340 align:middle line:84%
about reptilian-humanoids
living.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We are being desensitized
to this issue.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I am not the first person
to come along and tell you.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Arthur C Clark tried
to explain that

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.630 align:middle line:84%
in his very first book called
"Childhood's End," in which,

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in the forward, you
look at the book

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and he says that the
thoughts and ideas professed

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:45.840 align:middle line:84%
in this book are not
those of the author.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But yet he was postulating
the possibility

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that, what happens if we had an
extraterrestrial life come down

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to this planet and they
were reptilian-humanoid,

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and they claimed that this
was their planet, originally?

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And from my research,
it does appear

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:90%
that that might be the case.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.160 align:middle line:84%
We had these beings living
on the surface with us

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:05.910 align:middle line:90%
once before.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Some were abandoned
and left behind.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And others went
to explore space.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And this might be
behind the prophecy

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of the return of Quetzalcoatl.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
There might be, actually,
somebody or something coming

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.512 align:middle line:84%
back here to actually
start to live on our planet

00:55:19.512 --> 00:55:20.720 align:middle line:90%
that he left a long time ago.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Now are we going to fend them
off, and say this is ours?

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to allow
them to take up the planet,

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.880 align:middle line:90%
as they did once before?

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And part of this indoctrination
we see here, right now,

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.830 align:middle line:84%
is part of that
process of allowing

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.610 align:middle line:84%
us to be aware of
the possibilities.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.314 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
up to every individual

00:55:39.314 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:90%
to make the decisions.

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trust-- what
happens if we have somebody

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in office that's
afraid of snakes?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You never know?

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting to know Clyde.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:51.315 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
dear friends, eventually.

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: As a matter of fact,
there is something interesting.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a document in
which Ronald Reagan signed

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to his staff writers,
when he came up

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.170 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of talking
to the United Nations

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:03.969 align:middle line:90%
about an extraterrestrial--

00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Presence?

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RHODES: Presence
on this planet.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.050 align:middle line:84%
His handwritten notes,
because his writers tried

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to take that part out of his
speech, no less than two times,

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and he instructed them
to put it back in.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He put it back in.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.730 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> RHODES: He put it in.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.574 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: John
we're out of time.

00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you, the
folks from scalesntails.com

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.510 align:middle line:90%
for bringing Clyde here.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for John
Rhodes Crypto Hunter.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.264 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, John.

00:56:26.264 --> 00:56:28.535 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:28.535 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Creatures, there
are many on this planet,

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.550 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about, that just
haven't been discovered yet,

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:39.870 align:middle line:84%
bigfoot, chupacabras, the
Loch Ness monster, who knows?

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day we'll
get the answer.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.716 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
us on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:45.716 --> 00:57:04.150 align:middle line:90%
