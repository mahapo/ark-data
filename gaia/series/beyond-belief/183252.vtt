00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
We've got a different
topic for you today.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Walter Bosley is with
us, and he explores

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:10%
the history behind some
of the most popular

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
alternative research topics.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, exactly what
does that mean?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be using
his past experience

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:10%
as an advisor for
the national security

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:10%
groups about his skills and
experience in investigating

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:10%
mysteries of the past with
extraordinary phenomena

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:10%
and forces around them.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Walter, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WALTER BOSLEY: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You have
investigated lots

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of different strange
things, haven't you?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all this?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: This really started
with a book about Disneyland.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd had--

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wait a minute.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The Disneyland we
all know and love?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.965 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: The Magic
Kingdom in California.

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.145 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Absolutely.

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:10%
I had an interesting
experience when

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:10%
I was a teenager that
kind of stuck with me.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And when I started
digging into Disneyland,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:10%
I found that there was some
possible esoteric engineering

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:10%
that went into, some
hermetic engineering, that

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:10%
went into the building
of Disneyland.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
pulling threads

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
after finishing
that book, that led

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to what appeared to
me to be a series

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
of occult-motivated
serial murders

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
in San Bernardino,
California, 100 years ago.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And pulling those
threads led to all sorts

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
of weird stuff, including Juan
Cabrillo and the mysteries

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of Juan Cabrillo, his death,
his possible connection

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:90%
with the Knights Templar.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And that opened up
a series of books

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that I have done about
historical figures who

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
I think had a personal
quest embedded

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in their known
historical exploits.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These
historical figures,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:90%
were they taught these things?

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: They were,
in this particular case

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
so far in the series,
men, who because

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
of their upbringing,
their education,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and their professional
exploits, it kind of led them

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
into learning more about
the ancient mysteries,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of ancient
history, as it were.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: One of those
historical figures

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk about
tonight is Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Indeed.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell us about him,
first of all, as an individual.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Napoleon
Bonaparte, I discovered

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
through my research, which
was about a yearlong effort,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
was not the man who we're taught
about in school and in movies.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
He was actually a wittier,
more positive kind

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.992 align:middle line:84%
of guy, funny guy,
brilliant mind.

00:03:07.992 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's the guy who had
his hand in his coat, right?

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, in one he did.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I think he did one painting
like that, and it stuck forever.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Everybody
remembers that one.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Right, yeah.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But he had a brilliant
mathematical mind.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated with
ancient history and science.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The very things that
your viewers and folks

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
like us are really into,
he was crazy about.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:90%
That was his first love.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:10%
He happened to be a
brilliant military leader,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:10%
and it turned out also had a
genius for civic administration

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:10%
and such.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:84%
As I said, he's not the
man that we were taught

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:90%
about in school or in films.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
That was greatly the product of
propaganda during his lifetime.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
There were nine Napoleonic Wars.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
He only started one.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Eight of them were
started by the British

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and the European dynasties
that opposed him.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
The countries--

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He helped finish them.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: He did.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he is credited
with the final nail

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in the coffin of
the feudal system

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because what was left
of the feudal system

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
by the 19th century, their
conflict with Napoleon

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
really brought that to an end.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
He was a product of
the Enlightenment Age.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What I remember about
Napoleon, though, in school

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:90%
is the two things.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.078 align:middle line:90%
One, the hand in his shirt.

00:04:24.078 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to tell us about that.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:90%
What the heck was he doing?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: There's
not much to it.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What's in there?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
What's in that coat?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.768 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It was just a
posture for a painting.

00:04:30.768 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And the fact
that he lost at Waterloo,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we remember.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, that is used now

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
for people who have failed
in whatever they've done.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
They say it was my Waterloo.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What the
heck was Waterloo?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Waterloo
was the battle

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in which a number of
things kind of went wrong.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
First, just good old-fashioned
misjudgment on his part.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
He didn't read the lay
of the land the way

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
the Prussians and
Wellington's forces did.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of got caught
with his britches down,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
however, there's

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that he was
not able to rely on his,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
what I think, were
psychic skills.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.052 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They didn't
work this time.

00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: They didn't
work because there

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is an issue of an
interesting object, which

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
possibly through
psychometry, Napoleon

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
had been able to better
judge situations.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.653 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible he lost that
object prior to the battle.

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
By losing at Waterloo,
what happened to him?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He was finally forced
to abdicate the second time.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.368 align:middle line:84%
He, of course, had been pushed
out before, 100 days before,

00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
because he spent-- or the
prior year-- because he spent

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the time on Elba,
the island of Elba,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
in exile, from which
he escaped and returned

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to power for his 100
days before Waterloo.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But he was forced to
abdicate the second time.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
interesting story there,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because Napoleon Bonaparte
and his older brother Joseph

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.043 align:middle line:90%
looked remarkably alike.

00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
They used to be
confused for each other.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.335 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The old
sleight of hand, huh?

00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It is a
documented historical fact--

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
multiple biographers
report this--

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that his brother Joseph, when
Napoleon was fleeing Europe,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
his brother Joseph
came home at Rochefort

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:90%
and begged him to switch places.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
We're told that Joseph twice
said, let us switch places.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Let them take me, and you get
on this American ship that's

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
waiting eight miles off
the coast right now.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
There were two American
naval officers there.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.347 align:middle line:84%
They'll take the
boat, and they'll

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
take you to America, because
he wanted to come to America.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We are told that he did
not take Joseph's offer.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I think he did.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And the third part of my book
is all about Napoleon actually

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.207 align:middle line:84%
coming to America under the
identity of his brother.

00:07:05.207 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he
stayed here and died.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: And he stayed here.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it looks
like he died in Europe

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
under the identity
of his brother.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, before he
came here then, if he did,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
he traveled all around the
world, including Egypt.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He went
to Egypt in 1798.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Why?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Ostensibly to
conquer the territory,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:90%
to put French control in place.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Also so that they could
control access to India

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and block the British Empire
from expanding into India.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think Napoleon had a
different motive for going,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and it had everything to
do with ancient history

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and his interest
in the lost science

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
of that forgotten civilization.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Didn't he take a lot
of well-known educated people

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
with him?

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, he took over 500
of what he called the savants.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
These were scientists,
archaeologists, engineers,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
mathematicians,
hermetic scientists,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
every scientific
discipline you can imagine.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
He took over 500 of
these guys with him.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
His officers on his
boats, his ships,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe that
they were sharing

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
their space with scientists,
with professors and such.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were wondering, why
did he bring all these guys?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But once they got to
Egypt, it became apparent,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
because essentially these were
the guys who established what

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.232 align:middle line:90%
we know today as Egyptology.

00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He had a
motivation, didn't he?

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Well, yes he did.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for some
certain things, I'm convinced.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he find
what he was looking for?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Essentially, yes.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
specific examples

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of suspected technology
and ancient knowledge.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I think he found it.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I think this reveals why he
went to the various places

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
he went while in Egypt,
but also in-- those days

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
they called Jordan and Palestine
and all that area Syria.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.698 align:middle line:90%
It was all called Syria.

00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It was all one piece.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the places
I think he visited

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
was Petra, which
technically wasn't

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
discovered until some
years after he went there.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:84%
However, he was
known to have gone

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to the city which is today the
place you go to to go to Petra.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I think he and his savants
indeed went to Petra.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:90%
They kept it secret.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It was Napoleon's
people who found

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
the Rosetta Stone, of course.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
one of his two officers

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that found the Rosetta Stone
was Colonel d'Hautpoul.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And the d'Hautpoul
family was involved

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in the mystery of the
Rennes-le-Chateau and all

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
that father-son Niort stuff.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Walter, tell us
about the Hypogeum in Malta.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: The Hypogeum is
an interesting structure

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
which is ancient, kind of
mysterious, its origin.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But it has certain
properties, particularly

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:90%
properties of resonance.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.875 align:middle line:84%
Now, this same kind of
technology as the Hypogeum

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:90%
on Malta is found in Egypt.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Aha.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: And what's interesting
is most people that formulated

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
a plan to invade Egypt
prior to Napoleon used

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Crete as the launching spot.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:10%
But Napoleon selected Malta
for his launching platform,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:10%
you might say, into Egypt, I
think because of the Hypogeum

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:10%
the other secrets of Malta.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way, the
Knights of Malta were there,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and I think they
knew all about it.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
He took a contingency of 37
members of the Knights of Malta

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:90%
with him to Egypt.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.008 align:middle line:90%
He recruited 17 of the Knights.

00:11:00.008 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, let's
see a little bit more

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:90%
about this so-called Hypogeum.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.504 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.504 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:10%
>>(ON VIDEO) The
Hypogeum consists

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:10%
of three underground
chambers dug directly

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:10%
into the limestone.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:10%
It's an example of negative
architecture, where the design

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:10%
and decoration is made
by removing material, not

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:10%
adding it.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's incredible to
think that all of this

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:10%
was done before the
wheel was invented

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:10%
and before metal tools
were available in Malta.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:10%
Everything here was carved
out by flints, antlers,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:10%
and other simple
Stone Age tools.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:10%
It was used as a burial
chamber and a cemetery.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And though
archaeologists initially

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:10%
estimated around 7,000
burials, newer techniques

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:10%
have revised the
number much lower.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:10%
There's some amazing
detail as well,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:10%
like a room that has excellent
acoustics for chanting,

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:10%
another room decorated
with red paint swirls,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:10%
a room oriented to
the winter solstice,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:10%
and a beautiful little clay
figurine known as the sleeping

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:10%
lady.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.545 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting area.

00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, it is.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I disagree with the carved
out of flints and antlers.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a little bit
more technological know-how

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
that went into it.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.752 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who built that place?

00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Who knows?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The Etruscans have been
connected with Malta,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:90%
but this was before them.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a mystery, which I think
the Knights of Malta knew.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
We're told that the Hypogeum was
not, again, was not discovered

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:90%
until after Napoleon's time.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's my opinion that
the Knights of Malta,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
their savants, their
knowledgeable men,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.505 align:middle line:90%
knew about the Hypogeum.

00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's
the significance

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of this region, this area?

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well,
Malta is, of course,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
a good strategic vantage point.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So it made sense for
Napoleon to go there.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of his
Egyptian campaign

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
was everything he proposed
to get approval for it made

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:90%
political and strategic sense.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there
were these ancient mysteries

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:90%
connected with these sites.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was his prime
motive for going there.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to
embed what I think

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
was his secret personal
quest into this very

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
logical expedition of
conquest for France.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Did he go
there with an army, or--

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: He did.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
He did bring an army.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So it looked like he
was warring when he got there?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, and he did do
some warring when he got there.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It was a conquest.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They went in and conquered
the local smaller

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:90%
kingdoms and such.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But embedded within
this was his purpose

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
to look for any signs of
this ancient civilization

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge
and the technology

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:90%
that he suspected was there.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Was he respected?

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Highly.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:90%
His men loved him.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And when he would go in
and conquer, so to speak,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
the people would love him.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: While in Egypt, he
went to see the Great Pyramids.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, he did.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.065 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now,
obviously, anybody

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
would want to do that
if you're in Egypt.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But he had a different
motive, didn't he?

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Absolutely.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that he
suspected what he

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
might find inside the Great
Pyramid in particular.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.782 align:middle line:90%
And I think he found it.

00:14:17.782 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do
you think it was?

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, it was something
that I do not think he

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:90%
expected the impact on him.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The legend is that
Napoleon spent a night

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid,
in the King's Chamber.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And this remained a legend for--

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In a
sarcophagus, maybe.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: In the
granite box, yeah.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just lying there?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Apparently so.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.077 align:middle line:84%
He was in there for seven
hours, according to the sources.

00:14:43.077 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Seven hours?

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.007 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Seven hours.

00:14:45.007 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And when he emerged,
according to the story,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:90%
he was pale and shaken.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And when his personal
assistant bodyguard

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.617 align:middle line:84%
asked him what had happened, he
said, you would not believe it.

00:14:54.617 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The Gaia
series, of courses,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is called "Ancient
Civilizations."

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They've taken a look at the
mysteries of the Great Pyramid.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>(ON VIDEO) The Great Pyramid
is speaking that language.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It's transmitting that language.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a silent language, if you
like, that needs to be read.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't need Egyptologists.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't need experts
in hieroglyphs.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have hieroglyphs.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:90%
We need mathematicians.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We need mathematicians
to read it.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Indeed, the purpose of the
Great Pyramid was to educate

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
humans on our place
in time and space.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Could it also be a device to
help change our consciousness?

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I have, for a long while,
argued that the central concept

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of certainly the
pyramids of Egypt--

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and I think the case is
true all over the world--

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
was to do with
the transformation

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Whatever else the Great Pyramid
is, the Great Pyramid of Giza

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, whatever
else it is, it

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
is for sure an instrument that
works upon human consciousness.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.213 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So Napoleon was
after something, wasn't he?

00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, he was.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
His personal mentor, and
a man he took with him

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
among the scientists,
was a gentleman

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Gaspard Monge.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Gaspard Monge.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Gaspard Monge
is known as the father

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:90%
of descriptive geometry.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
He is also the namesake
of a theory he had,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
of something called
the Monge point.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Monge point is a
place, kind of a sweet spot,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
in a tetrahedral
prismatoid where

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:10%
multiple planes intersect.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, a pyramid is
also a prismatoid.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
Monge and Napoleon believed

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that there was a so-called
Monge point, a sweet spot

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramid,
where multiple planes

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:84%
or dimensions intersected and
that they suspected that it

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:90%
was in the King's Chamber.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did Napoleon
come across all this?

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this knowledge wasn't
readily available to people.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Thanks to
Gaspar Monge and other men

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
he was surrounded
with in his lifetime,

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
he was born with this love
for history and science.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated with
it from childhood.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had the mentorship
of Gaspard Monge

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
when he became a young man.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:90%
But all his life--

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They were friends?

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Louis Monge was one
of Napoleon's instructors

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
at the military school
that he attended.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And being surrounded
by these men who

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
knew these interesting
secrets and had

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
these interesting
ideas, he pretty much

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:84%
had kind of the hermetic
science upbringing.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was there a myth
surrounding this visitation

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:90%
by Napoleon?

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
The story that he visited
and spent the night in there

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
is part of this myth.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, a couple of historians
write that he never

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:90%
went into the pyramid.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But most sources
at the time had him

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
going into the Great
Pyramid more than once.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So we know through
historical sources

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that he did indeed spend
time inside the pyramid.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is he left not

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
too long after this particular
night in the pyramid.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Shaken, as you said.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
He emerged from the
pyramid pale and shaken.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after
that, he arranged

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.420 align:middle line:90%
to leave Egypt secretly.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think happened to him?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think
that he experienced

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
connecting his consciousness
at this Monge point

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:90%
inside the pyramid.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did it scare him?

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: A little bit,
because he had been--

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
all his adult life, he'd been
an advocate and practitioner

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:90%
of deep meditation.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
He even wrote in his own letters
that through meditation, he

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
was able to understand
situations better.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was before
going to Egypt.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So here you have a guy who's
really into deep meditation.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
His personal close
friend and mentor

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is the namesake of
this Monge point,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
this theory that
there is a point where

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:90%
multiple dimensions intersect.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So he spends the
night in that part

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, which I'm
convinced they thought

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the Monge point was located.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happened
was he used his meditation

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
techniques while in the
sarcophagus of the King's

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Chamber and had a
psychic connection.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Some
epiphany or something.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think
he was shown, I

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
think he connected to
those multiple planes

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and he saw, possibly,
across time and space.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And it scared him.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: It got his attention.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, it
got his attention.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: As you said, he
fled Egypt right after that.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He shortly-- it
wasn't long after that.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
In those days, things would
take weeks to prepare.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't long
after that he planned

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:90%
to secretly leave Egypt.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
to get back to Europe

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to put what he learned from
his experience in the pyramid

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:90%
into practice.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he
there at the invite

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian government?

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
He was supposed to have been.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But Maurice Talleyrand, his
essential prime advisor,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a shifty character.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And instead of preparing the
way for Napoleon in Egypt,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
instead he went
to Constantinople,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and he helped inspire the
opposition to Napoleon

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:90%
while Napoleon was in Egypt.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he bring
military people with him

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
in addition to these savants?

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.957 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, he
brought a huge army.

00:20:42.957 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually
what we hear about.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.123 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, how
big is a huge army?

00:20:46.123 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Oh,
thousands, in invading.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: And so he was
invading Egypt at the same time?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Was there any place
that this guy didn't go?

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, he went to
all the known cities.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.243 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he went
through Jordan and Palestine,

00:21:06.243 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
which in those days was
just generally called Syria.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he
the ruler of France,

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:90%
or just one of its generals?

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, no.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
He was the ruler of France
after returning from Egypt.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a coup that was
thrown in his support.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
He became the first consul.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.118 align:middle line:84%
And then shortly after that,
he crowned himself emperor.

00:21:22.118 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But he
would go out on some

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:90%
of these military activities?

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: All the time.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which is unusual
for a ruler of a country?

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: By that
time, it became rare.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:90%
But he was out there leading.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
His army loved him because
he would lead from the front.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And he lost very few battles.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
He was in 60 battles,
won 48 of them.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the
remaining 12, he personally

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:84%
was only responsible
for a few of the losses.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In your
research, Walter,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
would you say that
his visitation

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to look at the pyramids
was highly unusual?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: No, not
on the face of it,

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
because here he was a conquering
commander from Europe.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids were the
last of the seven wonders

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of the world that existed.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.125 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: So it would
be a natural curiosity.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's his
personal interest

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that was really
embedded in his reason

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:84%
for being there that was fueling
his desire to see the pyramids.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did he conquer Egypt?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Essentially, yes.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It didn't last for
long after he left.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But while he was there, he
pretty much was in control.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:84%
There were some mistakes
and drawbacks along the way.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think his primary purpose
for being there he achieved

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and had to get back to Europe.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.965 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What did he
learn when he came back

00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:90%
because of Europe--

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Egypt?

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Was it an experience that
just changed him forever?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:10%
I think that what he saw
were all the possibilities

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:10%
of his future, of the future of
Europe in his immediate time.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And he realized that,
with this knowledge,

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:10%
through his own actions and
intentionality, specific

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:10%
intentionality, that he could
alter whatever the path of time

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:10%
would mean for the history of
Europe, the future of Europe.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Was that his ego?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It was interestingly
not his ego so much as his

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
understanding of this bizarre--

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
which would've been
bizarre to him--

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:84%
science of hyperdimensional
knowledge or awareness.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
His consciousness,
which he was already

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
exercising before he
ever went to Egypt,

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.952 align:middle line:84%
greatly expanded after
his experience there.

00:23:58.952 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What did these savant
scientists that he brought,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
these 500 experts, what did
they teach them from this visit?

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: What mostly they did
was explore and investigate

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
the known ancient sites
and really uncover

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the things we know
about ancient Egypt today.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was the intent
for bringing them,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
was to uncover the secrets
of this, back then,

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
a very mysterious civilization.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When Napoleon
was in the pyramids

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and he had this epiphany, did he
come out screaming and yelling?

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It didn't
affect him that way?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No, no.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think because of
Gaspard Monge, in particular,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.420 align:middle line:84%
being there and
being his mentor,

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I think he was prepared
for something to happen.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think the intensity
and the extent to which it

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
was successful, his
connection with consciousness

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to the pyramid, I think
it did startle him.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me about
the Gaspard Monge point.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Gaspard Monge
theorized that within

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:84%
prismatoids, be it tetrahedral
or like the Great Pyramid,

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
a four-sided pyramid, there was
this particular point where--

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: A spot?

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.907 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: A
particular spot, yeah,

00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:10%
like a sweet spot in any
pyramidal structure where

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:10%
the midsection of multiple
planes of reality--

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:10%
time, space, whatever
you want to call it--

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:10%
intersect.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Monge
and Napoleon, of course,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
suspected that the King's
Chamber is where that spot was.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's where
you wanted to be.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah, that's
where you wanted to be.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And with Napoleon
spending seven hours,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
sleeping probably,
inside the sarcophagus,

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
he was inside this granite box.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting is
the granite from the Aswan

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:09.870 align:middle line:84%
quarries, where this is all
from, is 55% quartz crystal.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And quartz crystal is a
piezoelectric material.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And it has been proven to--

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
well, let's say there's so much
of the quartz in the King's

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Chamber that it caused an
induction field of energy.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of boosts
the human consciousness.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you place this induction
field of the energy where

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the Monge point
is, all you need is

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
what's called a coupling
medium between that field

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and what's called as the
field of all possibilities,

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or what we might consider the
Akashic records, so to speak.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And the coupling medium is
the human consciousness.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I think
Napoleon and Monge understood.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Napoleon
successfully deployed.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he trying to
gather some specific energy

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
or anything for himself
by being at that point?

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think knowledge
is what he was after.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened was
what he and Monge suspected

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
could happen.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, it
just opened his eyes

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to literally a whole
world of new possibilities

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that he could affect
the future with his will

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.168 align:middle line:90%
and his intentionality.

00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's
a sacred researcher

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.870 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Freddy Silva.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.436 align:middle line:84%
And Freddy himself visited
the King's Chamber.

00:27:38.436 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>(ON VIDEO) So the
four guys were in there.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says,
well, while we're here

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and we're all alone in this
peace, nice and quiet--

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.685 align:middle line:84%
and at that moment, the
lights went off as well.

00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:49.153 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're in total
pitch darkness.

00:27:49.153 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:90%
You can't see a thing.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, an experience was
being arranged for you.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Something was going on.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, well, we've
got the place to ourselves.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It's pitch dark.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's at least honor this site.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:90%
You do it.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Because you've done this before.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I led this toning,
where you pick up

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
on the resonant
frequency of the chamber.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.717 align:middle line:84%
Each place has its
own particular note.

00:28:07.717 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were sounds
coming out of me

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that had never come out before
and haven't come out since.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other three
guys were also

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
toning with me in
a way I'd never

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:90%
heard them do that before.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
beautiful symphony

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
going on in this chamber.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly-- and
you've got to remember,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.203 align:middle line:90%
this is complete darkness.

00:28:22.203 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't see your
hand in front of you.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I saw with my
vision, there was all

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of these people that came out
of the stone, surrounded us

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in a huge circle, dressed
in the most beautiful sort

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:90%
of silken, white clothing.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Very bright, tall people.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And they just bowed their heads.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.155 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of bowed back, as if
just looking at you right now.

00:28:42.155 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
strangest feeling.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And we kept doing
this and doing this.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.077 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the lights come
back on after 15 minutes.

00:28:49.077 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite clear
that we're quite dazed.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.065 align:middle line:90%
And no one's saying a word.

00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I thought, well, let's take
a moment to go into the coffin

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
as well, although no one's
ever been buried there.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And each of us took turns
lying in the sarcophagus.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're all different heights,
5 foot 5 all the way to myself,

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:90%
who I'm 6 foot 5.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's at least a
foot in discrepancy.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, if you're
looking at it objectively,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:84%
what would you say by
eyesight, the length of that

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:90%
sarcophagus--

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's about the
length of this table.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --sarcophagus would be?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about the
length of this table.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so it's--

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But here's the funny
thing about this story.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got four different
guys, four different widths

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:90%
and heights.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And we all came back down
when the very agitated Arab

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
person was screaming downstairs,
you know, with a finger.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.227 align:middle line:90%
And we're run out of there.

00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we've
overstayed our welcome.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.518 align:middle line:84%
And we went out in
bright daylight.

00:29:34.518 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And we're all very dazed.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite obvious
they want to say something.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all
right, I'll say it.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Did you see what I saw?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And he just carried on
the thought from then

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and said, you mean all of those
people, those priests that

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
came out of the
stones, surrounded us

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
in a big circle
dressed in white?

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, so I didn't
imagine that?

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
You saw that too?

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, I saw that too.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Now that's weird.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Indeed.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.103 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Maybe that's
what Napoleon saw.

00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It
wouldn't surprise me.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
That's interestingly
resonant with, I think,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Napoleon's experience.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:84%
He certainly had something
that startling happen to him.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was in there
for seven hours.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:90%
They were in for 15 minutes.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.555 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That
sarcophagus that we just

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:90%
saw, that's where he was?

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Seven hours.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Just in the chamber.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.885 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just lying there?

00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, I
guess that would

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on
anybody, wouldn't it?

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.495 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Absolutely.

00:30:26.495 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's interesting,
in the story of Jacob

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, he sleeps
when he has his dream.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:84%
His pillow, so to speak, is
a stone, a granite stone.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I find it interesting that
he has this prophetic dream,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.260 align:middle line:84%
this strange experience,
while sleeping

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
with his head on
this granite stone.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Napoleon
inside a granite sarcophagus

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:90%
for seven hours.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And he comes out
after having had

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:90%
an extraordinary experience.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think Napoleon was after?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:90%
What did he want?

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He, in general,
was interested in the lost

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:09.408 align:middle line:84%
ancient history of Earth, of
what went on in this planet.

00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he
thought he'd get it?

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think he thought
that he would learn that.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think he was also
interested in possibly

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.980 align:middle line:84%
some personal information
about his own bloodline.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
There is reason to
suspect that he was indeed

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:84%
a member of the
Merovingian dynasty.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:90%
He suspected it himself.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
I go into that in the book.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on a second volume.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So that gets into
what I'm digging

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:90%
into for the second volume.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's a lot
of research, Walter.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Absolutely.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to read over 5,500, 6,000
pages of biographical material

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:84%
alone on him last year,
just for the first volume.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You had mentioned
earlier the Akashic records,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic records, of course,
being a history of our lives,

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.457 align:middle line:90%
What was Napoleon seeking there?

00:32:02.457 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Again, I think--

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.623 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In your opinion.

00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think information
regarding his own identity.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who he was?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Specifically
dynastic identity.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How old was
he when he was there?

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.305 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: He was not yet 30.

00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, he
was a young guy.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: 28, 20-- oh, yeah.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.903 align:middle line:90%
Young, slim, long hair.

00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:90%
The ladies adored him.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Small stature, right?

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: No, he was
actually average height.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that he's a
short, little pudgy guy.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I thought
he was a 5 foot 4 guy.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: No, I think he
was 5'8'' or 9 or something,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.322 align:middle line:90%
which in those days was--

00:32:32.322 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That was all right.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: It was average.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: It was average, and--

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Probably still is.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Did he find what
he was looking for?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think regarding his
experience in the pyramid, yes,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:84%
because he would see that as
the lost ancient technology

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:90%
that he was seeking.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we know now from
the works of Christopher

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Dunn and Joseph Farrell
and all the others who

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
have pretty much characterized
the Great Pyramid as a machine,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I think Napoleon himself
discovered this pyramid,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
this is a consciousness
machine among other things.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think he did
find, in that sense,

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:90%
what he was looking for.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he also
looking for who built them,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.045 align:middle line:90%
how they were built?

00:33:21.045 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think
that's why he brought

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the savants, the
scientists, with him,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:84%
so that they could possibly
uncover those answers.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I think he himself
was looking for--

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We still
don't know the answer.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Right.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It's still a mystery,
as far as we know.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Dunn believes
it's a power source.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Others believe it's there
as a earthquake preventer.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
it's a landing site

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.425 align:middle line:90%
marker for extraterrestrials.

00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:50.225 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:33:50.225 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: It could be all of it.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or all of the above.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Once Napoleon left,
and you said he changed.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:90%
What happened to him?

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He became-- he
was always a confident guy.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
He never lost battles.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
He always had a good sense
of humor about himself.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is before
Waterloo, obviously, right?

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, yes.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And when he returned
from Egypt, he

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
was even more determined to
make France a much better place

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
than it was at
the time, and then

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to make Europe much more a
product of the Enlightenment,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:84%
to really free the
people of Europe

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
from the yoke of the old
feudal ways, the old politics

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:90%
of the dynasties.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And he accomplished
that to a great extent.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How old was
he when he finally died?

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.429 align:middle line:84%
And again, you assume he
came to the United States.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: I suspect that's--

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.735 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's a great
story all by itself.

00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:90%
The third part of the book is--

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But they don't
teach us that at school.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No, they don't.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.978 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is the clues

00:34:59.978 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
are in the biographical
material of the day.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
He was in his, what I call
the Bonaparte exile on St.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Helena, whom I believe
was Joseph, his brother,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:90%
died in his 50s.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then Napoleon, who I
think was living in America

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:90%
as Joseph, died in the 1840s.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So that put him--
he was in his 60s.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he garner any
wealth while he was the ruler?

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely, of course.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:84%
In those days, from the
days he was a young general

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
before going to Egypt, in those
days when you were a conquering

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:46.670 align:middle line:84%
general, you would get a
piece of the treasure that

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:90%
was seized during the conquest.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon was known to not take
as much as other leaders would.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And he would give much of what
he took personally to France.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.960 align:middle line:84%
He would send it back to
France, to the museums,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to the science organizations.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he look
at the Sphinx as well?

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, of course.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But he was more fascinated
with the pyramid.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who was it,
was that the Germans

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
during World War II who shot
out the face of the Sphinx?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: No, it was actually--

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What group did that?

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Somebody did.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It was one
of the local groups,

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:84%
either the Mamluks or
one of the other groups.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.118 align:middle line:84%
It was not Napoleon's army, who
usually gets blamed for that.

00:36:34.118 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: For everything.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Was he a good guy?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We're told that
Napoleon-- we're taught

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that he was a megalomaniac
and a despot and a tyrant.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
We're taught all this stuff
about Nostradamus predicted

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.508 align:middle line:90%
him, which is not true.

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: As one of
the Antichrists, right?

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Exactly.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was entirely
inspired by British propaganda

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:90%
of the 19th century.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It was determined using a very
poor translation of Nostradamus

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was mostly made up.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The guy who first started that
idea of connecting Napoleon

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
with Nostradamus admitted
later that he had never

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
even read any of Nostradamus'
original writings.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So the whole story of
Napoleon being in Nostradamus

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.610 align:middle line:90%
is not true.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on a bad
translation and essentially

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:90%
fabrications.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that he was
a tyrant and a despot

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:84%
also turns out to be pretty
much British and European

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:90%
propaganda.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why do you think
that they are all warring?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was their purpose?

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:90%
What were they trying to gain?

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Power.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Power and riches.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Mostly power.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:84%
The House of Este was
the controlling dynasty

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that had its tendrils in
all monarchies of Europe

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:90%
at that time, and England.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they didn't want
their good thing taken away

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
their thing upset.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And Napoleon comes along, fueled
by Enlightenment principles,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
much like the
young United States

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:84%
was during their revolution
during his lifetime.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the European dynasties
didn't want that,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
because that would have freed
the people from their control.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is why,
one of the reasons

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
why, that they were so adamantly
opposed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What did he
do wrong at Waterloo?

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, there are
some basic military mistakes

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:84%
he made, like not reading the
territory properly and really

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
not using extensive, thorough
intel the way he should have.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
interesting possibility

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that it has to do with what
he experienced at the pyramid.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Some kind
of psychic thing?

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah,
psychometry specifically.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a gentleman
out there who

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.482 align:middle line:84%
is auctioning what is called
the talisman of Napoleon.

00:39:07.482 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What is that?

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:14.350 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: It is a quartz crystal
little figure of the Sphinx.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: With jewels
and crystal on its base.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Carved out?

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed to have
been the personal object,

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:84%
personal property,
of Napoleon Bonaparte

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and that he carried it
with him after Egypt

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.315 align:middle line:90%
and lost it before Waterloo.

00:39:35.315 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That was
his good luck charm?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.565 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: That was
his good luck charm.

00:39:38.565 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But more specifically,
that was his way

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to connect to this
field of possibilities.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
All the possibilities
of time and space

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that his consciousness
connected into in the pyramid,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:84%
he was able through psychometry,
through this talisman

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, to be able to
determine which move to make.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And losing that talisman,
theoretically before Waterloo,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
robbed him of that
extra tool he had.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And that theoretically
contributed to his loss

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%
at Waterloo.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, how would
the talisman work?

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's my opinion that if it
indeed was Napoleon's talisman,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that the piece of quartz that
the little object was carved

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
from was a piece of quartz
he obtained while in Egypt

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and took with him inside
the King's Chamber.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And that quartz acted like the
recording medium, because this

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.600 align:middle line:90%
was the late 18th century.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:90%
There were no tape recorders.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: But quartz
absorbed the data

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that his consciousness
tapped into.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But how
do you output it?

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Just through--

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Psychometry?

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.630 align:middle line:84%
We're talking classic
psychic abilities here.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And he apparently possessed
them and displayed them.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could
he see the future?

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: I think so.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly saw possible
futures while in the pyramid,

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very possible
that if he had such a talisman,

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
through psychometry, he was able
to tap back into that to make

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:90%
the right moves, so to speak.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: After
Waterloo, Walter,

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
what happened to Napoleon?

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I personally
suspect that he

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.648 align:middle line:84%
took his brother Joseph's
offer and switched places,

00:41:28.648 --> 00:41:30.190 align:middle line:84%
because they looked
almost identical.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That soon?

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Right after?

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: He was on the run.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:90%
He was in Rochefort.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who was
he on the run from?

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.237 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: The British.

00:41:36.237 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:90%
There was a British battleship--

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He had a
price on his head?

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: They were there
to take him or kill him.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And the British
ship was waiting.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
His brother Joseph begged
him, let's switch places.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:90%
They won't know the difference.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.730 align:middle line:84%
There is an American
ship waiting for you

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.813 align:middle line:90%
eight miles off the coast.

00:41:52.813 --> 00:41:54.272 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: A friendly
American ship?

00:41:54.272 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: A friendly
American ship.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are told that
Napoleon decided, no, I'll

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.840 align:middle line:84%
just trust the ethics
and gentlemanly

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.340 align:middle line:90%
nature of the British.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're told that
he turned himself

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in to the "Bellerophon,"
the British ship.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It is my theory,
my hypothesis, I

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.262 align:middle line:84%
think Napoleon took
his brother's offer

00:42:13.262 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:90%
and they switched identities.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And Napoleon made it to America
and lived the rest of his life

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:90%
as Joseph Bonaparte.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he
have a family here?

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Are their offspring
of Napoleon out here?

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: That is something
that I'm investigating

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.052 align:middle line:90%
in the second volume.

00:42:29.052 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What a great
discovery that would be.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, boy.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
a big "oh, boy!"

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.235 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would you like
to interview the offspring

00:42:35.235 --> 00:42:36.260 align:middle line:90%
of Napoleon Bonaparte?

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Absolutely.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:90%
That would be--

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE:
Great-great-great-grandson

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.300 align:middle line:90%
or whoever that would be.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: His younger brother's
son was Charles Bonaparte--

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:84%
grandson, I'm sorry-- was
Charles Bonaparte, who

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:84%
was once secretary of the
US Navy for Teddy Roosevelt.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why would Nostradamus
believe, in his prophecies,

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.508 align:middle line:84%
that someone like Napoleon
could be one of the Antichrists?

00:43:02.508 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Well, that's just it.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
The story that Nostradamus wrote
of Napoleon as an Antichrist

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.050 align:middle line:90%
is not true.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.180 align:middle line:90%
It's been proven to be not true.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.420 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's an interpretation
that it was Napoleon.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't come right out and
say Napoleon, because he didn't

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.640 align:middle line:90%
even know who he was then.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Exactly.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.953 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman, the
scholar who first originated--

00:43:25.953 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is that our
friend John Hogue?

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Was he the one?

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: I don't know.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But this guy who started
this based this whole thing

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.735 align:middle line:84%
on an erroneous English
translation of Nostradamus,

00:43:39.735 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:84%
what's known to be a terrible
translation of Nostradamus.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yes.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are supposed
to be three Antichrists.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The two that they
said was attributed

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to Nostradamus,
Napoleon, Hitler.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.175 align:middle line:90%
And then whoever it may be.

00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: The man
with the blue turban,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.640 align:middle line:90%
I think, it's supposed to be.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Or
something like that.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah,
something like that.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But they
thought maybe bin Laden.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Possibly, yeah.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's been the
reaction to your work?

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: This
book in particular

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:10%
is proving to be my
most popular book.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
People are really
enjoying this one

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:22.820 align:middle line:84%
because it presents things about
this man, Napoleon Bonaparte,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that they never knew,
they were never taught.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was just as
much a surprise to me.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I never expected--
I did not set out

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:90%
to write a book about Napoleon.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I happened to come across a
book, "Bonaparte in Egypt"

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.357 align:middle line:84%
a little over a year ago
in a used book store.

00:44:38.357 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does that ex to any
of the things you've said?

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, it was one
of the main research sources.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
main research source,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.082 align:middle line:84%
because as I got halfway
through this book,

00:44:47.082 --> 00:44:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I realized, wait a minute, I
knew nothing about Napoleon.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I dug deeper,
then I realized,

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've got to
pull these threads.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.748 align:middle line:84%
And it really-- my readers have
really responded to this one.

00:45:01.748 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Though you say
Napoleon was liked and revered

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
by his own people, what did
the British think about him?

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Did they hate him?

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: The British
people, they liked him.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They did?

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Even though he was
used as kind of a boogeyman

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:16.825 align:middle line:90%
by parents.

00:45:16.825 --> 00:45:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They would tell their kids,
oh, if you're out late,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.408 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon's going
to get you and eat

00:45:20.408 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:90%
you and all sorts of things.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.975 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's interesting
is, when they arrested who,

00:45:25.975 --> 00:45:26.850 align:middle line:90%
the Bonaparte exile--

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
thought was Napoleon.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yeah.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Originally the
idea may have been

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to just keep him in house
arrest in an estate in England.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.893 align:middle line:84%
But when they reached
the port in England,

00:45:38.893 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
there were so many
people gathered

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.400 align:middle line:84%
around to see Napoleon
that the British realized,

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.760 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, our
own people are going

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.940 align:middle line:90%
to think this guy's great.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.300 align:middle line:90%
We can't have that.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the decision to
take him to St. Helena

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.757 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a last-minute thing.

00:45:53.757 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If he had
social networking,

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.910 align:middle line:90%
he'd be tweeting like crazy.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Exactly.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid that
if he were in England

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that he would win over the
people, get their sympathy,

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and be released.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he
that charismatic?

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He was that witty
and charming, absolutely.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was a sincere charisma.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.970 align:middle line:90%
He really liked the people.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And he really believed in
the Enlightenment principles.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he
have a bad side?

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you got on his bad
side, what would happen to you?

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:35.780 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He didn't really
come down on people like that.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.940 align:middle line:84%
If he kind of went off
on them, lost his temper,

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:45.017 align:middle line:84%
he would later
admit, hey, I kind of

00:46:45.017 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:90%
flew off the handle there.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The times you can point to
where political enemies were

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.170 align:middle line:90%
punished, he regretted those.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And he mistakenly took
the advice of people

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that he probably shouldn't
have listened to them

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:90%
on those particular instances.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What was
his title, Walter?

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He was a
general at first.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ever
call him the king?

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, he
became first consul.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.837 align:middle line:84%
And then when he crowned
himself, he was the emperor.

00:47:16.837 --> 00:47:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of France.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Of France.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And the people
willingly accepted that?

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: They loved him.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:90%
They loved him.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.457 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was he
loved worldwide?

00:47:28.457 --> 00:47:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He was loved
in the United States.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He was?

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Very much so.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Very admired.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, that's
because the French helped

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:35.650 align:middle line:90%
us get the Brits out.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Sure.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And also the
Enlightenment principles

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.220 align:middle line:90%
were kind of booming here.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The common man could, through
trade, being a merchant,

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.570 align:middle line:90%
could raise his station.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And these were
Enlightenment principles.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
for a guy who was

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.187 align:middle line:84%
all for spreading those
Enlightenment principles back

00:47:57.187 --> 00:47:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in the old country, so to speak.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.812 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Back to the pyramids.

00:47:59.812 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Was it unusual, do you think,
for a leader and a ruler

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to go to Egypt to
do what he did?

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: To do what he did,
what's interesting is Alexander

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.065 align:middle line:84%
the Great took some
scientists and--

00:48:11.065 --> 00:48:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Same thing?

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.023 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: A similar thing.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Not nearly as many.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But you had Alexander
the Great who did this.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.505 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't unheard of,
but it wasn't common.

00:48:21.505 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's
amazing when you

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
look at the pyramids, Walter,
all these great dignitaries

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.940 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of time who
have witnessed these pyramids

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and still to this day, we can't
figure out how it was made,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:90%
how they were made.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Right.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can't.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It's the mystery
of the ages, really,

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.580 align:middle line:90%
that structure alone.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.082 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would you spend
the night in a sarcophagus?

00:48:49.082 --> 00:48:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: In the King's
Chamber of the Great Pyramid?

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You would?

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yes, if I
had the opportunity.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You would see
all these little beings

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that people have seen
and everything else?

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: I would hope.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I would feel disappointed in
my consciousness if I didn't.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.618 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If you had a chance to
see Napoleon and interview him,

00:49:04.618 --> 00:49:06.035 align:middle line:84%
what would be your
first question?

00:49:06.035 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, I
probably would say,

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.570 align:middle line:90%
what did you see in the pyramid?

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the
most astounding,

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.440 align:middle line:84%
mind-blowing episode of his
life, in an amazing life.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I then would ask him, what
did your explorers find

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:90%
in the Louisiana Territory?

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They found something.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think
they did, because--

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Something Egyptian?

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been thought
that that's possible.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Possibly.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I discuss the
interesting discovery

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of that lost city in the
Grand Canyon within a context

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:90%
in this book about Napoleon.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go into
that further, of course,

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:90%
in the second volume.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm right that
Napoleon did come to America,

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I think he got involved with
expeditions of exploration

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in North America and
in South America.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How can you
prove that he came here?

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: The only
way it could be proven

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:10%
would be if documents were
found to attest to that

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:10%
or really through documents.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.572 align:middle line:10%
That's, by now, this is pretty
much all we have left to prove.

00:50:22.572 --> 00:50:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And for people who
want more information, Walter,

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.250 align:middle line:84%
on who you are, where
you are, and what

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.020 align:middle line:90%
you do, how can they find you?

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, my book

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.610 align:middle line:10%

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:36.730 align:middle line:10%
They can find me there.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm on social
media and YouTube.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Under Walter Bosley?

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.480 align:middle line:90%

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.832 align:middle line:90%

having me on, George.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And that's part of
the secret of "Beyond Belief."

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.160 align:middle line:90%
We also learn things.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.600 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like
going back to school.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Who would have ever figured that
Napoleon Bonaparte, the ruler

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:10%
of France, would spend the
hours in the sarcophagus

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:10%
in the Great Pyramid?

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
that, but I do now.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
