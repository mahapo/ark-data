>>GEORGE NOORY: You
are a full-blooded ET.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DEVARA THUNDERBEAT: I guess.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of us are,
I think, you know?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I was born through my mother.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:90%
But we came from Sirius.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They actually took me up in the
ship and brought me to Sirius A

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and stopped me before we
got into Sirius A. He came

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:90%
and did a circle around me.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is he doing?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he's looking
for immoral implants.

>>NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:10%
Devara Thunderbeat is a
sound healer, contactee,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:10%
and a great author.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
She has had contact with
angels, extraterrestrials

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
ever since she
was a little girl.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.145 align:middle line:90%
Devara, welcome to the program.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT:
Thank you, George.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.492 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Wonderful.

00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited to be here.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.033 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did this
all happen for you?

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:10%
>>THUNDERBEAT: It started
when I was four years old.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Four years old?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:10%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:10%
I was playing in the driveway--
broad daylight, Upstate New

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:10%
York.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:10%
And a-- I call it a cloud ship--
came over and pulled me up

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:10%
into the ship.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got beamed up?

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see a beam.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
they're pulling me up.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
pulling me up, my mother

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
ran out of the house
trying to catch me,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and they pulled her up too.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.573 align:middle line:90%
That's where it all started.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you screaming?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: No.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.932 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they were so--

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were calm?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: I was very calm.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.885 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
the ship, they put

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
me on, actually, a silver
table and rolled me

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:90%
down this hallway.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And it was so peaceful.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was passing these
rooms with different colors,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and there were archways--

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%
doorways.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.593 align:middle line:84%
And there were--
each room was lit up.

00:01:57.593 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it
was lit up because I

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
didn't see any mechanical
things inside the rooms.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But each room was
a different color.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they put me
into another room,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
and they shined
golden light onto me.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your name is
Flying Eagle with Many Wings.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought
me back and then put me

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.435 align:middle line:90%
in the driveway--

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:21.235 align:middle line:90%
broad daylight.

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With your mother?

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: And but--
no, my mother wasn't there.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
My mother ran out of the
house after they put me back,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, where
have you been?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
all over for you.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to call the police.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mom, I've
been playing here

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
in the driveway the whole time.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your
mother was panicked.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: So
she couldn't find me.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:90%
So they brought her--

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I guess they brought her up
and then brought her back.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And we both did not remember.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
We didn't remember
what happened until--

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that time?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.112 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: --till I got a
regression with Dolores Cannon.

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I remember bits and pieces.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.993 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what was that?

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
they wanted with a little

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:90%
four-year-old?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Well,
I found out later.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's actually my star family.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
remind me my mission.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a hybrid?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: No.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: No, I am not.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I am-- I'm from
Sirius A, they said.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I volunteered to come
here to help humanity.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
a full-blooded ET.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: I guess.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of us are,
I think, you know?

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now,
here I am talking to you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.122 align:middle line:90%
on our "Beyond Belief" show.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you a human being or
are you an extraterrestrial?

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes,
I'm a human being.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are a human being?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.105 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes, I was
born here through my mom.

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not saying that to
be rude, but I had to ask you.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.612 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That's OK.

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] That's fine.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
No, I was born
through my mother.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:90%
But we came from Sirius.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us have
traveled, we just

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
don't remember that we come
from different planets,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and then either come here
to experience whatever

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
you want to experience
here on the planet Earth,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because we go to many planets
and experience many things

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
on different planets.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.862 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- I shouldn't
say everyone.

00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that for a fact.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But I know a lot of people
are from different planets,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and they just-- they come to
experience and visit or help

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
because Earth was
calling for help.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Mother Gaia was going,
help me, please.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It still is, I think.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of us
helping as much as we can.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On this other planet,
what do they look like?

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.923 align:middle line:90%
I'm always curious.

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: There is
many species on that planet.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
The ones that they said
I'm connected with--

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
there was a lot of pink beings.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
They kind of look
Grey-shaped, like the Greys.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But they're all pink.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big heads?

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Bigger
heads, bigger eyes.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
But they're pink.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And they are very loving
and beautiful emotions.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Like, I've met Greys.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I've met many species, over
a dozen different kinds

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
of species.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.555 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys are
more mechanical.

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:00.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:02.105 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: You
know, they're kind of--

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
some have feelings with
this robotic feeling

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, these pink ones did not.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Then I've met bird beings there.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
They're-- his name was Sulu.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
He said that he was my
left rank commander.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say "bird
beings," they look like birds?

00:05:20.337 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: He had white
hair for feathers-- feathers

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:90%
for white hair or whatever.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And he had-- he looked
human, but he had the pink--

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
more of a pinkish skin.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't a costume?

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It was him?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Him.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's him.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And his eyes were golden
triangles pointing down.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And his pupils were like
beams of light coming out.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine actually
painted a picture of him

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and got very close to
what he looked like.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And then I've met--

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
we're talking just Sirius
A. I met the Golden ones,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:90%
they call them.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They're beautiful, shining
light, all full of gold.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
even have faces.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They just glow this
golden glow light.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's always been
a lot of talk about the Sirius

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:84%
star system because we get a
lot of reports of ET activity

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
from that star system.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, on Gaia's
"Initiation" program,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Matías De Stefano talks about
the relationship between

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:90%
humans, which is what you are--

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.695 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] --and
those from Sirius.

00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:25.495 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: OK.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:10%
- For the people of Earth,
Sirius is like our other sun.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:10%
We have our own sun,
but Sirius was always

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:10%
the guide of our sun.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we do in
our system is guided by them.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
mother star or as we

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:90%
call the sun the father star.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So both of them, the mother
and the father, and our--

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
we're always in connection,
because Sirian people,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:84%
they had personal influence
and personal purposes

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
in our system.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Because even if we are
not exactly the same,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
they had this idea
from the Confederation

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that this planet is one of
the most prepared planets

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
to receive all the genetics
from the whole galaxy

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and to prepare every
species to be aware of who

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
we are as a galaxy.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they had
this personal interest

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying to guide
us from since long time ago,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and humans and
Sirians were really

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
attached at the beginning
of our civilizations.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
teaching us how

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to build the pyramids,
how to build the temples,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
how to handle sound technology.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So they were our
teachers, the ones

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that help us to
understand the universe.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with him?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
talking about also.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.153 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Absolutely.

00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would he know this?

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Well, I
don't know him personally.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he visited there.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could he be from
that star system too?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: I'm not sure.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.992 align:middle line:84%
But it's Sirius A. A lot of
people talk about Sirius B.

00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:90%
It's a big difference.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.005 align:middle line:90%
And they live inside the sun.

00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some stills
I want to look at and have

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%
you go through them for us.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.053 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our first one
and tell us what this is.

00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That's Sulu,
who I was talking about.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
He is the bird being.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's him.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.323 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah, that's him.

00:08:48.323 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:10%
He's got white
feathers for hair.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:10%
That's actually white feathers.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:10%
And he has triangle,
golden eyes pointing down.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:10%
But he looks human.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's his
emblem down there.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:10%
It's like "Star Trek"
has their emblem.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:10%
That's the Sirian
commander emblem,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:10%
and he works with the
Sirian council of light.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How old
would you say he is?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That's--
I never thought of that.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.633 align:middle line:10%
He looks very, very young.

00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They look very--
they're very energized.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:90%
They're higher vibration.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.265 align:middle line:84%
They supposed to be 6D, six
dimensional, six density.

00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what they told me.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at our next picture

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:90%
of a purple-type alien.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.335 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT:
This is like the--

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
similar to the tall Golden
ones, the triangle beings.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:10%
But this one I
met-- he's shorter.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.855 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it alive or a robot?

00:09:42.855 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Alive.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
The way they maneuver is they
float, and then they bounce.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And they float, and they bounce.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And even-- doesn't matter
the density of the air

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
or out in space, but
they can maneuver.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And his purpose--
how I met him--

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
before they actually
took me up in the ship

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and brought me to
Sirius A and stopped me

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
before we got into Sirius
A and was transferring me

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%
into a different ship.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And before they transferred
me into a different ship,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
he came and did a
circle around me.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is he doing?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.147 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he's looking
for immoral implants.

00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Immoral--
what's an immoral--

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.695 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Immoral implant.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
an immoral implant?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That
means a negative implant,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
if somebody implants you
with a negative device.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It is not allowed.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a listening
device or a tracking device

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.603 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Could be
any of that-- all of that,

00:10:41.603 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:84%
actually-- anything negative--
something negative that

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
could maneuver you being
a different person, AI.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So they make sure there's
no negative immoral implants

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.007 align:middle line:84%
in you before you
go to Sirius A.

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if there is?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
They extract it?

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT:
They take them out.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
They take them out.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Next picture
is an angelic alien.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this one.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.555 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this one, Devara.

00:11:05.555 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: This is the
Golden ones I'm talking about.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They're full of golden light.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:90%
The energy of them--

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that golden light
fills the room.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Their light fills the room.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
beautiful, pure light.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at our last picture here.

00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Those are--

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.478 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Typical
alien Grey, right?

00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah,
that is the pink ones.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
They're actually pink,
and they look like Greys.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
But they're pink.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're a whole
different energy.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
They have feelings and emotions,
like some of the Greys do not.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
what they look like.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
But they're pink.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they friendly?

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:90%
They're very loving.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:90%
All of them are loving, happy.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy of fear,
negativity, negative thoughts

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%
on--

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, that's great.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: --yeah,
on Sirius A that I ever

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:90%
felt or experienced.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've had angelic
experiences, too, haven't you?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Absolutely.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.997 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:12:08.997 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
My first one was
when I was overnight

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I did an activation in there.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
finished the activation--

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.327 align:middle line:90%
I play drums, also, and--

00:12:22.327 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you do?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah, and I did
an activation for the pyramid.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And then archangel Gabriel
showed up, appeared,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and he says to me,
color, light, sound.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Seven is a sacred number.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Seven is the sacred number.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Color, light, sound.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
He kept repeating this
over and over again.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh, OK, he's
talking about the seven

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
colors of the rainbow, which
are associated with the chakras.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me there
is a different sound

to activate each chakra.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what I got from it.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:90%
This is in 1997.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
This is before people had chakra
CDs out or anything like that.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:90%
So I came home.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm excited.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
this CD, and it's

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be called
"Chakra Journey."

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And he came with me home
to my house in Sedona

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and helped me write the CD,
giving me the activation

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
tones for each chakra.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there, in
your mind, a difference

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:90%
between angels and ETs?

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.255 align:middle line:90%
Or are they the same?

00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Well, I
think they're all ETs.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
angels hover closer

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, the ones
that are helping here.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.385 align:middle line:84%
And I have actually
seen some with wings.

00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
My Native American side, we
call them from the bird tribe.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have dedicated
themselves to help humanity.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.718 align:middle line:84%
So they are here--
the good angels.

00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: The ETs
live light years away.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.152 align:middle line:90%
The angels are just right here.

00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
constantly trying

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:90%
to teach us how to be godlike?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: No.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
they're here to help.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And they can only help
us if we ask because it's

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:90%
a freewill zone area.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is of
freewill zone area.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're not allowed to
intrude unless we ask for help.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Then they come and help us.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:10%
- My research reveals that
all the Essene communities

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:10%
were ascension centers
where celestial beings found

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:10%
safe harbor and
taught humans how

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:10%
to perfect themselves and
transform into angels.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they taught humans

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:84%
how to wear their robes
of light and to ascend.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:10%
The Essenes answered
the question,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:10%
can a human become an
angel, with a specific plan

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:10%
for mass perfection or
transformation and ascension.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
ascension and perfection

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
are interchangeable
terms for the Essenes.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
perfection, scholars

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
referred to this transformation
as angelamorphism,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
or human transformation
into an angel.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Becoming an angel and ascending
is the one goal, they believe,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that takes care of all
other goals or intentions.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes claim they
possess this knowledge of how

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to make or transform
humans into holy ones

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and to change our
state of existence

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:90%
by illuminating the world.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we accept that
the Essenes were living

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
among angels and
extraterrestrials,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
the next logical question
is, who were these angels,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
or what kind of
angels were they?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
The answer is they are known
as the Angels of the Lord,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:90%
or the Watchers.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Early mystical Hebrew sects
organized these angels

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
into an archangel hierarchy.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:10%
This is the origins of the
spiritual hierarchy idea.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
According to this
system, the watchers

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
are the highest angels
possible and were ruled over

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%
by four of their own--

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the great angels known as
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael,

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and Uriel.

human being, once they

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
become like an

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:90%

us about your work in healing.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Oh, I do a lot of
sound healing and actually work

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
with the colors of the
rainbow, chakras, and--

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that your
specialty, would you say?

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Pardon?

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a
specialty of yours?

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.145 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
do sound healing.

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But I do it with the
chakras because each chakra

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
has the activational key to
open up either your centers--

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and each center is an energy
and a knowledge and a purpose.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So you're holding a lot of
knowledge and information

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And if it's blocked,
the sound will actually

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
open up and release and
clear out that chakra

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and activate you as a
full being of awareness,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because each one is
a psychic ability.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra is an awareness of
who you are, why you're here.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I also do the
22 DNA activations.

We just can't see it

It takes them on journeys,

helps them, like I said,
remember who they are,

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
why they're here,
triggers their memory,

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
healing, all kinds of
different activation.

I have an ascension CD that
raises their frequency.

Let's say, if a
person is extremely--

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%

depression, also--

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
sadness and all the
heaviness that's

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:90%
going on here on the planet--

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:90%
raises your vibration.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, I can breathe again.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead of like, oh,
this again today?

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So it raises your vibration.

>>NOORY: Well, how does the
sound affect our consciousness?

00:20:53.525 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: It's
through vibration.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
I can explain it.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to experience it.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when you do that,
what happens to the body?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: It heals.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It actually kind of puts its
cellular memory back together--

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
your cells of who you are
and your perfect status

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're bombarded
here with pollution,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
bad foods, bad water.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
That all messes up your

it, clears it out,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and rejuvenates you again
back to your true form.

- When we think about how sound
affects our consciousness,

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:10%
we have the ability, through
chanting, through meditation,

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:10%
through song, to amplify our
thoughts to a greater degree

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:10%
than perhaps most realize.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And in amplifying
our thoughts, we're

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
having a direct effect on not
only our own consciousness

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
but the consciousness
of everyone

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.635 align:middle line:90%

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:10%
- It was found that
when we use music,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:10%
it tremendously increase
our mental abilities.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So music is not
just for relaxation.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for fun.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's much more than that.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
With music, we can much easier
transform to higher states

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

are ready to march into battle
and lay down their lives.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So music affects
us dramatically.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we're-- in our culture,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
we're programmed by our music.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if we
can actually apply

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
this in a way that is directed
at navigating or directing

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%

listening or playing,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.630 align:middle line:10%
is one of the few

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:10%
the whole brain simultaneously,
as seen on an EEG scan.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
This can cause the
consciousness to harmonize

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
as we can use more of
our total brain capacity

froze it, looked
under a microscope,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.867 align:middle line:84%

tuning forks, crystal bowls,
keyboards, drumming, chimes.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
told me in 1997 when I
went to the Great Pyramids

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring my drum to
activate the pyramids.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the pyramids
have been dormant for eons.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And they said--

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then what
do they mean by that?

00:25:32.593 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: What
they needed activated

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:90%
was the generators down below.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like electric

I don't know that information.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is they said
I activated the pyramids, which

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
helped stabilize the Earth from
shifting her axes dramatically.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:90%

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back the

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I brought a group,
and we were toning.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I brought my tuning
forks at that time.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And spirit said, use the tuning
forks for heaven and Earth,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:90%
which I already--

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I know what they are-- the
keys for the heaven and Earth.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we were all
chanting and toning that keys,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and Tibetan monks
started chanting with us.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And you couldn't see them.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.098 align:middle line:90%

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.432 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That's
what I was wondering.

00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
temple guard there.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And I asked the temple guard--

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you have
speakers in here?

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:90%
You activated the pyramid.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:90%
And we all heard this--

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:90%
there was like a dozen--

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:90%
that's what it sounded like.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%

way I can describe it.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:90%

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But each one has
its own purpose.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, what
would a function be?

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Well,
basically, like I was saying,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
for activating and connecting
the Earth to the other star

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
systems-- because we
are all one, you know?

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we're not connected,
then we get separated,

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and our energy shifts.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Like the planet Earth,
it is a lower frequency.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It can actually be
a higher frequency.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But right now it's starting to
shift into a higher frequency.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So the pyramids help with that.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids,
they really stabilize

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and connection
with the other star systems.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the "Galactic
Messages" program,

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
there's an explanation about
the purposes of the pyramids.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Oh, OK.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:10%
- Some pyramids don't even
need to have complex mechanisms

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:10%
inside, as they work with
vibrational synchronicity

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:10%
reflecting and vibrating
to the same frequency

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:10%
other pyramids vibrate to.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
With that, they also
contribute to sustain

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
their planetary frequency
and also augment

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the power-producing efficiency
of those that do have

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:90%
electric components inside.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.690 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are frequency
generators placed there

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.850 align:middle line:90%
at the same time as the moon.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They have to take part on
the creation of the matrix.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:10%
But under Federation
control, they

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:10%
could be capable of removing
the lunar matrix by changing

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:10%
their frequencies and mingling
with the ones of the moon,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:10%
in a very real way
providing a way

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:10%
to control the
frequency of the Earth

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:10%
without having to go
all the way to the moon.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are the main
functions of the pyramid.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
They were built for
those specific purposes

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Also, note that
some pyramids were

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:90%
built as monuments to pyramids.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't do
much, only be there.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The true purpose of
the Great Pyramids

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is to augment the potential
of everyone who is inside them

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:90%
for interstellar travel at will.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Astral flight, with or
without the physical body,

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:90%
remains the same.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with all of that?

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Absolutely.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:90%
I was saying the--

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: --same thing.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing?

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a picture
I want you to tell us--

00:30:23.282 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:90%
it has to do with a beam.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:90%
And let's see what this is.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah, this is
actually from my Mayan CD.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.913 align:middle line:84%
When I was down the first
time in the Mayan lands--

00:30:34.913 --> 00:30:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the Mayan pyramid?

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.983 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That's
the Mayan pyramid, yeah.

00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
floating above it?

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: That is a
ship activating the pyramid.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So in 1998, when I first
went down to the Mayan lands,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:90%
that's the vision I saw.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, they're going
to be coming in 2012.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
The ships are going
to be coming in 2012

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to activate the pyramids
all over the world.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
saw, them beaming

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:90%
a light in the pyramids.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
At the same time?

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.563 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And I said this in 1998.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And it started
happening in 2011.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
A Mayan shaman saw my CD
cover in 11-11-11 conference

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I was at, and he said,
this is what's happening.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.508 align:middle line:90%
This is happening now.

00:31:18.508 --> 00:31:19.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happening.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I saw that.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I kept seeing that vision.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So then I wrote this CD and
had that picture on there

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.068 align:middle line:90%
to show the prophecy.

00:31:30.068 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Devara, what do you
have to say to our "Beyond

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:90%
wow!

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: [LAUGHS] Yeah,
well, they're here helping us.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, we have
beautiful star family,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
interfere unless we ask.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And one important
thing I want to say

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:90%
is they have been helping us.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So they said they're
going to make sure

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that we do not
blow up this planet

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.135 align:middle line:90%
like another planet in our--

00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.532 align:middle line:84%
>>THUNDERBEAT: --in
our solar system.

00:32:03.532 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:84%
They stopped the
nuclear weapons.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.980 align:middle line:90%
They dismantle them.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: They do that.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
that for a long time.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
done that before.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yes.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.801 align:middle line:10%
And there is a--

00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:10%
they were making sure that
we don't blow ourselves up

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:10%
like a planet in our
solar system called

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.647 align:middle line:10%
Maldek, which is our
asteroid belt between Mars--

00:32:23.647 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mars and Jupiter.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: --and Jupiter.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're making sure
that you guys don't do that.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, they
cannot interfere.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
They have actually helped
clean up the planet, too,

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:35.830 align:middle line:90%
of the pollution.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, in the '60s,
it was such bad pollution,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
it was killing the
planet, that they actually

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
came and helped to clean it up.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.425 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would have been
a dead planet, they told me.

00:32:46.425 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
do get involved?

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.633 align:middle line:90%
>>THUNDERBEAT: Yeah.

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Only if they have
to, but they don't

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
want to interrupt-- only
to make sure that we
