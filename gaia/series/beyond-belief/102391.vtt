00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.395 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.539 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to this edition

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with
our special guest, author

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:10%
and researcher Jim Sanders.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Jim has written several
works, of course,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
"First Strike," that he
wrote with Jack Cashill.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And of course, "The
Downing of TWA Flight 800."

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be talking
with Jim about another plane

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
crash.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We think something happened
to this one, but who knows.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:90%
"Someone Is Hiding Something."

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the title
of a book that I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
wrote with Richard
Belzer and David Wayne.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they were well
into this book theory,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and then they heard several of
my theories on "Coast-to-Coast

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
AM" and brought me in to kind
of finish up the project.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.839 align:middle line:84%
And Jim, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:09.171 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM SANDERS: Great to be here.

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've been talking
with you extensively

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
over a year about this missing
Malaysian Flight MH370.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You and I have had our
own theories of what

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:90%
we think may have happened.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But let's do a
little review, Jim.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
On March 8th, a Boeing 770
was leaving Kuala Lumpur

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:90%
heading for Beijing.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Into the flight very early,
something very strange

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:10%
Somebody or something
shut off communications

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:10%
and everything else, and the
plane was nowhere to be found.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:10%
They know that it flew for
hours all over the place,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:10%
over the Indian Ocean,
back down, over.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:10%
And so here we are today.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about this thing.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is going on?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:90%
They still haven't found it.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Your best story is
the first one that

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:10%
came out by the head of
the Malaysian Air Force.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
He came on and said
everything that you've said,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and that it turned back around
and came back over Malaysia,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.601 align:middle line:84%
and was last tracked by military
radar headed west-- generally

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:90%
west.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Generally, yeah.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: That could be--
but you go look at a map

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's somewhere
between Somalia and Yemen

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:90%
if you stayed on course there.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Now within 24 hours, the
strangest thing happened.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what the Air
Force generals said

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:84%
would lead one to the
logical conclusion

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
that it was a terrorist act.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: The prime
minister of that country

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
viciously attacks in public
that Air Force general,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and basically says the guy
is a lying fool and an idiot,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:90%
because nothing he said is true.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the point that,
after all my years--

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
30 years' experience
now-- of working

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.857 align:middle line:84%
against the federal government
and seeing what happens when

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:07.065 align:middle line:84%
there's a vested interest--
I don't have to know what

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:09.965 align:middle line:84%
the vested interest is, I just
have to know what the acts are

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:10.965 align:middle line:90%
that are going on.

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that prime
minister turned on the general,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.859 align:middle line:84%
I knew that American
intelligence, probably

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:16.775 align:middle line:90%
British intelligence--

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had gotten to him.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.501 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Gotten to him.

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And in all probability,
Mossad, because they

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
had a vital interest in any
plane headed to that area.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The title of our book,
"Someone Is Hiding Something,"

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
came from the former Prime
Minister of Malaysia, who

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
said basically-- and
those were his words--

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
planes either land
or they crash,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:90%
but they don't just disappear.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Someone is hiding something.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So he--

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: He came partway back.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm surprised they
were able to keep him

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that much on course, because
he had to feel like a fool

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
after getting all
that pressure on him

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
and attacking his own general.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And politically, who knows
what the ramifications were.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.548 align:middle line:84%
I really don't, but they
were certainly severe.

00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And here we are a year later.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
We saw what happened a few
months ago with the downed

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
AirAsia flight, where pieces
were floating in the ocean,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
bodies were floating
in the ocean.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And they found it
relatively quickly.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Why in this particular case
can't they seem to find it?

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got a
number of scenarios

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that I want to throw your way
and get your opinion on that.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But with all our technology,
with all our capabilities,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
they can't find one
shred of evidence.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well
they can, they just

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
haven't publicly admitted it.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
As I was developing my
theories, and particularly

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in our early
conversations-- it developed

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
over a period of weeks as
things were coming out,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and we were analyzing
them-- I took all that

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to a retired Air Force
Intelligence colonel,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean a really top guy,
and laid it out to him.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said well one
thing is for certain,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:90%
that plane didn't disappear.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
That plane cannot disappear from
the world with the technology

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
you've told me,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
yes, in all my
years of experience,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:90%
it has the ring of truth to it.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's the basis I
was operating on when

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:90%
we were talking all that time.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Our theories-- and we came
up with nine theories,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I won't go through all of
them-- some of the obvious ones

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:90%
were was weather involved?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty good evening.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:90%
What about a hijacking?

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Well let's see now, two
people got aboard that plane

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
with stolen passports.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
That's strange all by itself.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.855 align:middle line:90%
Possibility?

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: It's a possibility.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But as you go
through the analysis,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the overwhelming probability
is that one-- at least one

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
of those two pilots was
involved in the scheme.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
It would be very difficult--

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.419 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One would think that.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, that's--

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody had to shut
off the communications device.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Exactly.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that knew what those
pilots knew, if it wasn't them,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
how that plane functioned
to a high degree.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Suicide?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
We ruled that out
very early in, Jim,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because I figure
this plane's not

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
going to fly around for six
to seven hours after the fact.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
If it's a suicide mission, he's
going to plunge it right away.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.202 align:middle line:90%
So we ruled that out.

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the only possible
way that that could even

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.885 align:middle line:84%
come into play is if one of
them had been pining for,

00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
oh, the last thing I want to see
before I crash into the ocean

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.535 align:middle line:90%
is an iceberg.

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Otherwise, no.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Virtually impossible.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some kind of
malfunction of the cockpit.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
on that plane,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
a fire or something that killed
off the pilots right away?

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I find that a little
doubtful, too.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Because of the
sequence of events shutting off

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the electronic things that
needed to be shut off so that

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.865 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't be tracked
as easily, that--

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the strange part.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: That
simply is so unlikely.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see a
mathematician work on that one.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But I would make
an educated guess

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.074 align:middle line:84%
that that's less than one
millionth of 1% of a chance.

00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there was
never any communication

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of, "oh my god, something's
wrong here, we're going down,"

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.365 align:middle line:90%
It was deliberate.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: None of those.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And first it climbs,
which would suggest.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.969 align:middle line:84%
"OK, we're at least going to
deprive the passengers of air

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
long enough so we don't
have to worry about them,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have enough
people to control them."

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And whether that
killed them off, I don't know,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's not really relevant.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes down to
a more sustainable level.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, the
crew has access to oxygen

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that the passengers don't
necessarily have access to.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes down to
a fairly low altitude,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:10%
and is actually-- according
to witness accounts--

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:10%
is actually seen flying at
a rather low altitude back

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:10%
across Malaysia before it
hangs right and heads west

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:10%
towards either the
Middle East or Africa.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
it flew around for so long?

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well to me, it seems
reasonably logical for them

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to come down over Malaysia,
head out at what appears to be

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.824 align:middle line:84%
a fairly low altitude-- because
in that part of the world,

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:90%
you don't have--

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To try to
hide from radar, right?

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Hide from radar,
and they would certainly

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
have had easy access to
whatever capabilities

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Malaysia and the surrounding
areas would have.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And that certainly wouldn't
be-- in terms of air--

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and that wouldn't be much,
because that's simply

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
not an area of the world
where fighter aircraft are

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:90%
in big demand.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:10%
And it's seen heading west
last, hundreds of miles

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:10%
past the point where the coverup
story, which was the satellite,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.422 align:middle line:10%
came from.

00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:10%
Which makes the satellite
story virtually impossible.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.699 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody
wanted to take this plane

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and use it later for
a bomb, to ram it

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:90%
into a building or something.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Where would they put that?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.365 align:middle line:90%
Yemen?

00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:01.865 align:middle line:90%
Somalia?

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yemen or Somalia.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.059 align:middle line:84%
Yemen, of course, is a hotbed of
ISIS, ISOL, whichever name you

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
want to use for it.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Al-Shabaab is
out there in Somalia.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And
now Somalia, let's

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
see what's happened there.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:90%
This is not even a year past.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And Somalia, I did
enough research

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to know that there
were a lot of old,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
abandoned airstrips, that
in that part of the world

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
the airstrips were perfectly
viable after decades

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that a plane like
that could land.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember, it
was an extended range version.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So you fill-- passengers,
luggage, everything

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't need is off, you
can fill that sucker up

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
with explosives and
fill it up with fuel,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
it could hit any
point in the world.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:90%
In the world.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And in a big way, too.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: In a big way.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Israel, any place.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Israel,
of course, had

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to be going nuts, because a
777, that is something that

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
could devastate their
nuclear facility,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
or-- I have no idea
what it would be,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
but you know that
they would really

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.257 align:middle line:84%
be making a major
effort on this,

00:10:04.257 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and the United States
right along with them.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Diego Garcia is in
the central Indian Ocean.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It, one,
has the capability

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:10%
of accepting a plane
there-- or we've also

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:10%
got the ability to
launch planes there

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:10%
if we had to attack a
plane and take it down.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume for a moment that
our government and governments

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
said there's something
wrong with this plane.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's being stolen.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
It's been taken.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
land it somewhere.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We have one of two
things we can do.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We can blow it up,
or we can let it land

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and then take the
consequences after that.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Which of those two scenarios do
you think is the most likely?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Take it out
is the most likely.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Trying to get it
to land, you have

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to have the assets in the area
to at least tail it until it

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:90%
gets to where it's going.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.316 align:middle line:84%
And then what are
you going to do?

00:11:02.316 --> 00:11:05.382 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have a
team ready to try to go in.

00:11:05.382 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then what do
you do with the passengers,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
know if they're

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:90%
dead or alive at that point.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Another good reason
why they searched north,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
south, and east but not
west is because that plane

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.554 align:middle line:84%
was such a lethal
possibility that if you're

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:84%
going to take it
out, you're going

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to take it out with a missile.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't
have the niceties

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of bringing in a couple of SEAL
teams to manage the situation

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and get the people away
before-- and that simply

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a viable way,
without spending weeks

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.037 align:middle line:90%
trying to get ready to do it.

00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's even assume that they're
down to where they could really

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:90%
do it in a couple of weeks.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be totally
unacceptable to leave

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that plane in the
control of people

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that can hit any part of the
world they want-- and Israel

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't
going to let that happen.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.625 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: No,
absolutely not going to.

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And we had at least three of our
most advanced Aegis destroyers

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and cruisers out in the Indian
Ocean in that area that night.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Any one of them could
have taken the plane out.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think,
since 9/11, Jim,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the procedure probably is
if a plane is hijacked,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:90%
we take it down.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't let it land, we don't
let it crash into something,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
we take it down.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what happened
in Pennsylvania, with one

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:90%
of those four planes.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We probably had
to do that, but I

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:90%
think that's the procedure now.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.209 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: I believe so.

00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:10%
You're-- Pennsylvania, I did a
lot of investigating about it

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:10%
and came very close to
writing a book about it.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
no doubt that

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
was taken out with a missile.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Without any question.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.519 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean those
heroes on the plane,

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
they probably-- they
did what they had to do.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.997 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: They did what they
had to do, and when the--

00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's roll.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: When the vice
president gave the go order

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
to shoot it down, they didn't
know all of the heroism going

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.551 align:middle line:90%
on in that plane.

00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: So what a huge
embarrassment that would've

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:90%
been, too.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.014 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: But politics--
all these decisions,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
they're not made on what we as
mere citizens of this country

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
would-- our logic
isn't their logic.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Their logic is power.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:18.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you think
knows that MH370 was shot down?

00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Oh, within
our intelligence system

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and-- well I know for a
fact that, well, according

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.947 align:middle line:84%
to journalism-- MI6, American
intelligence, the Mossad.

00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They would all know.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all know.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.147 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yes.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all
have kept it quiet.

00:13:35.855 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.849 align:middle line:84%
Particularly when you get
to the Mossad and MI6,

00:13:40.849 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
those things don't
leak like a sieve.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The question is,
was the pilot involved?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Or did somebody break into that
cockpit and know what to do?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Shut off communications
and fly the plane.

00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:57.876 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: The high
probability is that the pilot--

00:13:57.876 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of them.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.749 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: Was involved.

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:10%
At least one of them, yeah.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:10%
And there's no reason to--

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And may have killed
his co-pilot, let's say.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.281 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:14:04.281 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Something along those lines.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
That if you just take all
the possible scenarios

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and reduce them to a logic--

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nice
common denominator.

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And that one comes up,
in my opinion, well

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
over 90% probability that
that's exactly what happened.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think when you
weigh all possibilities,

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.555 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at
the simplest solution,

00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:30.114 align:middle line:90%
the simple possibility.

00:14:30.114 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's that.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.446 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And we know really
beyond any doubt,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
as you look at how everything
progressed, that intelligence

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
was-- in other words,
power structure--

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
was manipulating what
was going on there.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
watching CNN, there's

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:90%
a power structure behind that.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:53.585 align:middle line:84%
But let's face it, CNN is not
really a news organization.

00:14:53.585 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
say, then-- as I've

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:84%
said-- where are the
pieces of the plane?

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Where are the bodies?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
If they shot it down,
one, they won't tell us.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Two, they've already scooped up
whatever they could scoop up.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And
that's precisely why

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it landed before
they nailed it with a missile,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
because if it had hit
the water, they really

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
would have had to get in
there with lots of ships

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and do a major cleanup.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that takes it outside
the realm of serious logic.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But you blow it up--
and in my opinion,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
it was blown up with
a good-sized missile,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:90%
because if they hadn't--

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like disintegrated.

00:15:35.386 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if they'd have
been able to find pieces

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.346 align:middle line:84%
that they could salt
the bottom of the ocean

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
with to say oh, there it is, we
don't know where the rest of it

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:84%
is, but gee, we've
solved the problem.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have
pieces down there that

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
aren't so transparently
burned to a crisp and bent

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:58.335 align:middle line:84%
and blown by an explosive
event that you can do that.

00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where are we with
aviation these days, Jim,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's going on?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Aviation is
in for some real trials

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:90%
and tribulations.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I would be
hard-pressed to believe

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that somewhere along the line
with the financial abilities--

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and apparently the
ISIS-type people

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
are becoming so sophisticated
that more losses have

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to be expected unless they
find another way to make

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:90%
a major statement.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But what more major
statement could ISIS

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
make, or any other organization
with their sophistication

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and finances make, and
not use a plane to do it?

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems to
be planes are the way

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.245 align:middle line:90%
to do it these days.

00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they might try some
other ways but you know subways

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and shopping centers, that--
horrendous as it is for those

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that are the victims of that,
that's-- in terms of power,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.065 align:middle line:90%
that's just peanuts.

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are not
reporting what you and I have

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:90%
been talking about.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well with CNN, it's
just very easily manipulated.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
I go back to my own
personal experience,

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and I observed how
the New York Times

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.070 align:middle line:84%
was manipulated by the FBI
and Justice Department--

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On 800.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: On TWA 800.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.562 align:middle line:84%
Because the FBI really
wanted to call it a bomb so

00:17:28.562 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that they could at least
shut down the investigation.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They'd throw everybody else
out and come up with a scenario

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that, well OK, that's
not the right one,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
but at least they
got in the ballpark

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and they could name
some bad guys--

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were close.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that
they didn't know,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
but that's-- they being at
the top end didn't know--

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
but they did want to come up
with some bad guys for it.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when
politics, power got involved.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:90%
That was the New York Times.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%
NBC was in bed with the NTSB.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
They pushed the mechanical
theory early on.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So here you see all this
manipulation of the media.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The media can no
longer be believed

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
in anything in which there
is a strong possibility

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that the government might
have a vested interest.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And not just the government
but a power structure

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that is closely attached to
one side of the ongoing issue

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:90%
of power in Washington, DC.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it happen--
I watched them track me

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.212 align:middle line:84%
through the National
Archives to try to get--

00:18:37.212 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and the national
archivists were the ones

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that told me about this--
to figure out where I was

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
going so they could stop me.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a retired army
colonel telling me Sanders,

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.685 align:middle line:84%
you're the first journalist--
the only journalist-- to,

00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and in his words,
pierce the veil.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
That was in the summer
of 1997, before my wife

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and I were indicted.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.181 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have any regrets
that you pierced the veil?

00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh my goodness, no.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
My only regret is that I
didn't have the staying

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.745 align:middle line:84%
power financially to
stay with those guys--

00:19:08.745 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And fight it.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: And fight it.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we sold our house.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.622 align:middle line:90%
We had to sell off her 401Ks--

00:19:14.622 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They almost
destroyed you financially.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It's-- we're just now almost to
where we will have a positive

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of negative
in terms of net worth.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Where instead of being
retired like most people would

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
at my age, I mean have a
home paid for and really just

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
a really nice
retirement, but no.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
When you get that-- when
I got that far into it--

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
because the only real job I
ever had was in law enforcement.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
In California.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.752 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of have a
special-- most civilians,

00:19:51.752 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
there's no special
thing with them.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Go vote every couple of
years and do all that.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But with the knowledge I
gained as a police officer,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and then I worked in
politics for five years.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So I saw it from the inside.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.449 align:middle line:90%
On both sides.

00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: On both sides.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
into journalism.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And each step of the way, it
kind of built my expertise

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:90%
in how things really function.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.489 align:middle line:84%
And how many people are
there like me out there?

00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:90%
There are not many.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's not a lot.

00:20:20.405 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Technology, Jim,
continues to change.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And now there's fear that they
can get special kinds of bombs

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:90%
on planes that are undetectable.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that a real possibility?

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if it does,
it changes the game.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well American 587,
about 60 days after 9/11,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:84%
crashed for air
turbulence reasons.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.124 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:45.124 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
That was a bomb that
hadn't been detected.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:90%
100% guarantee.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was said
about that was a lie.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I got a little tete-a-tete
with the State Department

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:84%
when Colin Powell was Secretary
of State at that time.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.385 align:middle line:84%
So I went on air-- and I kind
of regret doing this now,

00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
because he's a pretty decent
person as far as I can tell,

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:90%
being in that life anyway--

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was one
of the good guys.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
He was as good as
you can get in there.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I made fun of
him for tripping over

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
the wires of the
media trying to get

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.246 align:middle line:84%
to the press room in the State
Department before the police--

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he was--

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.578 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Actually
got to the site

00:21:23.578 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and say that there was no reason
to believe it was a terrorism.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
ticked when he had

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to go out and talk about
Iraq and the weapons

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:90%
of mass destruction.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:90%
He really felt used, I think.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.283 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, you
could pretty much

00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:90%
tell that at the time.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do you think with
this technology that continues

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
to change, I mean, how can
TSA, how can people like that

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
fight this to protect
our safety when we fly?

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well that's why more
and more of the freedoms that

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
we love to talk about so much
and don't spend a lot of time

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect, that's
why they're being taken away,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:90%
just like--

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little bit at a time.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.593 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: The high
school experiment.

00:22:03.593 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, put the frog on the
pan, turn the fire on fast,

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:08.925 align:middle line:90%
and it jumps off.

00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Turn the fire on and
slowly increase it,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
and it cooks itself to death.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going
on with us now.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
even knowing it.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And that is exactly
what's going on right now.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're trying
to control the internet,

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
because they know that's
an area that you have

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to control if you're
going to implement

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.885 align:middle line:90%
some of these other programs.

00:22:27.885 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, I will say
I legally obtained

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.845 align:middle line:84%
some very damning
military documents

00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of a study that was done on
how to control the internet.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
That was just in 2004, they
were waking up to the fact.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
says, we used to be

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.484 align:middle line:84%
able to go to the
major networks,

00:22:48.484 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and we could cut
a deal with them.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just flip, yeah.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.506 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:22:51.506 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And now it's all about--
since there's dozens

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and soon to be hundreds of
credible voices out there,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:90%
so it's all about credibility.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And we-- this study
is to learn how

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to discredit them on one
hand and up our credibility.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.921 align:middle line:84%
There was a-- money has been
devoted to this program.

00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's at least in the
hundreds of millions, probably

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:84%
billions by now,
to when somebody

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
gets on there with something
that they can't live with--

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They shut them down.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.591 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: They shut them down.

00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an ad hoc.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a day-to-day operation.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what they want.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.464 align:middle line:84%
They really believe that
they need to do that.

00:23:32.464 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're not
going to stop until they do it

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and pull this off.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh, absolutely not.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We lost-- for reasons
that I'll write about

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
in the coming years, we lost
the republic December 7, 1941.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost any--
democracy does not

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
exist in any meaningful form
in this country anymore.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought we
lost it November 22, 1963,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.817 align:middle line:90%
but you're right.

00:23:59.817 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a little bit before that.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: If I get
the book published,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.301 align:middle line:90%
you'll agree with me, I'm sure.

00:24:03.301 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is the end--
when JFK was taken out,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.155 align:middle line:84%
that was the end of a long
process that began in 1940.

00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when
you look at what's

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
happening technologically--
social networking,

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the internet, worldwide
situation, the Arab Spring

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
of a few years ago primarily
because of the ability

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to Twitter and get
back to each other--

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.454 align:middle line:84%
if you were running government
today as an elected official,

00:24:28.454 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
would you want to put
a control on that?

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Once you've
gotten to a certain level,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:90%
you can't just abandon it.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
dialing it back.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking as a leader now.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:90%
You start to dial it back.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.556 align:middle line:90%
And how that process--

00:24:43.556 --> 00:24:46.292 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you know
how dangerous it can be.

00:24:46.292 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the right hands.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:90%
In the right hands.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
If the population gets to
a point where they say,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
"we're not going to
take it anymore,"

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
then governments have a problem.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
you're right; they

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.802 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to turn
that dial back down.

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.051 align:middle line:84%
But being able-- a
leader-- to do it,

00:25:05.051 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anybody
that's likely to win

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
this next time around,
assuming Hillary doesn't win.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But I do see some younger people
coming up that have the time.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
believe that there

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
are people in the
Congress right now

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that could start that
process if allowed to.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So usually
what happens-- in China,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:84%
somebody criticizes
a form of government,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and they go and shut him down,
or they go and take him away.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
freely in North Korea.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't attack the
administration on the internet

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and expect to get through.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Here, we still have some
incredible freedoms about that.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people basically
have said anything

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they want about anybody
on the internet.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.479 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe I
see the day that that's

00:25:55.479 --> 00:25:56.145 align:middle line:90%
going to change.

00:25:56.145 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well plus, you do
have a federal government that

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is committed to damaging
freedom of speech

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
by discrediting credible
people that oppose them.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's how the system works.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And any congressman who has
risen high enough quickly

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
enough to be at an age,
they know that they can only

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
go a little tiny distance.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, bad things--
because as far as I know,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.667 align:middle line:90%
there's no saints in Congress.

00:26:28.667 --> 00:26:30.500 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of stuff,
plenty of baggage--

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.791 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well maybe one or two.

00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:90%
In there.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And almost-- not almost.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can be stopped if this
power structure that we now

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
have decides they
need to be stopped.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, if people
want to track your work,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.976 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well there's
a good question,

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
because I do not have an
internet site right now.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll have to
go to amazon.com and type

00:26:51.685 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:90%
in your name, right?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.153 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: It'll probably
be about two years

00:26:54.153 --> 00:26:57.117 align:middle line:10%
before I bring a site back
up again as meaningful stuff.

00:26:57.117 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, they're going to have
to listen to me on your show.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great, thanks, Jim.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.734 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Nice being here.

00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know what,
this LA studio here is nice,

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's convenient,
and it functions.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:10%
But what really
functions, people

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:10%
like Jim Sanders, who
stick their neck out

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:10%
to try to bring you the truth.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank you
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:33.717 align:middle line:90%
