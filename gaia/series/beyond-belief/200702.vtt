>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Mark Stavish is our guest,
internationally best-selling

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
author of close to 30 books now
on spirituality and self-help.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
He is also the
founder and Director

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:10%
of the Studies for the
Institute for Hermetic Studies.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Mark.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK STAVISH:
George, thank you.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.277 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hermetic studies.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:90%
What are hermetic studies?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's simply
traditional, Western, esoteric

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual studies.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Most people are familiar with it
in terms of not only meditation

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:10%
and symbolism, but also,
to some degree, astrology,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:10%
or what they might have heard
in terms of alchemy or Qabala.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's just all
encompassed under that.

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's just
an umbrella term that

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.663 align:middle line:90%
covers all of those studies.

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:10%
And it generally
relates to those things

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:10%
which mostly come from Egypt--

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
Hermes, Egyptian god Hermes--

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.742 align:middle line:10%
and the Middle East in
general, but also into Europe,

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:10%
through the Middle Ages and
the Renaissance to the present.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What led you
in that direction?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I've
always been around it.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:84%
My family, or part of my family,
I should say, came from an area

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
in Eastern Europe, more
was at that time Germany,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
around the turn of the
century, early 1900s.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And that area was very
rich in esoteric practices.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.175 align:middle line:84%
So my great
grandfather, and folks

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
before him, and my great
uncle, and to some degree,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.205 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother, always had some
interest in this and practice.

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you also got
involved in your interest

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
in lucid dreaming.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lucid
dreaming, of course,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
means a dream that you know
you're in a dream, right?

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, often, when we
dream, we simply fall asleep,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
we have a dream, and
we believe it's real,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.802 align:middle line:90%
and we act accordingly.

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We're getting chased
by a giant elephant,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're in a terror,
and we wake up, and--

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.856 align:middle line:90%
[GASPING]

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait, it wasn't real.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank God.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Thank
God it wasn't real.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And then as we experience
greater levels of lucidity

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
in our own mind, in our
own thinking process,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
in our own experience
of life, that

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
moves forward not just
in a day-to-day state,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.768 align:middle line:90%
but into our dream state.

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we have those
moments of lucidity,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
where our body is completely
at rest and asleep,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:90%
but we're awake in our own mind.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:10%
This is how my mind
functions, and it's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:10%
producing these dreams
and these scenarios for us

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:10%
that we know their dreams, but
they have meaning and value.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They're a teaching
mechanism of sorts.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can actually change
the outcome of a lucid dream

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.787 align:middle line:90%
because you know you're one.

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's correct.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Now it takes effort.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always--

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's practice.

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It doesn't
always happen easily.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I have many humorous stories
from people who thought,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, this is a dream,
so I can do anything.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of sort of works.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Probably the funniest
one for myself

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is I was having this
fantastic lucid dream.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you want to
check the boundaries of it.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So you do things
that aren't natural,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
things you wouldn't
do in normal life--

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to make that clear.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to see
if it's a dream, right?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's to
see if it's a dream.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well,
if this is a dream,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and it is, then this
shouldn't hurt, right?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I do this wonderful thing
to my hand, and I wake up,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
and my hand is in terrible pain.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So there, we have
an illustration

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of the mind-body connection too.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: OK?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
That what happens in
our mind has an effect

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:90%
somehow on our physiology.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we have
so many different kinds

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:90%
of dreams, Mark?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:90%
We have lucid dreaming.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
We have precognitive dreams.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%
We have self-healing dreams.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
We have dreams of
our departed ones.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have so
many different kinds?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%
We have nightmares.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: All of these are a
reflection of our level of--

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it mental integration
or spiritual awakening.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.868 align:middle line:84%
And we go through daily
life often very confused.

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't recognize it as
such, but it's confused.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:90%
So our dreams reflect that.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And for people who undertake,
or are beginning to undertake,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
or are being pushed in a
direction of a spiritual path,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that's when you see the
dream life often changes.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I met a fellow here
yesterday, in Boulder,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
who said that he was an
atheist, a young guy.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And he had this
experience, and it was just

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
so powerful and overwhelming
that he just packed everything

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
up, moved out here to Boulder.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now
he's a believer.

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:32.025 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And those breakthroughs,
those kind of breakthroughs

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
can happen to people.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't always, but they can.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Often, it's more subtle.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates
the lucid dream?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's a tough one.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when we
look at the process,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just a greater level
of mental self-awareness.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
What we would call it
is a greater integration

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment or inner
illumination, inner awareness.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:57.247 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that comes
and goes with people.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to be
more integrated,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, we're really good
at it, sometimes, we're not.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But as we practice,
and we meditate,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
or we undertake
a spiritual path,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and there's greater
levels of relaxation--

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that might be the
operative word, is relaxation.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a mental
relaxation where

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.805 align:middle line:84%
we're willing to engage all
those things in our own mind

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
so that the nightmares aren't
really frightening anymore.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:90%
The nightmares are a challenge.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They're more like a horror
movie that we watch on TV.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.657 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, many people
do watch horror movies on TV,

00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and you see they get frightened.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to go to bed.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.217 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They don't
want to go to bed.

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
This is that same thing,
except it's in your own mind,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're working out
some kind of trauma,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
or fear, or anxiety,
or creative process.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lucid dreaming,
when it happens, is

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:90%
kind of enlightening, isn't it?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You have that kind of euphoric
feeling that you're in a dream,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and you know you're dreaming.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes, and
that's the beauty of it.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It's unequivocal.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
You know it because it's a
direct personal experience

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.805 align:middle line:84%
of the clarity, to some
degree, of your own mind.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
history of great scientific

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
breakthroughs, when you
look at a lot of folks,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
they talk about how the
breakthrough came through

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:90%
in a dream.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:10%
When you look at the great
manuscripts of spirituality--

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:10%
perfect example is
"The Chemical Wedding

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:10%
of Christian Rosenkreutz."

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:10%
In the opening chapter, our
hero, Christian Rosenkreutz,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:10%
falls asleep and has a dream
in which an angel comes to him

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.595 align:middle line:10%
and takes him on this journey.

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
that happened.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, and again,
and again, we see that.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So whether the angel was
a actual other entity,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's their own
higher self, doesn't matter.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that a whole
revelation or unfolding is

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
taking place with that person.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark,
based on the kinds

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of dreams I've been having,
whether they're lucid dreaming

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
or just dreams in general,
they seem to be, at least

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
time, to be short.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, like 15 or 20 seconds.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what I remember
when I wake up.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Why are they so short?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:90%
They got to be longer than that.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think it has to do
with how we process information

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
That when you look at the
average person's concentration

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
span, it's very short.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And then you look
at your own concentration span,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably better,
but it's relatively short.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:10%
So a part of our
mind knows, we've

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:10%
got to deliver the message, and
it's got to be memorable now.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's like holding
up a giant stop sign.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Not telling you why to stop.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just big, and red, and says
"stop," and you hit the brakes.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
That's probably what is
going on within our own mind.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.815 align:middle line:84%
It is condensing everything
down to the most efficient,

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
the most efficient use
of time and communication

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in information that we can get.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a powerful tool.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I've had an opportunity
to interview

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of remote viewers on the
radio show and "Beyond Belief,"

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
one, of course, was
Julia Mossbridge, who

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is a remote viewer and a
precognition researcher.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.167 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:10%
>>JULIA MOSSBRIDGE:
I've now realized,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:10%
through practicing
remote viewing,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:10%
that it's a lot like meditation.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I was just going
to ask you about meditation.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:10%
I think if you get into
that meditative state,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:10%
you have a better
ability to do what we've

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:10%
been talking about
with precognition

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:10%
and remote viewing, don't you?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's a
period called cool down

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.343 align:middle line:10%
before you start your remote
viewing where you basically

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:10%
meditate.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:10%
And it definitely seems to help.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:10%
But the remote viewing
itself feels like meditation

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:10%
because you're really
watching your mind.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.757 align:middle line:10%
It's almost as if there's a
movie screen inside of you.

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:10%
At least this is my experience.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:44.245 align:middle line:10%
And you see, and hear, and
taste, and touch things.

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:10%
But if you're not observing,
if you're not observing,

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.823 align:middle line:10%
you can't report correctly.

00:08:48.823 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree?

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It's meditation too?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: 100%.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: And I think what
we have to look at is--

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.687 align:middle line:10%
what's really going on here
is, too often, in the West,

00:08:58.687 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:10%
whether it's been
with remote viewing,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:10%
or different schools of occult
thought or esoteric thought,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:10%
we look at things
very discreetly.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's a connection, a
continuum, between meditation,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
understanding our own mind,
quality of our dreams,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
our dream state,
lucid dreaming, what

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
we call out-of-body
experiences, and then

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, the quality
of afterlife survival.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuum.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It is not discrete experiences.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I wrote
about in "Between the Gates,"

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:10%
is to explore that
and explain that.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:10%
And later on, after
I'd written the book,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:10%
I came across writings within
Tibetan Buddhism, particularly

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Vajrayana and their dream
yogas, as they call it,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:10%
and that's what was said
there, that it's a continuum.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So what she stated here
about the idea of the screen,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:90%
that's not simply a metaphor.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:90%
That is an actual experience.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have that experience as
if you were looking at a screen

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and watching things happen.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very real that way.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
in some symbolism.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And some Taoist
priests, on their hats,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:10%
they have a little white
square on their forehead.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:10%
And that's symbolic of
that notion of you're

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:10%
watching the screen
of the psychic mind

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:10%
or whatever is happening
unfold before you.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, can you train
yourself to have a lucid dream?

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Meditation?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Meditation is the
best thing because it comes

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:90%
down to being able to relax.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Just relax, as she
said, and observe.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So the more you can relax
and observe, right here,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
as we're sitting, or as
you can relax and observe

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in your
own mind as you sit here,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
you just transfer
that right over.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.543 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, but it transfers
over, piece by piece,

00:10:37.543 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:90%
into your dream state.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to think
about the dream or something

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:90%
before you go to bed?

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's very
important that you cultivate

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the strong desire, the
intention, that tonight, I

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
will dream, I will become
aware that I am dreaming,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and I will take
control of my dreams,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and I will remember
them upon awakening.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
that you undertake

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:90%
that four-step process.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can say it
exactly as I just did.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
You can just repeat it to
yourself as an affirmation over

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, you're
training your mind

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to recognize itself,
and affirmations

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:90%
are a powerful tool for them.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is an
amazing tool, isn't it?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Oh, it's
just fantastic.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Look, people don't have
lucid dreams every night.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.787 align:middle line:90%
It would be nice if we did.

00:11:28.787 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It'd be nice if we had
these fantastic out-of-body

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:90%
experiences every night.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:90%
We often don't.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But we have them, and
we can cultivate them,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and we can apply them to make
our lives more productive, more

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
joyous, and just
better for everyone.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some dreams
rememberable and others are

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%
not?

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:84%
There are many nights I don't
remember my dreams at all.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
it just has to do

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
with importance a lot of our
dreams are just processing.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've been
times in your life

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
when you've gone
through the day,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
talking to yourself
over something.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Something happened,
and it's frustrating,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself
even talking out loud.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You say, I don't
want to go crazy.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
I got to stop this.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So just as we ruminate
as we're awake,

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:90%
we ruminate as we're asleep.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.692 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
a purging process,

00:12:15.692 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't really matter.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like deleting files.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Whereas
the new file, that's

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:90%
the one we got to remember.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The new process, the
new understanding,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the new way of
expressing ourselves,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that has an emotional
impact on us,

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and that's why we remember it.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw a guy talking
to himself a couple weeks ago,

00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:35.245 align:middle line:84%
and I thought he was absolutely
nuts, until I realized

00:12:35.245 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
he had a little
earpiece in, and he had

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:90%
his cell phone in his pocket.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.885 align:middle line:84%
That's happening
a lot these days.

00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And it's
funny, we laugh about it,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
but that kind of
distraction that we often

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
have in day-to-day life,
that constant distraction

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
is antithetical to
spiritual awakening.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn
to disengage, and learn

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.155 align:middle line:84%
to relax, and go within,
and observe our own mind,

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and then all these
skills happen.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Now many of these skills
will happen spontaneously

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and naturally, whether
it's remote viewing,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
astral projection,
or lucid dreaming.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates the
lucid dreaming as opposed

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:90%
to just a regular dream?

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I have
regular dreams, Mark--

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe you can
explain this for me.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning just
talking to you.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:90%
I feel as if I never see myself.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't see my hands.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm looking in a
window at whatever's happening.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how my dreams are.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming is
a little different.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel a little
bit more involved,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
but I still don't see
George in the dream.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
that because when

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
we're having a regular
dream, the stimulation

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to our psyche that's
causing the dream

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
is coming mostly from
the external world,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:90%
from day-to-day experience.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So it moves in, our
senses experience it,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
our brain somehow processes
it, and that information

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.462 align:middle line:84%
gets stored away, we'll
say, in the subconscious.

00:14:07.462 --> 00:14:08.262 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: OK.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the
subconscious at night

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
tries to sort this out
and boom-- crazy dream.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
When we're having
a lucid dream, it's

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
coming from mostly the
opposite direction.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
what we would think

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
of as our higher self, our
inner self, our divine self.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving from that
way into the subconscious,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
creating an experience,
an environment

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
that we will remember.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it moves forward
into the waking state where

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we go, oh, OK, and we
can have some sense of it

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and process it.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us some techniques
to create more lucid dreaming.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Best
one, of course, is

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
undertake a spiritual practice
of relaxation and meditation,

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just for a few
minutes a day, several times

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it have to
be before you go to bed?

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, when you're
going to sleep, just relax.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier,
focus on this idea

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that, tonight, I will dream,
I will recognize that I'm

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.925 align:middle line:84%
dreaming, I will remember my
dreams upon awakening-- oh, I

00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
will recognize I'm dreaming,
I'll take control of my dreams,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I will remember
them upon awakening.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you can
add in visualizations.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now some traditional
visualizations

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
have to do with psychic
centers, so we can add those in.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The easiest one is,
of course, the heart.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.335 align:middle line:84%
They say meditate on
the heart, and visualize

00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
a brilliant,
glowing light there,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
as if you are falling asleep in
the lap of a spiritual teacher

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
or a person that you admire.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.065 align:middle line:90%
Again, trust in relaxation.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
When you visualize
this, though--

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is critical
for people--

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
you want to visualize this
brilliant, brilliant light so

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
bright that it's as if it fills
the room you're sleeping in.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed when I've spoken
to people, if they just

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.098 align:middle line:84%
do the affirmations and
focus on their heart,

00:15:57.098 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
they'll probably
have the experience.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But if they visualize
the light as this giant

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
sphere surrounding
their room even--

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:90%
bigger, brighter the better--

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that will help trigger it.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I've asked people,
and we've talked about it,

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with the
very words we use--

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
enlightenment,
illumination, lucidity.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the act of
visualizing clarity

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that helps to stimulate the
clarity in our own mind.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you just practice
that, and same thing

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:90%
with your language.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The language is affirmative,
it's definitive,

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and yet, it's relaxed.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And here are
some more techniques

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.993 align:middle line:90%
for getting into lucid dreaming.

00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The first thing

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
is one has to realize
they're dreaming.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And let's talk
about a couple techniques

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you give people,
because they have

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
some homework in
your waking hours

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
in order to get to this place.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It does.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think, like you
said, find that awareness.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:10%
And it is a bit
of a tricky game,

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:10%
especially if you've
never had a lucid dream,

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:10%
and you're trying to essentially
become aware of something

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:10%
where you're not actually
currently aware while you're

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:10%
in it.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:10%
So all the techniques really
stem from manipulating our mind

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:10%
or focusing our mind
to detect the dream

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:10%
state without us being
consciously aware of it yet.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as we can
detect it, well then,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:10%
you're instantly-- now
you're in a lucid dream.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: So give
some of the techniques

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.015 align:middle line:10%
that you would do
during the day,

00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:36.538 align:middle line:10%
for example, once you've
committed to finding out

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:10%
that you're in the dream
state and in the process

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:10%
of lucid dreaming.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the
great techniques--

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:10%
and it's a bit of homework,
but it's not going to eat

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:10%
into your day-- is just a
couple times throughout the day,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:10%
asking yourself, am I dreaming?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:10%
And just saying, am I dreaming?

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:10%
Oh, no, I'm not dreaming because
I'm driving to work right now.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:10%
But saying, am I dreaming?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:10%
And taking a brief moment
to actually think about it.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:10%
Like, wait a second, is there
any weird moments going on?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Is there a pink elephant
walking across the street?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:10%
That might be a sign that
you're either at the circus

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:10%
or that you're dreaming.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:10%
But saying that.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And you can do it
during certain moments,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:10%
like every time you walk
through your front door,

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:10%
ask a question-- am I dreaming?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:10%
Or every time you
get in your car--

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:10%
am I dreaming?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It's starting to
set the pattern of the question

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
so that it can translate
into dream time.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And then all this leads
up to a moment where

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:10%
you're in the dream, and
your body, and your mind that

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:10%
has become accustomed
to asking that question,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:10%
asks the question,
am I dreaming?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.702 align:middle line:10%
And in the dream,
probably at first,

00:18:48.702 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:10%
you'll be like, oh,
no, I'm not dreaming.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And then, wait a second,
I just flew to this party.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm in a dream.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:10%
And then that's the
moment where you've

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.548 align:middle line:10%
switched from not being
lucid to becoming lucid.

00:19:03.548 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
our Regina Meredith

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:90%
talking to a dream expert.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.997 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
what he had to say?

00:19:07.997 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it's
very traditional.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important, he
pointed out several things,

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
one is the notion of across
the day, asking, am I dreaming?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that makes us aware of
the fact that we do dream.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Also, you see that within
Tibetan Buddhism, the Vajrayana

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
practices, the notion
of looking at the world

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
we live in right now as a dream,
that everything is a dream,

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.283 align:middle line:84%
everything is a projection of
our own mind on some level.

00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
mean it's not real.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It just means that our
understanding of it

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.725 align:middle line:90%
comes from within our own mind.

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The other statement
he said about

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
"as you're walking
through doors,"

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:84%
this has to do with what's
known as liminality.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you pass
through a gateway,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
the notion is that you're moving
from one domain to another.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that one of the
practitioners or researchers

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
in a remote viewing
used a method

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
like that to help stimulate
these remote viewing processes.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's why we
often dream in terms

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of, when you think of the
classical symbolism, we

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
talk of the gateway, or
the portal of initiation,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:90%
the doorway.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Knock, and it shall
be open to you.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening there.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So we get to use this physical
world and our experiences in it

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
as a mechanism of triggering
inner experiences.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we're starting
to move into, realistically,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of really esoteric
practices within either Tibetan

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.262 align:middle line:84%
Vajrayana, or Indian Tantra,
or Qabala, or alchemy.

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a
lot of people, Mark,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:90%
who just simply can't sleep.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
They can't sleep.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So they take prescription
pills to sleep.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Does that affect the
dream state at all?

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.272 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Well, it has to.

00:20:42.272 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think so.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
simply because we're

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
complex beings in terms
of our, what we call,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
body, speech, and mind, or
thought, word, and deed.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
That interrelationship
of mind and body,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and the chemistry that unites
the two on different levels,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:90%
is a really subtle one.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And the medication they
take to sleep, what does it

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:90%
do to their dream state?

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.095 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's some
research on that.

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It either enhances
it or dulls it, I would guess.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's got to do
something, one or the other,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:90%
but it can't be the same.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:90%
That's just my guess.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
vitamins and supplements?

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything out there
for the mind and your dreams?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: There is.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:10%
I am not familiar with that,
but I have seen some articles

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:10%
within the last two years
and some books on it that do

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:10%
suggest that certain supplements
will assist in dreaming state.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You see within
traditional herbalism

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's a variety of
herbs that people will often

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:90%
take to enhance dreaming.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that's something that

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.598 align:middle line:84%
should be done very carefully
because you want to make sure

00:21:44.598 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that the herb is, well,
that it's not going to have

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:90%
a negative effect on you.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But people can research
that on their own.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lucid dreaming and
out-of-body experiences.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with an
out-of-body experience,

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you're astrally
traveling throughout.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.703 align:middle line:90%
Are there similarities?

00:22:01.703 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Definitely.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there differences?

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: There
is a difference.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.633 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at traditional
studies, again, whether it's in

00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
"Between the Gates"
and how this relates

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to Western esoteric practices,
or, say, Tibetan Vajrayana,

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
or even the Bon practices,
or even the Taoist practices

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
on dreaming, there is
a clear distinction

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:90%
that lucid dreaming is critical.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It is a critical state in
each of our spiritual paths

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
and unfoldment.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because it is
the foundation that we then

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
use to have controlled
interactions with our own mind

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and then controlled,
what we would

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
call, out-of-body experiences.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These out-of-body
experiences, of course,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I've had one when I was 11.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I've not, Mark, been
able to duplicate it.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank God I can do lucid
dreaming a little better

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
than I can do remote viewing.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, it all has
to do with meditation,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and practice, and
training, doesn't it?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's it.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And look, lucid dreaming
is one of those things.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
to sleep anyhow.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And wake up.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.173 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, I hope,
and wake up, right.

00:23:08.173 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So it really is among
the easiest practices

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.852 align:middle line:84%
to integrate into
your spiritual path.

00:23:14.852 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to fall
asleep, so just take

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
a few minutes, two,
three, four minutes.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not that much.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
dying is like being

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
in a continuous dream?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The research
and the tradition

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:84%
suggests that there is
a strong relationship

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
between the dreaming
and what goes on

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
in the death process, the
things of our own mind

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
unfold and occur before us,
and that we process them

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
to some degree before moving on
to a greater level of clarity,

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:90%
hopefully.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm beginning to think
more and more that if there are

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences, and
if the afterlife exists--

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and I believe it does--

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that it is probably
like a dream.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got that
kind of flow to it.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's a dream
or a lucid dream when you die.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I believe
that it's a lucid dream,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and I say that because you're
aware that the process is

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%
unfolding, we'll assume.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think you
know you're dead when you die?

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: There's
a suggestion when

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:90%
you look at the literature.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.166 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because anything
I say definitively,

00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.416 align:middle line:84%
someone will come back and
say, well, how do you know?

00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:25.999 align:middle line:84%
Have you talked to
anybody who's dead?

00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's debatable.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
There's always a room for
argument or dismissiveness.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But if we just look at the
literature, whether it's

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:84%
traditional literature, or
from the Society for Psychical

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Research in the 120 or
30 years of research

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
they've done on psychic research
and afterlife encounters,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
there is reason to believe that
at some point, whether it's

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
immediately or a few what we
think of as days afterwards,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
people recognize
that they're dead.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:53.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:53.665 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Goldberg,
hypnotherapist,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.273 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to say
about dreams and OBEs.

00:24:59.273 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG: Here's
an example of dreams.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.935 align:middle line:10%
Remember I told you dreams
are out-of-body experiences.

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.978 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Let me give you a
dream example that you've had

00:25:05.978 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and everybody out there
in TV land has had--

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.625 align:middle line:10%
dreams of flying.

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's had
dreams of flying.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh,
everybody's had that.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Sure.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Now there's
a second dream too.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:10%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:10%
Dreams of flying
is when your soul

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:10%
leaves the body
from the Earth plane

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:10%
and goes up into
the astral plane.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In your dream state?

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:10%
Or is it really happening?

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: No, it's
really happening.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: When
you're dreaming,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:10%
your soul is out of the body.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.273 align:middle line:10%
Now you say, what about being
possessed or a psychic attack?

00:25:27.273 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:10%
No, you leave a
clone of yourself,

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:10%
like an alias on a computer, so
your body is always protected.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:10%
Now there's another
dream that people have

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.247 align:middle line:10%
when they feel like they're
falling into an abyss.

00:25:36.247 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:10%
They never splat, but
they feel like they're

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:10%
falling into a deep crevice.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:10%
And you think if
you hit, you die.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Right,
but you don't.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've
always thought that.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
can hear a pin drop.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
You hear this, maybe, like a--

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.293 align:middle line:10%
shh-- whooshing sound, or
like the roar of the sea

00:25:49.293 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:10%
kind of thing, which is
characteristic of the astral

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:10%
plane, but you don't splat.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:10%
That's when your soul is
returning from the astral plane

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth plane.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.295 align:middle line:10%
So those are remnants,
conscious remnants,

00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:10%
of out-of-body experiences.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And sometimes, that's
a jarring effect for us,

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:10%
when you feel that.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:10%
Think of it this way.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.946 align:middle line:10%
When you wake up in the
morning, do you ever

00:26:06.946 --> 00:26:09.363 align:middle line:10%
notice, for a few seconds, you
don't know what time it is?

00:26:09.363 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:10%
Is it 7:00 AM, or is it 7:00 PM?

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.722 align:middle line:10%
What planet am I on?

00:26:12.722 --> 00:26:13.555 align:middle line:10%
You get disoriented.

00:26:13.555 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where am I?

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Just
for a few seconds.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why is
because your astral body

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:10%
has slammed back into
the physical body,

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:10%
and it's very disruptive,
just for a second or two.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the slamming
effect wakes you up.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes,
well, that's true.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.435 align:middle line:10%
Whether you have an
alarm clock or not,

00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:10%
it's your automatic alarm clock.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
your preference,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
would you prefer an out-of-body
experience or a lucid dream?

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Wow,
that's a tough one.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I think I will go with
out-of-body experience.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: I think.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
because at that point,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
not only are we having the same
capacity of the lucid dream,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but also there is
an expanded capacity

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
ability to, we'll

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
say, using the term
loosely, visit other places

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or dimensions that
aren't necessarily

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
always apparent to us in
the lucid dream state.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How in control
are you with a lucid dream?

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Myself?

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: When I have
them, and I have them

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
several times a month,
it's usually very good.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:90%
The control is good.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It's solid.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.423 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm dreaming.

00:27:18.423 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm able to do a few things.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to direct or change
the direction of the dream.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But often, at that
point, when you get used to it,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't do it anymore.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I just let the dream unfold,
knowing that it's a dream.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, I
said a lucid dream

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is coming from another
aspect of my being,

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.650 align:middle line:84%
so the goal is to just
relax, and let it unfold,

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and see what it has.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:90%
What am I teaching myself?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to know.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
We try to manipulate
so much across the day,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe sometimes, it's good to
know I can manipulate this,

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.072 align:middle line:90%
but I don't need to.

00:27:51.072 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So sometimes, you
could be in a lucid dream,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:90%
but not get involved.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.115 align:middle line:90%
You just simply still watch.

00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Of course.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, the best
thing, because I say,

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.808 align:middle line:90%
oh, I know this is a dream--

00:27:59.808 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll step
in when I have to.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And I know
this is important.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
That's often what goes on in
my own mind, quite frankly.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I know this is a dream, and
I know this is important,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:90%
so pay attention.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we even
dream in the first place?

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.405 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Again, I think that
modern scientists have really

00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated quite
well to us that it's

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
a way of just
processing information.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is complex, and we
absorb a tremendous amount

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
of data across the
day, tremendous amount

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of experiences.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And our subconscious is
processing this information out

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
for us, based upon our
notions and value systems.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you said
you'd prefer to do an OBE--

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experience.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that then?

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That is when you have
an experience, and you say, OK,

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
it has the same qualities
as a lucid dream,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's lucidity,
but you're not in some--

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:84%
rarely are you in some
kind of, we'll say,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:90%
fantasy land or a dreamscape.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's reality.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, you're standing
in the room of your bedroom,

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
or you're standing in the
hallway of your house.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The operating room,
if you're having surgery.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Exactly.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Operating.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You know that you are,
in some kind of way,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
no longer in your physical
body, and yet, you

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing either
the physical world,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
or maybe some would say it's
astral reflection, somehow,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but you are experiencing
something that is definitely

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
connected to terra
firma and the reality

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of your day-to-day
awakening life.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And often, it will
involve, maybe, sometimes,

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.615 align:middle line:90%
you are visiting people.

00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We've heard of
these experiences.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.332 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We have
many great saints,

00:29:42.332 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:84%
like Padre Pio,
bilocation, known

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to appear in several
places at the same time.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:84%
We see in the religious
literature, different saints

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:84%
or people appearing to
others, and giving teachings,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.557 align:middle line:90%
and then disappearing.

00:29:53.557 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
had other people,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, say, hey, I
saw you last night here.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.275 align:middle line:90%
You were never there.

00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:00.075 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Either
it's a doppelganger,

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it was your OBE,
and you materialized somehow.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.728 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that's really
a funny part is it may happen,

00:30:08.728 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:90%
and we're not even aware of it.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know that.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Right.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do, but we don't.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because for whatever
reason, they perceive it.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we seem to
communicate with them too.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.633 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.342 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, this
is the part about it.

00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We are so complex, just
in and of ourselves.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
said, "know thyself."

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Over the Temple of
Apollo Delphi in Ancient

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Greece was inscribed the
injunction, "know thyself."

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:84%
We are so complex that there's
stuff going on inside of us

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:84%
right now that we
are not aware of,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and that the more
awareness we bring to it,

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to it,
and relax, the greater

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
fulfillment we have.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, that just
reaches beyond us and touches

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:90%
other people too.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And it can be in very practical
ways, just like you said.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.412 align:middle line:90%
Someone says, George, I saw you.

00:31:02.412 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:90%
You were talking to me.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You were at the ballgame
right next to me.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.647 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah,
right next to me.

00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:90%
You say, no, I wasn't.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I was at home.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:90%
I was passed out on the couch.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a long day at
work, and I'm done.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ability to
perform in an OBE or lucid

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.540 align:middle line:84%
dreaming, is it connected
to the physical body,

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:90%
or is it outside of that?

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's a tough one.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I would say, from
my own experiences,

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and the people I've spoken
to, and what literature

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
exists on it traditionally,
that it is intimately connected

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.380 align:middle line:90%
to what is outside of it.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:84%
That is, the physical body is
relaxed, in most instances,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is completely relaxed,
immobile, asleep,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
or in deep, deep,
deep relaxation,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and the individual's
mind and whatever

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
other energetic
capacities the mind

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
carries with it, whether we talk
about psychic centers and all

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:84%
these things, is now
off doing what it does.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
instances, and there

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
are suggested
techniques that I have

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
seen, in which people
are able to engage

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:84%
in that same
out-of-body experience

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.840 align:middle line:90%
while physically moving.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
That is, they can create
a movement or ritual,

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that then somehow
is perceivable at a distance.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
you prefer the OBE?

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think it's
because, again, it's the greater

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:90%
freedom that it bestows.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Just as a lucid dream
bestows greater freedom on us

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.928 align:middle line:84%
than a day-to-day
dream, in many ways,

00:32:40.928 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
even greater freedom than
day-to-day life, right?

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.512 align:middle line:84%
Because we could do
things in a lucid

00:32:44.512 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
dream that we can't
do in physical life.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:90%
We can grow wings and fly.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:90%
We can swim under the sea.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you want to.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Right.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:90%
If you want to.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Swim under the sea.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Do all sorts of great stuff.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The OOB, or the beginning of
the out-of-body, and then we

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:84%
can even move that into what
we call astral projection.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll say out-of-body really
is connected to experiences

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:84%
in this realm, whereas we
think of astral projection now

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:84%
has to do with more
complex and subtle levels

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of psychic awareness.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
But just like this world,
they're a consensual reality,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I think is the term that's used.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Other entities, other beings,
other consciousness is there.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we would think
of as different heavens,

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
or the Buddha realms,
or Dharma realms.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it
that fascinates you

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:90%
about all of this work?

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Just because
it's part of who we are,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and what is our nature,
who are we as individuals,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and what is the
purpose for our life.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The people who I've met and look
up to across my life-- and I

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:90%
continue to look up to people.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:90%
That hasn't stopped.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I always look to say,
what is this person?

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:90%
What great skill do they have?

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:90%
What have they accomplished?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.310 align:middle line:90%
How can I--

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they accomplish it?

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: How they
accomplished it,

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and that means how
I can too, it's

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
always about
discovering our limits

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:90%
and then overcoming them.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you think
pure greatness has occurred

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
in the dream state--

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where people
have changed their lives

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they've
had to do that way?

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You meet
people again and again.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not always when they're
awake, but often in a dream,

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:90%
there'll be that breakthrough.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.422 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:34:24.422 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
open that business.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.088 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to write that book.

00:34:27.088 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
that invention.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
take on that career.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it came
to me in a dream.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And it
came to me in a dream.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.127 align:middle line:84%
And when we hear
the word "dream,"

00:34:35.127 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
we think of our, what we
call, day-to-day dreams,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:84%
our common dreams, what
Buddhists call karmic dreams,

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:84%
just the stuff jutting
around in our heads.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.139 align:middle line:90%
This isn't like that.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
This is that profound awakening,
like Christian Rosenkreutz who

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
has the angel come to him
and says, hey, come on.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going somewhere.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention here.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
little babies dream?

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Oh, I'm sure they do.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I just wouldn't
know enough to speak

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:90%
about it in any form of manner.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be
a fascinating study.

00:35:01.722 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
you get your answer.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.898 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I guess
you'd have to do

00:35:04.898 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:84%
a lot of neurological
connectivity

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and do scans on them.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One day,
I think science

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.660 align:middle line:84%
will catch up and be able to
put electrodes on your brain.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You go to sleep, and
we'll see your dream

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
as it's a video on a screen.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be amazing?

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That would
be very interesting.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
conceivable, isn't it?

00:35:26.258 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
that's the beauty of it.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we conceive
of, somehow, we've

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:90%
been able to achieve.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And technology, particularly
our understanding

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and the
brain, is advancing

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:90%
more so now than it ever had.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting greater
and greater understanding

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of that mind-body connection,
but also mind-brain connection.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.648 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the body of light?

00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The body of light is
probably the most fascinating

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:90%
thing that we have.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we have that
continuum from meditation

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to dreaming to lucid dreaming,
OOB, astral projection.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The body of light is a actual
vehicle of consciousness

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that you see
recorded and reported

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:84%
in different
esoteric traditions.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So you said how you
have a lucid dream,

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.220 align:middle line:90%
but you don't see yourself.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's an actual
sense of self.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual
vehicle, if you will,

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:84%
or body of energy that
allows you to consciously act

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.395 align:middle line:90%
in these spiritual dimensions.

00:36:22.395 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a Gaia
series, Mark, called,

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.850 align:middle line:84%
"Arcanum," which
investigated the history

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:90%
of the body of light.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE HENRY: Mystics
believe that Adam and Eve were

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.920 align:middle line:10%
originally beings of light.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Rabbinical tradition also

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:10%
says that Adam and Eve were
covered with a cloud of glory,

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:10%
meaning they glowed
rainbow rays.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE HENRY: Adam's
garment is identical

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:10%
to the celestial
robes of the righteous

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.930 align:middle line:10%
in the Jewish and Christian
mystery tradition.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: It is described
as a shining garment or garment

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:10%
of light.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE HENRY: It was of
extraordinary brilliance

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:10%
and splendor, and because of
it, Adam and Eve possessed

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:10%
supernatural qualities.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: This glowing,
rainbow body was taken away

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:10%
from humanity, mystics say,
and our goal is to reclaim it.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE HENRY: In
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.315 align:middle line:10%
the Essenes proclaim
the faithful were

00:37:25.315 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:10%
to receive life everlasting,
and a crown of glory,

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:10%
and a robe of honor
amid light perpetual.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Is
it possible that Adam

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:10%
and Eve's glorious
and glowing garment

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:10%
is the original body of
light within all of us?

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE HENRY: In William's
feature investigation,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.460 align:middle line:10%
we will explore the mystical
teaching that tells us

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:10%
that we are all in the process
of morphing into a higher form.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:10%
In one lifetime,
we can transform

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.560 align:middle line:10%
or morph into what they call
the rainbow body of light.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, do you agree
everyone has a body of light?

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.203 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes,
for the most part.

00:38:08.203 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:84%
There's always subtle
differences in interpretation,

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but that notion that
they've put forth

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:84%
are in accordance
with most traditions.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jesus always
was depicted in pictures

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:10%
of having light around him.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Would he be considered one
of these bodies of light?

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: Yes, because
of the transformation

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:10%
which took place.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And remember, within
Judaism and Christianity,

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
coming from
Babylonian captivity,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
you hear the phrase "thought,
word, and deed," and the idea

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts, our words,
and our actions or our body,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
need to be harmonious
or integrated.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
process mentioned even

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in NLP, [INAUDIBLE]
in terms of congruity.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Within Tibetan
Buddhism, where they

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
talk about the rainbow body,
you have body, speech, and mind.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the same process, the
idea that these aspects of us,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
our energetic aspects,
when harmonized,

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:84%
create an ability to
overcome what we would think

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of as normal
limitations, so that we

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
have the ability, simply
put, mind-body connection.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to start
practicing lucid dreaming.

00:39:18.298 --> 00:39:19.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.465 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's it.

00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Because then there's
greater congruity here,

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:90%
greater harmony taking place.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The mind, we say,
takes on the ability

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
through concentration
and meditation,

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:84%
not only to have the out-of-body
experience, but through it,

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to create, through its
own mental processes,

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
an astral body or form,
which, of course, is light,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not matter
as we think of it.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And hence, that body of light
is what is used in these.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:84%
What they're referring to,
it is a mental construct

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:90%
that each individual creates.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
That needs to be
clearly understood.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And you see within
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:01.250 align:middle line:84%
in the Dzogchen tradition,
the formation of this rainbow

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
body, as they called it,
this transformational process

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.990 align:middle line:90%
is a large part of it.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But it also can
happen spontaneously

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
there, or naturally, I
should say, naturally there,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
through decades and
decades of practice.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, what is
your website, for folks

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:90%
who want to track you?

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: It is
hermeticinstitute.org.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.520 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: That's it.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Thank you very
much for having me here.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.373 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lucid
dreaming-- I can't wait

00:40:24.373 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:90%
to continue to practice it.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what will happen?

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."
