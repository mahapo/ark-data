We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Aaron Abke, founder
of 4D University,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:10%
teaching the Law of One,
Christ consciousness,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual intelligence.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Aaron intends to help humanity
ascend to the fourth density

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
His mission is to awaken
our collective destiny

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:90%
as an enlightened civilization.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:10%

Aaron, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AARON ABKE: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.032 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an amazing
repertoire you have.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.608 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I like to dabble in a
lot of subjects, you might say.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
all happen for you?

00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, I
was born and raised

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:84%
as a third generation
pastor's kid.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So being brought up in
a very spiritual family

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:90%
was kind of my origin.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And ended up leaving
Christianity at around 23

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of pursued Eastern
teachings and enlightenment

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And eventually came back
full circle to Christ again,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
but through the Christ
consciousness lens.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a very
beautiful journey for sure.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were a pastor
at the age of 22 years old?

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I was,
yeah, for one year.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that like?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: I really enjoyed it.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed being a pastor.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a worship leader.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I was the worship
pastor of the church.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to work my way--

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
my career plan was to follow
in my dad and grandfather's

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
footsteps and be a
senior pastor one day.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But you got to start somewhere
like in every industry.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So I started as a worship
pastor, and that was my passion.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
the church I worked

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
at that forced me to start
reconciling with some

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of the dogmatic beliefs of
Christian fundamentalism

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
that I had the luxury of not
having to confront growing up

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
because my dad never preached
on hellfire, damnation type

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:90%
sermons.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He's very much emphasized
the love of God,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:90%
the goodness of God.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had to confront
those beliefs of like,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
do I believe in this
version of God or not?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was a clear no
for me at that age.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when I decided
to blow my life up and start

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:90%
everything over again.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your dad
sounded very upbeat.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: He is.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I would
be able to say this

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
at this point in my life.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But when I came out
of Christianity at 23,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
as you can imagine, it was
pretty tough for my dad,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
thinking his son
has become a heretic

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and is going wayward and stuff.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Going the
wrong direction.

00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:50.706 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Right.

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But over the years watching
my content on YouTube,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I have never tried to
force a conversation

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with my dad about
any of this stuff

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
because I knew it would
probably be contentious.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I just let him kind of
approach it on his own speed.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, he
started listening to my videos

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
on Jesus and Christ
consciousness.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
He's had his own kind
of disillusionment

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:90%
from the church as well.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But I can say today
that my dad is

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
fully on board with everything
I teach and talk about,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in almost perfect
alignment with it, which

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is a huge blessing for me
because I kind of always thought

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
my dad and I would have
parted ways on these issues.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aaron, how did
you make this transition

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
from being a pastor to a
personal trainer and a fitness

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:90%
model?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, when
I left Christianity,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of my
whole identity.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't even know who I was.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, who is Aaron Abke
without being a Christian?

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%
That's my whole identity.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So I needed an outlet to have
my identity fixated upon.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And fitness was always kind of
another passion of mine growing

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
up secondary to my faith.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So I dove headlong into
full time bodybuilding,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
professional fitness modeling,
CrossFit competition.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was a full time trainer
at Google for four years

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and eight years in total.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
working at Google

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
as a personal trainer where
my sort of spiritual awakening

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were employed by
Google as a personal trainer

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:90%
for their staff?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
I was a contractor so I didn't
work directly for Google,

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
but they do a lot
of contract work.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And I would work in--

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
there's about, I think, six gyms
on campus at the Googleplex.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So I worked at the main
gym, on the main campus.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.023 align:middle line:84%
And I would train their software
engineers and stuff like that.

00:04:35.023 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere
along the line,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
you had a spiritual awakening.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
What was that catalyst for you?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, the
catalyst was really

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
just sort of going through
the dark night of the soul.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Divorced at 26, left my
religion and faith at 23.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Every single friend, every
single family member I had

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:90%
was a hardcore Christian.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
So I had no friends.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of my family had sort of
ostracized me as a heretic.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd moved back home in with
my parents after my divorce.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I had no friends.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm living alone
in the Bay Area.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
depressing time for me.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was really seeking
what do I believe

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
about God and the divine.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when I was diving
into Eckhart Tolle, Alan Watts,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
and teachers like that.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it was during my
lunch breaks at Google,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I would go up to this
balcony above my gym

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and listen to Eckhart
Tolle for an hour

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
while I ate and just
watch the clouds.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the only time
of my day I could relax and be

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
at peace listening to Eckhart.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Most of the day,
my mind was just

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.485 align:middle line:84%
going with all the
stories and stuff.

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doo doo
doo doo doo doo.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And just one particular day,
maybe two or three months

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
into doing this habit, I
was listening to a lecture

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
where Eckhart was mocking
things that our ego says to us.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, if only people could
recognize how important I am,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
then I would truly be happy.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And he would laugh and
the audience would laugh.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was laughing
with him each time he

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:90%
said one of these statements.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed myself into
a kind of samadhi state

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
where I realized what he's
saying is absolutely true.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like a tape
recorder in my brain.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like we all have this
same voice of the ego.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's not really who I am.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that realization
that I laughed myself

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
into having put me
in this Buddha state

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
for two weeks where
I got to enjoy

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a sort of free sample
of enlightenment

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and spent two weeks in the
most blissful, serene state

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it was two
weeks to the day

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that I woke up in the morning
and noticed on my alarm

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that it was two weeks since
this experience had happened.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was when the first
ego thought came back online.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And my ego basically
said, wow, it's

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
been two full weeks I've been
in this state of perfect bliss

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I might
be enlightened.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first thought I didn't

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.642 align:middle line:84%
catch from the ego trying to
claim enlightenment for itself.

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And from there, my ego came
back online very quickly.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And all my old
stories came back in.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.765 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel myself kind
of being cast from heaven,

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:11.565 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And I didn't
want to be, but I didn't

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:90%
have a choice in the matter.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the big
catalyst that really brought me

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to where I am today.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say the ego,
what does that mean to you?

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: It means something
very different to me

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
now than it would have 10
years ago when it happened.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The way that I
teach ego today is

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that we often hear this
phrase, the ego doesn't exist.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And it almost feels like a kind
of gaslighting because what do

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:90%
you mean the ego doesn't exist?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I hear it talking to me all day.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I suffer from it.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
How can it not exist?

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought about
that question a lot.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to say
the ego doesn't exist

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and yet it torments me?

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it means is that
the ego is not an isolated

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
entity of any kind, but it's
actually a mental activity

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:90%
that we mistake for an entity.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So the definition that I
give in many of my courses

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
is the ego is the mental
activity of identifying

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
or claiming I am
this, I am that.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is
always doing this

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.262 align:middle line:84%
because it's been programmed
through evolution to do this.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And we just take it
for granted that it's

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:90%
me thinking all these thoughts.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually start
to become aware of the voice

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.887 align:middle line:84%
in the head that
says, I'm this person.

00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:90%
This happened to me.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.553 align:middle line:90%
That happened to me.

00:08:27.553 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Story, story,
claiming everything.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to
detach from it a bit

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
and observe it as a
neutral participant.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that
when you do that,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that voice starts to
quiet pretty quickly.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a real entity that's
talking to you in your mind.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
reflexive mechanism

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that it will claim anything
that's put in front of it--

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
a name, a person, a story,
an identity, a role.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the job that
nature has given to ego.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not an
alter ego within you?

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: You could
definitely call it that.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it will become
that if you let it.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The title of your
book, Three Beliefs of Ego,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.252 align:middle line:90%
tell me about that title.

00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So the
three beliefs of ego

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest
blessing that came out

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
of that whole experience
I just explained

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of having that two-week
Satori experience

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and then being thrown out
of it and thrown right

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
back into my depressive state.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And really, it was much worse
after having tasted heaven

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:90%
to be thrown back into hell.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.443 align:middle line:90%
Hell is bad enough by itself.

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think so?

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you've tasted heaven
and then go back to hell,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
it's much worse because now
you know what's available

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and what's the alternative.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
happened to me was

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
once I had tasted that
that state of consciousness

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely real and
available, nothing in the world

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:90%
could satisfy me anymore.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of my
personal training

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
life or my bodybuilding career,
my fitness modeling career.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
None of it meant
anything anymore.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And all I wanted to do was to
figure out how do I get back

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:90%
to that state of consciousness.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And in that inquiry, I guess
you could just say the universe,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
divine intelligence
kind of led me

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
through this process
of understanding

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
because my main question
was, why do I suffer?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
What is my-- at the core, what
is my suffering based upon?

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
noticing that really it's

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:84%
just three emotions
that I ever suffer from

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
or that any human being
suffers from which you could

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:90%
call sadness, anger, and fear.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's many flavors
of those emotions--

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
happiness in there?

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.955 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Well, negative emotions.

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.883 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: There's only
three negative emotions

00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that we suffer from or
that we call suffering.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Different forms of
sadness or anger or fear.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that became very
clear to me that yeah,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:84%
these are the only
three negative emotions

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:90%
human beings really suffer from.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
true, they must all

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
appear for a specific
reason, because why do you

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
feel sad rather than
angry or vice versa.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain reason why
you respond with that emotion.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to figure
out what is that reason.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was the inquiry that
led to this understanding

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.755 align:middle line:84%
that each emotion is actually
signaling a different belief

00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:90%
in the ego mind.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And your emotions are
actually your guidance system,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
your negative
emotions, especially,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to clue
you in on what belief

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
is operating in your mind right
now that's causing this emotion.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And so just to simplify
it really quickly,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
sadness, the emotion of
sadness is the signal

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:90%
for the belief in lack.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I am lacking.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Something is not
here that I need.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something is missing.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Something is missing.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
You only feel sadness--

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
anyone listening can
investigate this.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
You only feel sad
because you believe

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't have something
you need or want,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:84%
or that you lost something
you need or want.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's very clear.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
The next emotion is anger.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And these three beliefs
all connect to each other,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So once I believe I'm
lacking, that kind of

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
implies the second
belief, which is maybe

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I can fulfill my lack
out in the world.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the second belief
of ego, which is attachment.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so attachment is
what causes anger,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
because anytime your
attachments get blocked,

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
what's the response?

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Anger, upset, right?

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So anger is the
emotion that says,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're attached
to something here

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
that you need to look at.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then if I'm lacking and
the world can fulfill me,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and I've got to go get my
happiness out in the world--

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
sex, drugs, rock and
roll, whatever it is--

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:84%
then that implies
the third belief,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
which is more subtle
than the first two,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:90%
but the most pervasive.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's the belief that
I'm the doer of actions

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:90%
or I'm in control of life.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one, not the universe,
not God, no higher power.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: The separate self.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Me, the ego.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I go out and get what I want.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I control life.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
I bend life to my will.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I make things happen.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the third belief.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
belief that produces

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:90%
fear, the third emotion.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
anytime you feel

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
like you don't have
control over something?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Stress, anxiety, panic,
worry, fear will set in.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's the three beliefs.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Law of One?

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, the Law of One
separating it from the text,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
the Law of One, what is
the actual Law of One to me

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is the awareness that there's
only one being in the universe.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of One to me really
spells out what causes karma,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
because negative
karma has to then

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
be any infringement
against the Law of One.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if the Law
of One says there's

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:90%
only one being in the universe.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You are that being,
I am that being,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and everything in
creation is it.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Then if I do harm to
anyone, like willful harm,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
then I'm definitely in
violation of that Law of One.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if I violate the
Law of One by doing harm,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I create negative karma that
cycles back around to me.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.212 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it bites you.

00:14:04.212 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: It bites you
because the universe

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
is built on perfect balance.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything exists
in perfect balance.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So if I try to unbalance the
universe by judging, hating,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
attacking, causing
harm to it in any way,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the law must violate
me in equal measure,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
must balance me in equal
measure because you can't

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:90%
make the universe unbalanced.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And we call that karma
in the Hindu tradition.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's
just the Law of One.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
There's only one real
law in the universe.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus said this too, right?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Lord, what is the greatest
commandment of all?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Love God with all your heart and
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the summary
of the Law of One.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Your pastor is
coming out of you.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: It happens.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Law of One
you turned into something

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So I found the text
shortly after that

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:90%
experience I described.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was just blown away by
this remarkable text and all

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:90%
the teachings it has to offer.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd never come across
material like this.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was really surprised
that there was almost nothing

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:90%
about it online, on YouTube.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
research more of it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
There was almost no
videos that I could find.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had just started
my YouTube channel

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:90%
six months before that.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, well, why not me?

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll make some videos.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that it would be
stuff that was way too out there

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:90%
for most people.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
But boy, was I wrong.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Because my first video on the
seven densities of consciousness

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.922 align:middle line:90%
went like mega viral.

00:15:32.922 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And people were like,
this is incredible.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Give us more.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up doing a
whole series over the next--

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got like 26
million views or something

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I think 26 episodes too in the
Law of One series, something

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a long
running series.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's just so much to
unpack with the Law of One.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kundalini
comes up a lot.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Well, so kundalini--

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
the Law of One has really
helped me to understand

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:90%
what kundalini is.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because about two
years, three years

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
after that initial
awakening, I started

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
going through classic
kundalini awakening symptoms.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
anything really

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:90%
about kundalini at that time.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it's a phenomenon
that people experience,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know what
was happening in my body.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.083 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe this is
like kundalini symptoms.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about that.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Let me research that.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reading the
sutras and yogic texts.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And they're helping
me understand it a bit.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But really, it was
the Law of One.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And understanding those
really the chakras,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
the energy centers,
and the seven

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
densities that really
helped it click

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:84%
for me, which is that
every human being is born

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
with the first three
chakras in activation--

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:90%
the red, orange, and yellow ray.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But human beings have
to earn the green ray.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
This is our evolutionary
leap in this lifetime

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is to try to go from solar
plexus to heart chakra

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
or from third to fourth
density consciousness.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's not easy.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: It's not.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not as easy
as you would think.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Really because it
requires you to balance

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
your ego, which is not easy.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
But when you are on a spiritual
path, especially when you

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
have a passionate, devotional
relationship to the divine,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
when you love God as Jesus
said with all your heart,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that is really the catalyst that
sparks kundalini to turn on,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
because kundalini is our
green ray energy turning on

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people know that, Aaron?

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Not many.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They will after
watching you on this show.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Maybe.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a course where
I teach this as well.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
It connected the dots
for me because the Hindus

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
have taught for a long
time that kundalini

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is the divine feminine
energy, the energy of love.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And that love is what
awakens kundalini.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're bang on.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But the Law of One shows
that the fourth chakra

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:90%
is the heart chakra.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It represents love and
oneness with all things.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to integrate
oneness into your awareness,

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that's what will really turn
on kundalini because you're

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
basically sending a
signal to your body,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to your nervous system.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I need to upgrade my nervous
system to the next frequency

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
level, which is the
fourth density level,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
so this purging
has to take place.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why classically,
in kundalini awakenings,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
any kundalini guru
will warn you about,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
hey, don't go into
this thing recklessly.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
turn kundalini on,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
she comes with that fire to
purify your whole nervous,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:90%
your mind, everything.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's ready.

00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
You had a vision with kundalini.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So this was
in 2020, I believe.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd been having this--

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
the most notable
phenomenon for me,

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's different
for everybody,

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:84%
was I call them volcano
veins because I didn't

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
know how else to describe it.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's the meridians.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It was especially down
my forearms and shins,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
but also up my back
a bit and neck,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:84%
where I would feel this
tremendously hot, almost

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:90%
like electrical sensation.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tingly?

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Not tingly but hot.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Burning hot but not painful.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:90%
And it would get so intense.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
If I would sit down like this
for a certain period of time,

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
it would start to build up.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would have to get up
and walk around my house

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.093 align:middle line:90%
to get the energy to calm down.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think
something was wrong with you?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: No.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.772 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think something
was wrong with me.

00:19:25.772 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was some kind
of spiritual phenomenon.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I could sort of sense
that I hadn't connected

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:90%
it to kundalini just yet.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But this is what sparked me to
start researching kundalini.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point
where every single night

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
when I would lay down to sleep,
I would wake up about an hour

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
into my sleep with my arms just
scorching hot with these volcano

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:90%
veins down my fingers and hands.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have to get up
and walk through my house

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:90%
to calm the energy down.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it was probably like
six months of that until the--

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I call it an inner conjunction.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's the classic kundalini
activation everybody knows of.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And really, everybody thinks
of kundalini awakening, when

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
you hear that term,
people think it's

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the event that happens where
the lightning bolt shoots up

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
your spine out of
your crown, right?

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're kind of like in
this electrocuted state of God

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:90%
consciousness,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not it, is it?

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: But that's not
what it actually is.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a symptom of it.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But by the time that inner
conjunction event happens

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to somebody, they've
already been in the process

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.167 align:middle line:84%
They maybe didn't know
it, but you don't just

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
have that happen out of nowhere.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a buildup of energy.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So that happened to
me one night where I

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:90%
was-- we had just eaten dinner.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I was watching
Gaia with my wife.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting restless
leg syndrome really, really bad.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you had restless
leg syndrome?

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: OK.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.955 align:middle line:84%
Anybody watching
who's had it knows.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:90%
You're squirming.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You're flexing your legs.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like this energy you
can't get out of your legs.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And my wife's like,
what's going on?

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you, like, spastic?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Almost.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:90%
You're flexing.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You're stretching.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.547 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to get the
sensation to go away,

00:21:00.547 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and it won't go away.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But I've only had this
one other time in my life,

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is way worse than
the last time I had it.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
So I went to bed.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm laying there writhing
in bed with this restless legs

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
syndrome and not having
a clue what's going on.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was about an hour
of writhing like that I

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
finally, kind of from
exhaustion, fell asleep.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I fell
asleep, I describe it

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
as if you attached a fire hose
to the bottom of my spine.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
This incredible sensation
of energy just kind of--

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bursting.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: --burst up my spine
out off the top of my head.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was all of a sudden in
this kind of energy portal.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd only seen the goddess
Shakti like a picture of her,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
like the Hindu traditional
paintings of her maybe

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:90%
once or twice.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.527 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have told you
exactly what she looks like.

00:21:50.527 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
able to say, I think

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
she's got four arms or six
arms, jewelry, fiery eyes,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
that kind of basic thing.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But I saw the goddess
in this energy portal.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredibly
vivid and real.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was really amazed when I
saw it because I'm like, wow,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
the Hindus got her right.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
how she looks, six

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:84%
arms, bright kind of indigo
blue color, piercing eyes.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six arms?

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Six arms.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many legs?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Two from
what I can tell.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Normal human.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Normal human but
with some extra arms.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And she just kind of proceeded
to have this conversation

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
with me where she told
me things about myself

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and what I was processing
through, what she

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
was working through with me.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an incredibly
beautiful experience.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And then after-- it was
probably like five minutes

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.490 align:middle line:90%
that it calmed down.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of laid there
the rest of the night in shock.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So that was my experience
of the inner conjunction.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
The kundalini awakening
did not end there.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The purification
process definitely

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:90%
continued on for quite a while.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aaron, tell me about
the fourth density ascension

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:90%
protocol?

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So that is the protocol
that I put myself through

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to navigate through this
kundalini awakening process.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand that
a kundalini awakening is

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
the ascension of your
own consciousness

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to the fourth density level
of the heart, then we realize,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going through a fourth
density ascension process.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:90%
The four DAP I call it.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The protocol is it's a
three-month program in 4D

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But I basically take people
through a 12-week course where

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.075 align:middle line:84%
each week they have--
its three lessons a week.

00:23:35.075 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
created this course.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Mhm.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And one or two of the three
is a certain yoga practice,

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that classic kundalini
yoga, kriya yoga type stuff,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:90%
or Hatha yoga.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
These are ancient technologies
that the Indians and Tibetans

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
figured out to help
facilitate this energy to move

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:90%
through your nervous system.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole practice
technique of breathwork, asanas,

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
bandhas, and different things
that move kundalini energy

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a couple of
non-sitting practices as well

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:90%
that help facilitate it.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the
resource I wanted

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
to make to help other people who
were going through this process

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
like I was to have a safe
way to self-navigate it.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Because people will
go to, for example,

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
a kundalini awakening retreat
and they'll get shaktipat.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes through
intense breathwork

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll have an inner
conjunction happen.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
These are like big fun
retreats for people to go to

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's kundalinis
are popping and it's exciting.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Very few of these retreats
from what I've found actually

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
kind of equip people with
the knowledge of hey,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
here's what's actually
happening to you

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:90%
and why this event took place.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And here's what you can expect
to happen going forward.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
That information is much harder
to come by than just the novelty

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:90%
of the event itself.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So I wanted to help
people learn what is kundalini.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Why does this happen?

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:90%
How do we help it happen?

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:84%
How do we calm it down
if it's too intense?

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
How do we ramp it up if
we want to ramp it up?

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just a
resource for humanity,

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
for people going through
kundalini awakenings

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to help them self-navigate
through the process.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You help them through
what you call the 4D University?

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you created
along with your wife, Selena.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
her involvement.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So she was
working for Snapchat

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:90%
as a marketing consultant.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd had some other
programs for a while,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
but I'd had this big vision for
years to start 4D University

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and put all these things
we're describing into programs

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So I said, I'm
just going to do it.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's just start somewhere.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Created it.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, hey, if you help
me launch this and if we get--

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we figured
out the numbers

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
with our budget and
our living expenses.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
If we get 200 members, you can
quit your job and work with me

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:90%
full time in 4D U.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So she put together this
incredible marketing email

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
campaign to help get
it out to my audience.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:90%
We had a very successful launch.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:90%
We had like 210 signups.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So we were like, wow, you get to
quit your job and work with me.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And so she kind of
became the COO of 4D U.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
She just has a remarkable gift
for operations, team management,

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:90%
directing tasks and stuff.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff I'm not good
at, she's very good at.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So we're--

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mutual partners
in more ways than one.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We're very yin and
yang in that way.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've left
us some testimonials

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have on video, and
they're absolutely astounding.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER 1: His messages are
precise and clear for whatever

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:90%
you're looking for.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:84%
He shares all these examples
that we all go through,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:84%
all the struggles of
life that we go through.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER 2: He
holistically makes

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:84%
all of this material
so digestible

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and accessible to anyone.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've never heard
someone articulate

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
all of these complex
abstract topics

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
about living life
to your fullest,

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
living through your heart,
being who you truly are.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Aaron exceeded all expectations.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Like speaking with
him, seeing him

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
teach, seeing how true
to the material he is,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and how he's able to connect
with all of the audience.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER 3: He truly
is what he preaches.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:90%
He preaches love.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I feel his love.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:90%
I feel his presence.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
He pay attention when
I was asking questions,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.618 align:middle line:84%
I told him about this pain
that I had on my shoulder.

00:27:35.618 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, are you
ready to release it?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And he prayed for me.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So he's like-- my favorite part
is meeting the beautiful soul

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that he is, that he
preaches what he says.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started with
more than 200 attendees.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:90%
What are you at now?

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I think we're
about 15,000 free members

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 15,000?

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And about 800
actual paying students

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that are taking the
curriculum and whatnot.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
is the curriculum?

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: So it's evergreen.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So whenever people join,
they can start that day,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's dripped out over
a seven-month period.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:84%
There's three programs
that they go through.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of like a
take it at your own pace style.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the SQ test?

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So this
is the project I'm

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
really excited about
that I've been working on

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:90%
for at least three years.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been interested
in this topic of SQ

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual intelligence.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Really, it actually
began, George, at Google,

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
working with the software
engineers as a personal trainer.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I got to see the dichotomy of
different types of intelligence

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
because I'm working with
these software engineers who

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.295 align:middle line:84%
are brilliant, almost
genius level IQ.

00:28:48.295 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: But they have
almost no social skills.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They can barely
maintain eye contact.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not very
emotionally aware.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No relationships.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And so I spent a
lot of my training sessions

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.205 align:middle line:84%
really trying to help bring
my clients out of their shell

00:29:03.205 --> 00:29:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and feel comfortable in
their skin and stuff.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me that there's
different types of intelligence.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, being spiritually
intelligent is a thing.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:90%
But how do we quantify it?

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:90%
How do we define it?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I've attempted to do
that for the last three years.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've slowly been
working towards a model

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that I feel is not the most
accurate possible model, not

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
the best model that
will ever be made.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure other people will make
better models in the future.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to
start somewhere.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's through quantifying the
map of spiritual intelligence

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that exists in you and I, which
is our seven energy centers,

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I sort of began to realize
spiritual intelligence is

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:90%
our own seven energy centers.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Because the way I define it--

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of
definitions for it.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But the simplest one is that
spiritual intelligence is

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:90%
your comprehension of reality.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And so every energy center
represents a different locus

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of comprehension, meaning as
we rise our energy to higher

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and higher centers, it's
almost like a filter that

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.790 align:middle line:90%
opens more and more to reality.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to take in more
of reality, such as moving

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:90%
from ego to heart.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you learn
this by trial and error?

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.015 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh yes.

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think so.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.698 align:middle line:84%
You learn the most through your
own journey and experience,

00:30:20.698 --> 00:30:21.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge can only
take you so far.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is very good.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We need pointers for sure.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
live this stuff out

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to really learn about it.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I learned through
my own journey of SQ

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that there's elements of
reality that I know about but I

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:90%
can't comprehend them.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is SQ stand for?

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So spiritual
quotient similar to IQ.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: But I just call
it spiritual intelligence.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You coined that?

00:30:46.768 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I don't
think I've coined it.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some other
people use the term SQ.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the Gene Keys
uses the term SQ.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's not a very
highly used term, I don't think.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an
accelerator program.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So the program I'm working
on is to teach people

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.430 align:middle line:84%
the seven levels of SQ and
what they represent, and then

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:84%
how we're blocked at
each level and how

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:90%
we progress at each level.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what I've done is
I've boiled down every chakra

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:90%
to its five main qualities.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the lower three
chakras, and this

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is kind of Law of One stuff,
but the lower three chakras

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
according to the Law of One--

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's related
to the Law of One.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh yes.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I've weaved-- the Law of One
has just infiltrated everything

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I think about and
teach, for sure.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But I've used a lot of what
I've learned from the Law of One

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to come up with this model.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And what the Law of One says,
and this is really interesting,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
is that blockages actually only
occur in the lower three energy

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of a misnomer
that some people will say things

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.420 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, my third
eye is blocked

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
or my heart chakra is blocked.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of true, but
it's not the full truth.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The full truth is that all
blockages take place in those

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
lower three energy centers, the
primal rays, as we call them.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And if those
centers are blocked,

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
they don't allow
certain energies

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:90%
to get up to the higher chakras.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So because the energy
of love isn't making it

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.830 align:middle line:84%
past the lower three, you
think your heart is blocked.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
unblock these lower three,

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
your heart is going to shine
with that green ray energy.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:90%
The heart can't be blocked.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
The heart just closes
off to whatever's

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
not love because that's the
frequency of the heart is love.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
come across this?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Through the Law of
One, through just contemplation

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and meditation in
my own practice.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.883 align:middle line:90%
Life reveals things to you.

00:32:36.883 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
When you're interested in them
and when you have a passion

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to know, the universe
definitely wants

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:90%
to unveil its secrets to us.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point
did you realize, Aaron,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I have created something
here and it's working?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: That's a good question.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I really don't have the feeling
that I've created anything,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.940 align:middle line:90%
as weird as that may sound.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look at
what you've done.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.597 align:middle line:90%
On a relative level, for sure.

00:33:02.597 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take a bow.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But when you're just
so cognizant that it's

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:84%
all God bringing
revelation through,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
bringing information through,
I'm just a recipient of it.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, I couldn't have
done this with my own ego.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It's really a gift
that I've been given,

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and so I'm just grateful for it.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I've seen through my
courses and students

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that this understanding of
sort of the map of progressing

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.640 align:middle line:84%
through the chakras is one of
the most helpful frameworks

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:84%
for anybody interested
in spiritual development.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.358 align:middle line:84%
Because when you know
the map of the territory

00:33:39.358 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying
to travel through,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot easier
not to get lost.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But most people are
in the predicament--

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.730 align:middle line:84%
most spiritual seekers are
kind of in this predicament

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:84%
where they don't
really understand

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:84%
exactly the progression of
spirituality and how it unfolds.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they're just kind of left
shooting in the dark for what

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:90%
practice should I do?

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
What should I focus on?

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
wanted to solve,

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
George, is how do I help
someone understand here's

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:90%
where you're at.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Literally, this is
the energy center

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness
is located in right now.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Once I know that, I
know where I'm blocked

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and what I need to do
to balance my blockages

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and rise to the
next energy center.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the universe has
given us this map of SQ

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:84%
in a very clear way
in our own bodies.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Like you are that
map, but you've

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:84%
got to explore yourself
a bit to learn the map.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you apply
these four densities

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:90%
to your teachings?

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So the four densities,
there are seven in total,

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:90%
seven chakras, seven densities.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I really teach mostly one
through three because--

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
or sorry, one through four
because what the Law of One

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.560 align:middle line:84%
lays out very clearly is that
planet Earth is a third density

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is a third
density race of beings

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
attempting to move to the
fourth density right now.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, as of
2012, Earth technically

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
shifted or was magnetized to the
next density of consciousness.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did that?

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Just the
precession of the equinox.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.983 align:middle line:84%
Law of One describes
that the universe works

00:35:14.983 --> 00:35:16.150 align:middle line:90%
like the ticking of a clock.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
The planets rotate and
it's all timed out.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So for the third
density, in specific,

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
they say that there's three
cycles of 25-ish thousand years,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:84%
which we know as the
precession of the equinox.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And every precession that comes
around after that 25,000-year

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:84%
cycle, the Earth becomes
eligible to upgrade its

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
frequency, but only if
the planetary vibration,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that is the people
living on the planet,

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
have raised their consciousness
to that level to a sufficient

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:90%
degree.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the degree they
name is actually

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.080 align:middle line:90%
51% or greater love oriented.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So can you live from your
heart at least 51% of the time?

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the threshold
for entering fourth density.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So humanity has gone through--

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Earth has gone through
three whole cycles of this.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So 75,000 years we've
been in third density.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And as of 2012, the
third cycle has ended

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and the clock has moved
to the fourth density now.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the planet
is taking humanity

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
through an involuntary shadow
work at this point saying,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm going to
the fourth density.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm only going to allow
the human beings on my planet

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:90%
who are going there with me.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
an unevolved soul,

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
really hard time here

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
because the third density
karma and shadows are coming up

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get
probably get lost in those.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And the key is, according to
the Law of One, if you don't

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:84%
graduate to fourth
density in this lifetime,

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:84%
your soul will have to choose
a different third density

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
planet in your next lifetime to
finish out your third density

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.140 align:middle line:90%
learning.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
do, you can come back

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth density Earth.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But the soul has to
go to a planet that

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.555 align:middle line:84%
matches its density
level, which makes

00:36:59.555 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:90%
all the sense in the world.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to
start all over again?

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: No, you
don't start all over.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You pick up where you left off.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But Earth has
graduated apparently

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth density.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
reincarnate onto this planet

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.540 align:middle line:84%
again as a fourth
density being, you've

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:84%
got to get to that 51%
or greater heart chakra

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
activation in this
lifetime or you won't be

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.820 align:middle line:90%
eligible in the next lifetime.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aaron, you give
off a lot of energy.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
emanating from you.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Do people say that to you?

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Every so often,
but not very commonly.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:90%
What is Christ consciousness?

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Christ consciousness is
fourth density consciousness.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the consciousness--

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
one and the same?

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: To me, yes.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.920 align:middle line:90%
They are one and the same.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.556 align:middle line:84%
It's the awareness of oneness as
a course in miracles would say.

00:37:53.556 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
To me, I think we see
the best reflection

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of Christ's consciousness in the
mouth of Jesus in the Gospels.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
When over and over
again, when Jesus

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:84%
was asked, how do I
enter eternal life or how

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:90%
can I be saved?

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This may shock people,
but Jesus never

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:84%
once ever uttered
the words confess me

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.153 align:middle line:84%
as your Lord and Savior or
believe I was resurrected

00:38:18.153 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
or any of the stuff
you're going to hear

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.800 align:middle line:90%
in church of how you get saved.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Every single time,
without one exception,

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was asked,
how do I get saved?

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, love God
with all your heart

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.573 align:middle line:84%
And he went beyond
that many, many times.

00:38:33.573 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And said, and furthermore, if
you don't love your neighbor

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.250 align:middle line:84%
as yourself, you
cannot be saved.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, if you don't forgive
your brother his trespasses,

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
your father cannot forgive
you your trespasses.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how much
you confess me as Lord.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.925 align:middle line:84%
Only the one who does
the will of my Father

00:38:49.925 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:84%
will enter the
kingdom of heaven.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Basically,
the Ten Commandments.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.303 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: He would say,
follow the Ten Commandments,

00:38:55.303 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the first of which is love God,
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said, if
you do this one thing,

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:84%
if you follow this one law, you
have fulfilled the entire law.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
it's the Law of One.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is God in disguise.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So love everyone
as if they're God

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.557 align:middle line:84%
and you've fulfilled
the entire law.

00:39:15.557 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's
Christ Consciousness.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
to a non-believer?

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, if we want to
use that term, a non-believer--

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A skeptic.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes through the
same progression of their soul.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
keep reincarnating

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
in the same realm, whatever
realm that is, until you learn

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:90%
the lessons of that realm.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The universe, I like to say, is
a university for consciousness.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And your own life is the
teacher or your higher self

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is your teacher delivering you
the lessons you need of hey,

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you can be a little
more patient.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
You could be a little more kind.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You could be a little
more forgiving.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Your life is always
delivering you those lessons.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But if the soul doesn't have
enough SQ yet to comprehend,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.300 align:middle line:84%
as we've said, the lessons
that life is serving them,

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
then they miss the
lessons and they

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:84%
keep making the same mistakes
and beating their head

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:90%
against the same walls.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to
keep reincarnating

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.450 align:middle line:90%
until they learn those lessons.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of One says every
human being in third density

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
is here to learn
the lessons of love.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Love is the only salvation
from third density.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And so Jesus, I
think, summarized it

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
very well when he said,
all you've got to do

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:90%
is love God with all your heart.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And the way that you
actually show that you

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:90%
love God with all your heart--

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
because let's be honest,
anybody can say they love God.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And most people say that.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And just spout it off.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just lip service.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But they don't actually love
their neighbor as themselves.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They're judgmental,
hypocritical.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can actually
prove in reality itself, which

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
is all that matters, that you
do love God with all your heart,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
is that you love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
spiritual balancing?

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Spiritual
balancing is a concept

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.175 align:middle line:90%
taught in the Law of One.

00:41:05.175 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the main staple
teachings in 4D University,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:13.020 align:middle line:84%
in our curriculum, that
describes how we unblock those

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
lower three energy centers.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.258 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:41:16.258 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll
like this, George,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.333 align:middle line:84%
because you've studied
a course in miracles,

00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:21.250 align:middle line:90%
at least a little bit.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: OK.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So spiritual balancing
is forgiveness

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:90%
from a course in miracles.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Same exact thing.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But the Law of One
teaches forgiveness

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.480 align:middle line:84%
in a very unique way,
which is that all of us

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:84%
are carrying imbalanced
perspectives.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We see this right
now in our world

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in a big way with the
political divide, right?

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is so triggered
about the other side

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:90%
of the political aisle.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And angry.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Angry,
hostile, all of it.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they're
very, very imbalanced

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:90%
in a certain perspective.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So the Law of One
says, if you want

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to unblock these imbalances
to open the flow of energy

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to rise higher and make
its way in the heart,

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.963 align:middle line:84%
you've got to
spiritually balance them.

00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they
teach that is they

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:84%
say you actually
have to mentally go

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:84%
into the perspective you
hate and despise and consider

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.740 align:middle line:84%
it and contemplate it until you
lose the ability to be triggered

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.045 align:middle line:90%
by it.

00:42:22.045 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple
practice in theory,

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's not an easy
practice in application

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
because it requires
you to face up

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:36.475 align:middle line:84%
to all of the perspectives
you hate and judge so much.

00:42:36.475 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The example I give is
veganism versus carnivorism.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Meat eaters, non-meat eaters.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're a vegan
who's really triggered

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:90%
by people that eat animals.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And you think, man,
they're so heartless.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.105 align:middle line:90%
They don't love animals at all.

00:42:50.105 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil people.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.220 align:middle line:84%
My question for you
is, does the carnivore

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.520 align:middle line:90%
see themselves like that?

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Of course not.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
They would say,
well, I don't hate.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.600 align:middle line:90%
I love animals.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I have two dogs.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I have a cat.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I love animal.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't hate animals.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have an
imbalanced perspective.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You need to jump into the
perspective or the shoes

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the carnivore and
ask yourself questions

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
like why would someone
or how would someone

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
arrive at the belief that
it's OK to eat animals

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's not wrong?

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And you consider all the
arguments carnivores make,

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
which is, hey, the cycle
of life, death and rebirth.

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind of contemplate
how a carnivore thinks.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And you may find it
uncomfortable at first.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But the key is you don't have
to agree with the perspective.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you actually
shouldn't agree with it.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't agree
with any perspectives.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You should hold all
perspectives as equally

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.970 align:middle line:84%
valid from their own
position because everybody

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
thinks that they're right
from the perspective they're

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:90%
looking from.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So it does you no good
to be like, you're wrong.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But they don't think
they're wrong, buddy.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So you might as well try to
understand them rather than

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:90%
judge them.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing
it asks is that you

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:84%
come to an understanding
of that perspective.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Not that you agree with it,
but that you lose the ability

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:90%
to judge it any longer.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aaron, are miracles
created or do they just happen?

00:44:13.255 --> 00:44:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Of course,
miracles would

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:84%
say miracles take
place naturally

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.210 align:middle line:90%
as expressions of love.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And they say the real miracle
is the love that inspires them.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So I would say miracles
are a natural byproduct.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think a
miracle is something

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.140 align:middle line:84%
you can do with
effort in that sense

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:84%
because the one that
wants to do it with effort

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.220 align:middle line:84%
would be the ego who thinks
it's in control of I'll

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:90%
have a miracle.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll shift my perception.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But the course says
you really can't

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.770 align:middle line:84%
do that because
the same ego that

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.250 align:middle line:84%
holds the biased perspective
can't also shift it.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So instead, you gain that
devotional, open-hearted

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
attitude towards the divine.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And you just say, God,
I know I have judgments.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I know that I resent
people in my heart

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.610 align:middle line:90%
and I hold unforgiveness.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know that of my
own personal strength.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't get rid of these things.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So, God, I invite you to
help me heal these things.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And you invite in the Holy
Spirit, as the course would say.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the miracles
start to happen

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:84%
where maybe you encounter
that carnivore that

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:90%
would trigger you.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And this time, you don't
feel so much animosity,

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but you actually feel a warm
compassion towards them.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Even though you don't agree
with their carnivorism,

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:90%
you still love the person.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real miracle
is the internal shift that

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.780 align:middle line:84%
takes place that
you can only verify

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.760 align:middle line:84%
through your direct
experience of

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
do I actually feel
these things anymore

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.660 align:middle line:84%
towards these people
or situations?

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Life alone is the barometer
for our progression.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aaron, how do
people track your work?

00:45:46.548 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: I'm easy to find.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
You can find me at Aaron
Abke anywhere dot com,

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Instagram @aaronabke,
youtube.com/AaronAbke,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
or you can go to
4duniversity.com as well.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Thank you for
having me, George.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.815 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:46:01.815 --> 00:46:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We started the
program talking about karma.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe,
as Aaron has said,
