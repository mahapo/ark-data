I think many people today

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to

ROOSEVELT [RECORDING]:

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, December
7, 1941, a date

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:84%
which will live in infamy,
the United States of America

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
was suddenly and deliberately
attacked by naval and air

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:90%
forces of the Empire of Japan.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The United States was at
peace with that nation,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and at the
solicitation of Japan,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
was still in conversation with
its government and its emperor,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
looking toward the maintenance
of peace in the Pacific.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:10%
I believe that I interpret
the will of the Congress

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:10%
and of the people when I
assert that we will not only

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.266 align:middle line:10%
defend ourselves
to the uttermost,

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:10%
but will make it very certain
that this form of treachery

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:10%
shall never again endanger us.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:10%
But it truly changed
the face of this planet.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:10%
That was the event that
apparently pulled the United

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:10%
States into World War II.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But what really happened
behind the scenes?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Douglas Dietrich.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:10%
He is a historian.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:10%
He came to us via
"Coast to Coast Radio."

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
He was just a
caller at the time.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
You remember those
days, Douglas?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUGLAS DIETRICH: Yes.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And very much so.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very honored to be
here with you in person.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 1941, it was
a different era at the time,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Douglas, where
Americans rallied around

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
just about anything the
president would say,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
where nowadays, we're
a little more cautious.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:10%
We're a little more
suspicious-- weapons

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:10%
of mass destruction,
things like that.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:90%
What happened back in 1941?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And lead us up to the
events before the Japanese

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
attacked us.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Because even now, I
keep saying to myself,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese people
are brilliant people.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just
attack us to attack us.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
They knew better.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to wake
up a sleeping giant.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:90%
There had to be more to this.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.802 align:middle line:90%
Give us these events.

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Sure.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the initial
hints that the Americans were

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:10%
very concerned about the
Japanese expansion into Asia

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:10%
was with the
Soviet-Japanese Wars

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:10%
that were taking place
in 1937, '38, and '39.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
For three years in a row, there
were three massive conflicts

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
between the Japanese
and the Soviet Union.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:10%
And during that period
of time, Amelia Earhart,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:10%
more than likely, was
diverted during her flight

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:10%
across the Pacific
to find out what

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:10%
was going on in
that theater of war.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And more than likely,
she was assumed

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
to be a Soviet reconnaissance
pilot and shot down.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
For the forensics of
that, I would refer people

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to a book titled,
"Amelia Earhart:

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The Truth At Last," which
details her probable demise

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a
military-style execution

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
for someone who was
interpreted to be basically

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
a reconnaissance agent or a spy
who was conducting surveillance

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
from the air.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty
much at that point

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that both sides were made aware
of each other's intentions

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and provocations in the Pacific.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Things had been going on
long before that, of course.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:10%
We could trace it all back
to Commodore Perry basically

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:10%
forcing the Japanese,
under threat of invasion,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:10%
to open their doors to
American, shall we say,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:10%
investments in terms of merchant
communities and business

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:10%
activities.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is ultimately what
led to his flag being demanded

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
by the Japanese to be displayed
on the battleship Missouri

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
proactive hostilities--

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.243 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: --a time of
cessation of such back in 1945.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:10%
But by the time of 1941, between
Commodore Perry's black ships,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:10%
as they were known universally,
and their forced opening

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:10%
of Japan, there
were a lot of moves

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:10%
that made the Japanese feel
that they were being contained

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:10%
or essentially
strategically threatened

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:10%
by a lot of American presence.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:84%
We can see shades of
that later on during what

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.189 align:middle line:84%
we remember as the
Cold War, with what

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:90%
happened with the Soviet Union.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We can see shades of
that now happening

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
with America's attempts
to contain China

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and its expansion of naval
bases into the Indian Ocean,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and also America's
attempts to contain Iran

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
through many of its
bases in Central Asia.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, the Japanese
were far more threatened

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
than China or the
Soviet Union or Iran

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:84%
could ever be because the
Japanese are an island nation.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're entirely
dependent on maritime trade.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So as a result,
whatever impacted

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
them would be literally
a life or death

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
situation for the
quality of life.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their attack on
Pearl Harbor, Douglas,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.546 align:middle line:84%
was it what they thought
a preemptive strike?

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Very much
so, very much so.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it had been building
up for quite some time.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish-American
War led to the Americans

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
occupying the 7,100 islands
of the Philippines, which

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
they had gained
from the Spanish.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, I was born in Taiwan,
which at that period in history

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:10%
was an integral part of Japan.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:10%
And Taiwan and the Philippines
share maritime boundaries.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
This would be the same as
the Japanese conducting

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
a war with, say, the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
ruled the Cactus Throne
and occupying Mexico,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:90%
south of the American border.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans also
set up a dictator.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was literally referred to
as such upon his assassination

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
in the city of San Francisco,
where I live today.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:10%
His name was Durham
White Stevens.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:10%
And Durham White
Stevens was an American

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:10%
who was made the ruler of Korea.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The Americans had invaded and
occupied the Korean Peninsula.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
This man was set up as
basically the administrator.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Koreans assassinated him
in front of the Ferry Building

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So when he was assassinated,
the New York Times

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
referred to him as the
American Dictator of Korea.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Now this would have been similar
to the Japanese setting up

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
a puppet administrator
in Canada.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the Korean Peninsula
is so close to Japan

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that you could drink
a beer or a soda pop,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:84%
throw the aluminum
can into the ocean,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and it'll wash up on the
beach of the other nation.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
That's how close they are.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
These are direct parallels
to America's borders

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:90%
being compromised.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So the Japanese felt
very threatened.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And then it got worse.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.104 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they try to
negotiate at all, Douglas--

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --while
this was going on?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.328 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yeah.

00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
For a very long period of
time, there were, of course,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
misunderstandings.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was justifiable
American concern

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
over atrocities in
the China conflict.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese, of course,
had invaded China in order

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.525 align:middle line:84%
to establish a market
on the mainland.

00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's that hatred
between those two nations now.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Was immense.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to
remember that there was also

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of cooperation
between them.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The politics was
very complicated,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because China was in
meltdown at the time.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to modernize.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Qing dynasty
had collapsed.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So there were literally three
republics on the mainland.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
There was the Communist
Republic-- the insurgency.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Mao Tse-tung.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.215 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Yes, that
is quite correct.

00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And there was, of course, the
Nationalist Chinese Government,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.639 align:middle line:84%
into which nation state I was
born on the island of Taiwan.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chiang Kai-shek.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.055 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: That's
quite correct.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there
was what was known

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
as the Imperial
Republic of Yuan Shikai.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
the oldest republic.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was the largest republic.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was the republic
whose capital was in Beijing.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The other two, Mao Tse-tung
after the Long March

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
had retreated to
the Yenan Mountains,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
whereas Chiang
Kai-Shek had relocated

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
his capital to Chongqing.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But the capital in
Beijing declared war

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
on the United States in 1941,
along with the Japanese.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was known
as the Imperial

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Republic of Yuan Shikai.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Han
ethnic Chinese warlord

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:84%
who had declared
himself the new emperor

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
after the fall of
the Qing dynasty.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.215 align:middle line:84%
So that's an aspect
of that culture

00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that many people
aren't aware of.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
My mother was half
Chinese, half Japanese.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And her father was Chinese,
but he had married her mother

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
in Tokyo, the capital
of the Japanese Empire.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And this was at a
time where there

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.895 align:middle line:84%
was cooperation between
elements of the Chinese

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Japanese to the point
where such a marriage could

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:90%
take place.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, where
did it break down

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
with their decision to
attack Pearl Harbor?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
they knew we were

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:90%
going to come back full boat.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That's correct.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:90%
That's very correct.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
some of the mechanics

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
of the operational
matrix of the attack.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
what led up to it,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the Americans experienced
a massive sea change

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
under the Roosevelt
administration.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
the American public

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
was much more homogeneous
in its identity

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:90%
at that period of time.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that
the American public,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
even at a period of time when
there was a lot of homogeneity,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
was actually very
divided in terms

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of how to respond to all of
the heart-stopping events that

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
were taking place
across the Atlantic

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and across the Pacific.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Many people were isolationist.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Many people were divided
along the party lines.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened was
we had a massive depression.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And there were
new movements that

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
were taking place in
the United States,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:84%
like the emergence of
communism and fascism

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that the American public
was dealing with, as well.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that many people today

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
are very unaware of,
is just how divided

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
the Americans were at that time.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Now during that period
of intense negotiations,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:84%
when Roosevelt ascended to power
in 1933, the exact same year

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
that Adolf Hitler did,
he took the Americans

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
off the gold standard.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And this was his attempt
to print money to the point

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
where he could print us
out of the Depression.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And by taking us off
the gold standard,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
he did something that
essentially made the US dollar

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the most liquid
currency in the world.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
the rest of the world,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
except for peoples of the
nations such as Italy,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
or Germany, or Japan and their
allies, such as Thailand,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
which had its own emperor,
such as the Romania, Hungaria,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
many of the Balkan and
Eastern European nations

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that were beneath the
German exchange rate

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
system of the reichsmark
at that time--

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
except for communities such
as that that were economically

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
autarchic, the
majority of the world

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
pegged their currency
to the US dollar.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As they
still have to date.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: To this
date, that's right.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
There are many arguments
now about changing it

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.824 align:middle line:90%
to the euro or the yuan.

00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see what happens
in the near future.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But we're entering, again,
very dangerous times, which

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so important
to understand this history.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the pattern.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And at that time,
what had happened was

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:10%
there was a Canadian citizen by
the name of Lauchlin Currie who

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:10%
had graduated from the
London School of Economics

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:10%
but was a proven and
verified Soviet agent

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:10%
who had been identified
and outed by the FBI.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
This individual became
the economic adviser

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
to President Roosevelt.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.798 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: President
Roosevelt was

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
made aware of this
man's status by the FBI

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:90%
and chose to ignore it.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
when the FBI moved in

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to arrest Lauchlin
Currie, Roosevelt

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
transferred him on a
diplomatic mission to China.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get him
out of the country.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.429 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: To get him
out of the country.

00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:10%
And he stayed there for months,
representing the United States

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:10%
with Mao Tse-tung's
Communist insurgency

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:10%
through their foreign-relations
expert, Zhou Enlai.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I
remember, he followed

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Mao Tse-tung when
Tung died, right?

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:84%
He was going to be
the heir apparent.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But things changed
radically during the Nixon

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the
capitalist roader

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
took over, who was
Deng Xiaoping--

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
took over in China
after Mao Tse-tung

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and took China down the
road that it's taken today.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
that period of time,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Zhou Enlai and Mao Tse-tung
were die-hard collectivists.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
Nationalist Chinese

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
felt very betrayed by
what Roosevelt had done.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
He was obviously
supporting the Communists.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what ultimately led to
another phase of the Civil War,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.154 align:middle line:84%
during which the National
Chinese were ultimately

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
forced to retreat to Taiwan.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again, this
is pre-Pearl Harbor.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.663 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes, that's correct.

00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And during that
period of time, there

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of hostility
between the United

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.829 align:middle line:90%
States and the British Empire.

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
aren't aware of this.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over this?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: No.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It was over Roosevelt actually
bullying the British Empire

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
prior to Winston Churchill
assuming the prime ministry.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Now Winston Churchill
was very, shall we say,

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:84%
resented in the British
culture of the elites

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:90%
because he was half American.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
His mother was Jenny Churchill.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%
She was a US citizen.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But the monarchy did their
best to get him into power.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
machinations which ultimately

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
helped to establish him in
power as a wartime leader.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they were so threatened
by Roosevelt at that time.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt was the former
Secretary of the Navy-- excuse

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.676 align:middle line:84%
me, Assistant
Secretary of the Navy.

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And during the time that
he was Assistant Secretary

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Navy, he perfected what
was known as War Plan Crimson.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
War Plan Crimson is something
that people can look up.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
It's public domain now
at this point in history.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But with War Plan
Crimson, Roosevelt

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
recommended the
invasion of Canada

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
so that America could use
all of Canada's resources

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and make itself truly a
global power along the lines--

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A military
invasion of Canada--

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:90%
our neighbors to the north?

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That's correct.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.431 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: And as a
matter of fact, in 1937,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
the Americans held a
massive series of war games

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and invested in the construction
of a series of military

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.765 align:middle line:84%
airfields near the
Canadian border--

00:16:33.765 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did not know that.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: --that
could've taken Canada out.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.535 align:middle line:84%
And their war games
were so immense.

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
They involved entire divisions.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And he mobilized
the National Guard.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
they were all marching

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:90%
around upstate New York.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And this was at a period in time
when the monarchy in Britain

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
was seriously
considering evacuation

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:84%
of the nation due to their
war with the Third Reich.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, if he had
invaded Canada simultaneously,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
the British monarchy would not
have had an immediate arsenal

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
of monarchy into
which to retreat.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:84%
They would have had to have
gone into the Pacific--

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Australia, New Zealand,
the Indian Raj.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did was they
bargained with Roosevelt,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and they gave him
the opium market

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
of China, which they
had come to dominate

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.342 align:middle line:90%
during the period of the--

00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The big money there.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And of course, many
people have heard

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.916 align:middle line:10%
of the Anglo-Chinese Opium Wars.

00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.123 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Distant
relative of mine--

00:17:31.123 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
my Chinese family
name is Lin-- so

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:90%
from my mother's father's side.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And Commissioner Lin
had fought the English

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:10%
during the Anglo-Chinese
Opium Wars.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
He was ultimately
driven into exile.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:90%
His career was destroyed.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
He's a famous figure
in Chinese history.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the
Chinese themselves,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
when the British conquered
Hong Kong, many other areas

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
of China, they forced
the Qing dynasty

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
to open themselves up to
the British opium trade.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And the British were
manufacturing cannonball-sized

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
balls of opium--

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.236 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:18:03.236 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: --in India, which
were being shipped into China.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And that entire
market, which had

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
floated the British
monarchy, was turned over

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the United
States established

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
what was known as CNAC,
the China National Aviation

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Corporation.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:84%
CNAC had a number of
Douglas DC-10s, DC-9s,

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
various other
civilian airplanes.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It has to be remembered
that China's road and rail

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
system was very underdeveloped.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.955 align:middle line:90%
China was a nation that relied--

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was poverty, the
whole country, wasn't it?

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Much of it,
except for the coast.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The coast was very
wealthy, but many people

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
languished in poverty.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of inland China
was rural and basically

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:90%
subsistence farming.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.947 align:middle line:84%
That was why the Communists were
able to rally the peasantry.

00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: But in terms of
what was going on economically,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
the reason that
communism and nationalism

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and the new Han imperialism
cooperating with Japan--

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:84%
the reason all these
movements manifested

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
was because of the Chinese
destruction of its civilization

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
under the opium trade.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But what made the
British empire so wealthy

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.445 align:middle line:84%
was now being turned over to
the United States, basically--

00:19:17.445 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it reluctantly?

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Very
much so, but it was

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.894 align:middle line:10%
to keep the US from invading.

00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting what
goes on behind the scenes.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.101 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Very much so.

00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying is
what people can easily

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
vet at this moment and
this period in time

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
is public domain.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it hasn't been
taught in history books.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But Roosevelt was very much a
threat to the British Empire.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Had he invaded Canada, he would
have launched a World War.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
In order to prevent the monarchy
from fighting on two fronts,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%
they gave him the opium trade.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And they put
Churchill into power

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to basically direct
Roosevelt's hostilities

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
against the Japanese and the
Germans and the Axis nations.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that period of
time, Churchill basically

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
wasn't even in power at
the time that the Americans

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
had established
CNAC to transport

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
the opium with these
massive cargo planes.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Now the Japanese, of
course, interdicted

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%
them-- were shooting them down.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led
to the establishment

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
of the American volunteer group
the American Flying Tigers as

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%
escorts to CNAC.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:10%
They were flying Chinese
colors throughout the time

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:10%
that they were in conflict
with the Japanese, which

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:10%
had degenerated into
an all-out war by 1937.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Now my father was a US
serviceman, a sailor.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
He fought in World War
II, Korea, and Vietnam.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
All three of those wars
are on his tombstone

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:90%
in upstate New York.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But the reason
that his experience

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is so pivotal to
this was because he

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
was in theater with the China
gunboat patrols at the time

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that the war really
started, which

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:90%
was December 13th of 1937.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And at that period of
time, the Nanjing Massacre

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:90%
was taking place.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was a period of time in
which Communist guerrillas had

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
struck at the Nationalist
Chinese and Japanese peace

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:90%
talks.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Japanese
felt that they had

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:84%
been betrayed
under oath of honor

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
reacted monstrously

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to what they perceived as
betrayal by the Chinese,

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
until they finally found out
that many people had sighted

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Caucasians in ink-blackened
Chinese coolie uniforms that

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:90%
had fired on the negotiations.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the Japanese
retaliated by bombing.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't know
whether the Caucasians

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
were British or American.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They bombed both the USS
Panama and the HMS Ladybird.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
period of time

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that the Americans and
Japanese disintegrated

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
into all-out hostilities
on the Chinese mainland.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So whenever my father came home
on leave, people would ask him,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
how's the war going
with the Japanese,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
just the same way people would
ask somebody returning home

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
from the protracted conflict
in Korea or Vietnam.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So the Americans were
already well aware

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that there was a great hostility
between Japan and the United

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But they were as shocked by
the attack on Pearl Harbor

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.480 align:middle line:84%
as if the Koreans
or the Vietnamese

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
had attacked during
one of those conflicts.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
What makes it so tragically
ironic, of course,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
is that Hawaii was not
a US state at that time.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It would not be a US
state until 1959, well

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:90%
after the Second World War.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But at the time that
the Japanese attacked,

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
there was a military base there
where bombers were assembling.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was most
definitively part

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of the pattern that was
leading to a Japanese attack.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Now it's important to remember
that these bombers were not

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
going straight to Japan
from Pearl Harbor.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
They were going
from Pearl Harbor.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They were being shipped with
the 19th Bombardment Group

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to Clark Field in
the Philippines,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
where MacArthur was in charge.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were also being
shipped from there, thenceforth,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:90%
into the China theater.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Now what happened was
that President Roosevelt

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
signed a document
that was JB 355.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And the JB stood
for "Joint Boards,"

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:84%
which was the
equivalent back then

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So as the executive
commander-in-chief,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt basically
committed himself

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:84%
as the preeminent war
criminal of the 20th century

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
by conducting conspiracy
to conduct war

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
in an aggressive
fashion-- exactly

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
what the
nationaal-socialistische

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:84%
at Nuremberg were tried for
and exactly what the Tokyo War

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Crimes trials were held for.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So with JB-- the
Joint Boards-- that

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
implies, as well, that it has
the signatures on that document

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.772 align:middle line:84%
of the Secretary of the
Navy, the Secretary of War.

00:24:14.772 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It was reviewed by all these
responsible parties, including

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
the Secretary of the Army.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And so all of them
conspired to bomb Japan.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So JB 355 is public domain
at this point in history.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
People can look that up.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is an order
from Roosevelt

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to fly out of China,
using Chinese colors,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to bomb the Japanese.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the equivalent of,
say, if Barack Hussein Obama,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
our current executive, if he
ordered Blackwater to dress up

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
in Iraqi uniforms
and invade Iran.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It would be that criminal.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Now this was--

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.114 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not too far
fetched, either, as a plan.

00:24:55.114 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very frightening.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It's very frightening,
these parallels in history.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
As a result, the
Japanese decided

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:90%
on a preemptive surgical strike.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:11.111 align:middle line:84%
And they caught the bombers wing
to wing-- wing tip to wing tip.

00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
Sunday, wasn't it?

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: It was.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
they were so close

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
together was, basically,
they were ready for shipping.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so these were bombers
that were going to be shipped.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.165 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of
MacArthur, where they

00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
are a day ahead of time across
the International Date Line,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:90%
it was the 8th.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Pearl Harbor is known as
the December 8th attack

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the Pacific.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:84%
He was-- literally
had his planes

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
on the tarmac, wing
tip to wing tip,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
because they were being
fueled and armed to bomb

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Taiwan, the part of Japan
in which I was born.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And they caught
them on the ground

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed the entire
19th Bombardment Group.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And as for Hawaii, of course,
they were ready for shipment,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:90%
so they were unarmed.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Now at that time, it's
important to remember

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that the Americans had already
broken the Japanese codes.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The diplomatic codes
had been broken

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.304 align:middle line:90%
by British Intelligence in 1937.

00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they knew
what was going on.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.386 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Well,
the British were

00:26:14.386 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
able to-- they gave the
codes to the Americans.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they knew what was
going on diplomatically.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The naval security group-- the
Americans, the United States

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Navy-- their intelligence
broke the Japanese naval codes

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
in January of 1941, obviously,
functionally a full year

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
before Pearl Harbor.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So they knew of the attack
and the radio communications.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So what the Americans had
organized for was an ambush.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt did not want
to look like a fool.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want a scenario
of "at dawn we slept."

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the scenario
of "at dawn we fought."

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, he
set up an ambush.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So all three of the
carriers deployed

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
on the very day of
the December 7 attack.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.525 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Saratoga, the
Lexington, and the Enterprise.

00:26:59.525 --> 00:27:03.534 align:middle line:10%
The Enterprise was under command
of Admiral "Bull" Halsey.

00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.484 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: And he was very
much a part of the conspiracy.

00:27:09.484 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
to remember that this

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
was, in a very real sense, a
Federal Reserve conspiracy.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Because Lauchlin Currie
was the economic adviser

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to the president.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the things he
was responsible for

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
was getting us out of Depression
by preparation for war--

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:90%
by mobilization.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, on
September 11 of 1941,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.766 align:middle line:10%
prior, obviously, to
the December 7 attack,

00:27:35.766 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:10%
the man who would
later be responsible

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:10%
for the atomic bomb,
General Leslie Groves,

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:10%
was turning the spade
of dirt underneath him

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:10%
in the ground-opening
ceremony for the Pentagon.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: And on
September 11th of 1941,

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
right across the Potomac
River, Charles Lindbergh

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:84%
was protesting the
New World Order.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
Americans very much

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:90%
were mobilized for hostilities.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:84%
That's how the government
was able to get away

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
with so much of what it did.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:10%
For instance, in
building the Pentagon,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:10%
they cleared away a ethnic
African-American neighborhood,

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Hell's Bottom, made thousands
of African-Americans homeless.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:10%
But the men were told
to join the military,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:10%
because there was a war coming.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And they knew there was a war
coming because the Pentagon was

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
built entirely of concrete--
not a single scrap of steel.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
There was no steel cables for
elevators, no steel frame.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
All of it was concrete, because
they needed all the steel

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.086 align:middle line:90%
for tanks, and guns--

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:37.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And ships and things.

00:28:37.335 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: --and
ships, and rifles.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
the Golden Gate Bridge

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco, where I
live, used to have a monorail.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That was derailed-- literally
taken off and removed--

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:90%
towards this project.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was very shortly
around that time

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
that Roosevelt actually
said publicly, he said,

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.556 align:middle line:84%
I am going to
dedicate $100 billion

00:29:00.556 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:84%
to building thousands
of warplanes.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Now can you imagine our current
executive commander-in-chief

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:90%
coming to us?

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
The World War II-- $100
billion-- the equivalent today

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.125 align:middle line:90%
would be trillions of dollars.

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.166 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trillions, sure.

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: It would
be like Obama saying,

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dedicate
trillions of dollars

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:90%
to building warcraft.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Everyone would demand
his institutionalization.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They would say
this man's insane.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
But Roosevelt was able to
get away with it at that time

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
because he had such a lock
on the American economy

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
through the New Deal and
providing people with jobs.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
Federal Reserve.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.384 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: That's
quite correct.

00:29:36.384 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And Lauchlin Currie had
strengthened the Federal

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Reserve.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.996 align:middle line:84%
Secretary of the
Treasury, Morgenthau,

00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
as the Secretary
of the Treasury,

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
was actually
running a great deal

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:90%
of America's foreign policy.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one who actually
recommended that Roosevelt not

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:84%
accept Jewish emigres
from the Third Reich.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a number of
people that were obviously

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
very negative in
their influence.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the American
public was very much on guard

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
because the rest of
the world was at war.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, they were
responsive to this extremely

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
bellicose nature of
their leadership.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was the
rest of the world, of course,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.060 align:middle line:84%
was looking at this as America's
preparing to strike, but where?

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And the Japanese found out.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, of
course, they counterattacked.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans were prepared
to ambush them and make them--

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
pretty much wipe out
the Japanese fleet

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the war.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That didn't happen.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.564 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: No, it did not.

00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when the Japanese
arrived at Pearl Harbor,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
the Enterprise had
already deployed

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
a number of dive bombers
on Midway Island.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
People can look this up.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the order of
battle that did take place.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And these were ship killers.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
These were torpedo planes.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:84%
As they say, fighter
pilots make movies,

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:90%
but torpedo pilots make history.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.459 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of these ship
killers set up at Midway,

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
attack the Japanese task

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
force from the north.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And another bunch
of ship killers

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.660 align:middle line:84%
had been set up on
Wake Island that

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
were going to box the
Japanese in from behind.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Now all of this was supposed
to look really good on camera.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The Americans were supposed
to become outraged.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were going to
wait for the three strikes

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
before they struck and
took out the task force.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese codes had
informed them, by their reading

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and decrypting them,
that the Japanese were

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
three-way of assault.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Now when the Japanese got
there at Pearl Harbor,

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Fuchida Itsu, who
was the commander who

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:84%
led the first wave of the
attack, and his pilots

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:90%
couldn't believe what they saw.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And these were all
of the World War

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I battle wagons lined up less
than half a thousand yards

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:84%
from each other like
ducks in a row at anchor.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
That would be the way that you
see a mothball fleet anchored.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
They had never seen anything
like it-- even ships

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:90%
set up for review.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:90%
They knew it was a trap.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
They reported that
back to Yamamoto,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
who ordered a retreat
after the second wave.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Hit them and go.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Right.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because he knew that if he
stayed around for a third wave,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:90%
it would be too long.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
He was determined to
hit them, because that's

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:90%
what he had come there to do.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
there was no point

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in leaving without doing
damage and making a statement.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say
making a statement

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
is because it's
important to remember

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Japanese were, as
barbaric as their atrocities

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:84%
were on the mainland in
China, when they were fighting

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.040 align:middle line:84%
with the European powers,
they wanted to maintain

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.220 align:middle line:84%
a sense of chivalry,
if for no other reason

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
than the cynical politics
of public relations.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And because Hawaii was
an occupied territory,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to make sure not
to alienate the native public--

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous
population of Hawaii--

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
which was actually
quite multinational.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the firefighting teams
that fought the fires at Pearl

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Harbor was a firefighting team
of Japanese-American women.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many were Japanese.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:09.903 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: And so the
point that the Japanese

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:84%
were making was more to appeal
to the population of Pearl

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Harbor, that they were
fighting an American occupant.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it a
mistake, attacking

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Pearl Harbor, in retrospect?

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: One could
argue about that.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, after
careful analysis,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say no because
the Japanese were conducting

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
a preemptive strike.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It was only rendered a
ineffective preemptive strike

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
because their codes
had been broken.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But had their codes
not been broken,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.340 align:middle line:84%
they probably would have
done a much more severe blow,

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:90%
as they could have.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
Japanese had analyzed it.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a tremendous
fuel depot--

00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.752 align:middle line:84%
Oahu-- known as the Oahu
fuel depot farm, basically.

00:34:00.752 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It was general knowledge
where it was at.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could hide it.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
These were enormous
container tanks.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.810 align:middle line:10%
Had the Japanese struck that,
they would have not only

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.748 align:middle line:10%
literally blown
away Oahu as a port,

00:34:12.748 --> 00:34:15.289 align:middle line:10%
they would have set flames going
that would have consumed all

00:34:15.289 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of the fuel and pretty much
denied the native population

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:10%
much of its supply of
heating through the winter

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.090 align:middle line:10%
and various other heating
for any necessity--

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:10%
medical, et cetera.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:10%
So they didn't want to do that.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:10%
So they struck only
military targets.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But had they struck
the fuel dump,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:84%
they could have easily deprived
the Pacific fleet of fuel

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:90%
to counterattack.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.551 align:middle line:84%
And the Pacific
fleet, of course,

00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:40.550 align:middle line:84%
was bombing the Gilbert
and the Marshall Islands

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.763 align:middle line:90%
within 60 days.

00:34:42.763 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
Had they taken out
that fuel dump,

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.090 align:middle line:84%
they could have interdicted
American fuel ships trying

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.592 align:middle line:90%
to resupply the Pacific fleet.

00:34:48.592 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And they could have
delayed an American counter

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:90%
offensive for 18 months.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Douglas, when
we entered the war,

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
did we enter it knowing we would
have atomic weapons in four

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:90%
years after that?

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: That's a
very interesting point.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.480 align:middle line:90%
No, we did not.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.890 align:middle line:84%
What had happened
was that as soon

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
as Einstein had developed the
E equals MC squared equation,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
every physicist
in the world knew

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that this could lead to a
tremendous concentrated release

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
of energy in the form of what
was then called a physics bomb.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:84%
People incorporated that into
science fiction novels as early

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:90%
as the 1920s.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before we had them.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.185 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: That's
quite correct.

00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And people can look up old
pulp science fiction novels,

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
describe nuclear exchanges

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
where cities are left
glowing in the dark.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a great general
understanding of the concept.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
This was nothing new to the
American people or anyone else.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But the scientific adviser
to President Roosevelt,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Enrico Fermi, argued that it
would take 100 years in order

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to get to the
point of technology

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.879 align:middle line:84%
where we could develop
an atomic bomb.

00:35:49.879 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boy, was he off.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.586 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:35:51.586 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:10%
And the Axis, on the
other hand, started

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:10%
developing them right away.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans,
of course, were

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
left way behind until Einstein,
along with many Jewish emigres

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:84%
scientists, lobbied that
a atomic bomb project get

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
started because the
Axis was way ahead.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So that was launched.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans had to
work with the plutonium bomb.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
See, the uranium
is what the Axis

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
worked with because it was a
much more readily available

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The plutonium was
the rarest source

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:90%
in the world at that time.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the entire
known world supply of plutonium

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.635 align:middle line:84%
was in a single vile
that, because of--

00:36:31.635 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it?

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.748 align:middle line:84%
That because of the
pressure in the vile,

00:36:34.748 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
exploded in the hands
of a technician named

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Don Mastick, who inhaled it all.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And as a result--

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sure he died, huh?

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: No.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:90%
He lived to be 89 years old.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did?

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.843 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Because the entire
world supply at that time

00:36:45.843 --> 00:36:47.630 align:middle line:10%
was literally a few molecules.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.350 align:middle line:10%
And so it was so
little that it didn't

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.122 align:middle line:10%
go through his digestive tract
into the rest of his body.

00:36:53.122 --> 00:36:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He lucked out there.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes, he did.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But the point was that they
boiled all of his fecal matter

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:90%
and urine to retrieve it.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the smell was so bad
throughout Los Alamos

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as they
invaded Tinian Island

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and set up the
atomic bomber wing,

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.756 align:middle line:84%
he was the first civilian
transported to Tinian Island

00:37:12.756 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:84%
so they could continue boiling
his fecal matter and urine

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve the plutonium.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Just because the
smell was driving Oppenheimer

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:10%
and all the rest of
the scientists mad.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's how desperate
the American effort was.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It was so far
behind, so desperate,

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that that's what they
had degenerated to.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The Axis, on the other
hand, was way ahead.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But everyone knew
about atomic weapons.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knew this was
going to be a nuclear war.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted us
in to fight the Germans.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Was this the excuse?

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.426 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: The
American administration,

00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:10%
obviously, under Roosevelt,
because as I described,

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:10%
they were ready
to invade Canada,

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:10%
he seemed-- there's no other
way to really define him--

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:10%
he seemed maniacal enough where
he wanted war with anybody.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to mobilize
the American economy.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.500 align:middle line:84%
He thought war was
the way to do it.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So it seems almost
as if he didn't

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.040 align:middle line:90%
care who he went to war with.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:90%
So he was provoking everyone.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And that included the Germans.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Because he was providing
the British a lot of supply.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:84%
American ships were engaging
in contact, in terms of combat,

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:90%
with German U-boats.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.384 align:middle line:90%
They invaded Greenland.

00:38:16.384 --> 00:38:17.925 align:middle line:84%
The United States
invaded Greenland--

00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: --prior
to Pearl Harbor.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.306 align:middle line:84%
And they invaded and
occupied Greenland,

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
which made them a direct
strategic threat to the Reich.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And people can look this up.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Greenland was under
occupation by American troops.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
The Danish, because it
belonged to Denmark,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:90%
the Danish Embassy protested.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:90%
They were ignored.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So the Americans were
very much aggressive.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of Roosevelt
and his intentions,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Churchill simply
directed them in a way

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.455 align:middle line:84%
that was ultimately beneficial
to the British Empire.

00:38:45.455 --> 00:38:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Churchill kind of
tempered him, didn't he?

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.246 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
He tempered him and, for lack of
a better word, manipulated him.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because Roosevelt was
obviously not sane

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in the functional sense
we would consider today.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
If he were alive today, he
would be dismissed as readily

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.684 align:middle line:90%
as any fascist dictator--

00:39:05.684 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Yeah, who was,
in terms of his speechifying.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
People tend to think of him
as much more controlled today.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But many of his quotes
have been erased

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:90%
from just public history.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They're out there, and
they're accessible,

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:84%
such as the one that I
gave you, where he said,

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.459 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to spend $100 billion
dollars to build war planes.

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He appeared to
be loved by Americans.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: He was not
prior to Pearl Harbor.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:84%
After Pearl Harbor,
then everyone--

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.589 align:middle line:84%
including many
Americans who really

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:84%
felt that he was an out-and-out
Communist, because of the way

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.820 align:middle line:84%
he was treating people like
Lauchlin Currie-- many people

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:90%
rallied behind the flag.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They respected the position
of the commander in chief.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But he still had many
people who resented him

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.710 align:middle line:84%
because of the enormous
damage that he had done with,

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:84%
say for instance,
his vice president,

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Wallace, who was a
card-carrying Communist.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
President Truman

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:84%
became vice president
literally about a month

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:84%
prior to the dropping
of the atomic bomb.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
He had never met
President Roosevelt

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:84%
once in his entire
career as vice president

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.194 align:middle line:90%
other than for two photo ops.

00:40:13.194 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:84%
They knew they had
to get rid of Wallace

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:90%
because Roosevelt was dying.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And if Roosevelt died--

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they didn't
want him as president.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That's right.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.208 align:middle line:10%
Because then they would have
an actual member of the Soviet

00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:23.447 align:middle line:10%
Communist Party as president
of the United States.

00:40:23.447 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Unheard of.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.613 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: And so they knew
they had to get rid of him.

00:40:26.613 --> 00:40:27.865 align:middle line:90%
So they pushed in Truman.

00:40:27.865 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
to remember that

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the matrix
of the attack itself,

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.930 align:middle line:84%
probably the most
tragic thing to come out

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of it was the sacrifice of the
sailors and the willingness

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that the executive
commander in chief had

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in sacrificing them towards
his own cynical political ends.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:10%
And we have to remember that he
put in a man known as Elmer H.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.440 align:middle line:10%
Davis in charge of
what became known

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:10%
as the Office of
War Information.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And Elmer H. Davis was
responsible for propagandizing

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:84%
much of the hatred against
people of Japanese, Italian--

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hence the
internment camps?

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.541 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That's quite right.

00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And we all suffer from the
results of Pearl Harbor

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:90%
today in many different ways.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:10%
One of the ways in
which we suffered

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:10%
was the fact that the internment
camps for the Japanese

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:10%
was a situation where
their real estate,

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:10%
their financial property,
all of their assets

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.272 align:middle line:10%
were essentially seized.

00:41:28.272 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:10%
They were never--

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Law-abiding
citizens, right?

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.981 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: That's quite right.

00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the man who protested--

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.830 align:middle line:84%
one of the only men
of public stature

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:84%
who protested against
the internment

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.045 align:middle line:90%
was J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI.

00:41:42.045 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hoover?

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.640 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Yes, who said there
was absolutely no evidence

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:10%
that any member of the
Japanese-American community

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.070 align:middle line:10%
was acting in espionage.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:49.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: And the
Department of the Navy,

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:10%
to their credit,
which had operated

00:41:55.570 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:10%
in Japanese waters for many
years-- prior to Pearl Harbor,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.570 align:middle line:10%
the Japanese Navy actually
protested, as well,

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.631 align:middle line:10%
against internment
of Japanese citizens.

00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Douglas, how do you
feel about the use of those two

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:84%
atomic weapons on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Again, it
reveals our cynicism.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:16.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happened
when the Japanese-Americans

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:17.930 align:middle line:84%
were deprived of
their US citizenship

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and interned, all
of the citizenship

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:84%
was also deprived of
any Italian, German,

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.700 align:middle line:84%
or Japanese citizens who
were overseas at the time

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
that the war started.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason that
Hiroshima was bombed

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:84%
was because 20,000
Japanese-Americans

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of US citizenship, which
had been deprived them,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.284 align:middle line:90%
were gathered in Hiroshima.

00:42:39.284 --> 00:42:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that time?

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.241 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: At that time.

00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the Japanese government
put them in Hiroshima

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:84%
where they could have
their own community.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans knew that
they were a massive intelligence

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:54.320 align:middle line:84%
asset in terms of interpreting
American radio transmissions.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, they took out
20,000 Americans at Hiroshima

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.470 align:middle line:84%
who happened to be of
Japanese ethnicity.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So that shows us how
cynical that was.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It is important to remember
that these bombs did not

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:84%
have the effect that
many people realize.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
They did not have
any military effect.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:90%
They were weapons of terror.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.600 align:middle line:90%
They were weapons of terrorism.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the man who was

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.380 align:middle line:84%
in charge of Japan's
homeland defense

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.330 align:middle line:84%
was at the direct epicenter
of the atomic bomb.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to be in
a safe vault of a bank.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.170 align:middle line:10%
And he survived the blast
at point-blank range

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:10%
at ground zero.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:10%
And he emerged to tell the
emperor to continue the war.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But the
emperor said, no, I'm

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.091 align:middle line:10%
getting out of this, right?

00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: Actually,
that's not the case.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
days, hopefully, we

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:84%
can do an interview that
talks about the real situation

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:90%
concerning the end of the war.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But the emperor
demanded ultimately

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:90%
that the war continue.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tremendous
series of many threats

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
towards the United
States that resulted

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in the cessation of conflict in
the Pacific, one of them being

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:84%
biological warfare
that was going

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to be delivered
by balloon bombs.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.145 align:middle line:84%
>>DIETRICH: Here, to
the United States.

00:44:10.145 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example of
how powerful the balloon bomb

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:21.040 align:middle line:84%
weapon was, when the Americans
in the month of March of 1945

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
sent well over 300--
close to 400-- bombers

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
with incendiary bombs
to destroy Tokyo

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and to set it aflame-- by
the way, that destroyed

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.300 align:middle line:84%
far more people
in terms of lives

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:90%
lost than the atomic bombs did.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:10%
Now when the Americans were
bombing Tokyo, that very day,

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:10%
Emperor Hirohito deployed
a single balloon bomb.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:10%
And he deployed it through a
massive rain front, no less.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the Japanese had sent
thousands of balloon bombs

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.050 align:middle line:84%
beforehand to set
fires, by which they

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.470 align:middle line:84%
were able to measure the wind
currents of North America.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:90%
He had them mapped so well.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.650 align:middle line:84%
It's important to remember
he was a marine biologist.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:10%
And he studied the
Kuroshio, the Japan current,

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:10%
which goes across the Pacific
and only blows one way.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And because he knew it so
well, that single balloon bomb

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:84%
took out the power lines leading
to the Hanford Dam, which

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.662 align:middle line:84%
provided power to the
plutonium manufacturer.

00:45:15.662 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, it smashed
into it or something?

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yes.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It took them down, smashed
into them, took them out.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.330 align:middle line:10%
And it shut down the
Manhattan Project.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.049 align:middle line:84%
Not that he planned
to do that, right?

00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: He did.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.460 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.150 align:middle line:10%
And that way--

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did he have that
kind of pinpoint accuracy?

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That, he did.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they had been
setting fire for years

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to the Pacific Northwest.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Had they continued
to do so into 1946,

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:84%
the American Forest
Service themselves

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.920 align:middle line:84%
will tell you they would have
burned down the entire Pacific

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.567 align:middle line:90%
Northwest.

00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:44.275 align:middle line:90%
This is how bad--

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
Japanese-- they were

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.025 align:middle line:90%
attacking the mainland here.

00:45:47.025 --> 00:45:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: That's correct.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, we had
an all African-American group

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:10%
of military firefighters
known as the Triple Nickels,

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:10%
the 555th.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.724 align:middle line:10%
And the 5-5-5 was responsible
for putting out those fires

00:46:01.724 --> 00:46:03.140 align:middle line:10%
in terms of
professional response.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.972 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Incredible
historical information.

00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DIETRICH: Yeah.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And they were top secret.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.040 align:middle line:90%
No one knew about them.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
first American unit

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.490 align:middle line:84%
to not just be
African-Americans,

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.051 align:middle line:90%
but they had black officers.

00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why their
morale was so high.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What lessons did
we learn from all of that?

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.743 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: The
lesson that we learned

00:46:20.743 --> 00:46:23.010 align:middle line:10%
was when, unfortunately,
the internment camps were

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.900 align:middle line:10%
retroactively rendered
constitutional by the Supreme

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Court, that's what made it
legal to basically seize

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.720 align:middle line:10%
property and detain any
citizen without warrant,

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:40.490 align:middle line:10%
without proper cause,
without anything, anytime

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.000 align:middle line:10%
you wanted for
the US government.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So NDAA-- everything
that people are

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:84%
worried about today--
none of that matters.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:51.040 align:middle line:84%
This was all made legal by the
Supreme Court's retroactive

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.830 align:middle line:84%
rationalization of
the internment camp.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Since that period
of time, it has

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.300 align:middle line:84%
been legal for the US
government to do whatever

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to you as a citizen.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.410 align:middle line:90%
That's one major repercussion.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Another repercussion
is our oil dependency.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.400 align:middle line:10%
By getting us into the war,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.570 align:middle line:10%
gave away all of our
oil, via lend-lease,

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:15.210 align:middle line:10%
to the Soviet Union, to
China, to the British Empire.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.870 align:middle line:10%
Now keep in mind,
the British had--

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.130 align:middle line:10%
this was prior to undersea
development of oil.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So the British did not have
the North Sea Oil Fields.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union did
not have the technology

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to access its mass of
natural gas fields.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.570 align:middle line:84%
America was the Saudi
Arabia of the world.

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we were floating

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:84%
on top on practically
free oil that people

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.850 align:middle line:84%
were getting sweet
crude bubbling

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the ground.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.919 align:middle line:84%
In World War II, we used
billions of barrels of oil

00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because none of the
rest of the world

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.669 align:middle line:90%
had it, or easy access to it.

00:47:45.669 --> 00:47:47.293 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boy, things
sure have changed.

00:47:47.293 --> 00:47:48.439 align:middle line:90%
Douglas, we're out of time.

00:47:48.439 --> 00:47:50.480 align:middle line:10%
But I want to thank you
for being on the program.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.813 align:middle line:10%
>>DIETRICH: I want to thank you.

00:47:51.813 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:10%
And I would like people to check
into Revolution Radio, where

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.590 align:middle line:10%
I have my regular program,
so they can continue

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:10%
to hear me go into
detail on these subjects.

Sun."

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:10%
Definitely check into that.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.680 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure you'll be
satisfied with the real reasons

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.687 align:middle line:10%
behind that incident
and how it was involved

00:48:14.687 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:10%
with the war, which was
still ongoing at the time.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.394 align:middle line:90%
It didn't end until 1952.

00:48:18.394 --> 00:48:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Douglas.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:19.830 align:middle line:90%

things that we just

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:10%
didn't hear about
a long time ago.
