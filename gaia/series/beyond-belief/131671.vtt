00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.898 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to a special edition of "Beyond

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.485 align:middle line:84%
Belief"-- special because this
individual is probably one

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.738 align:middle line:84%
of the world's foremost
thinkers of life.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.406 align:middle line:84%
It's none other than our
dear friend David Wilcock.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:33.283 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:33.784 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Hey, George.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:34.284 align:middle line:90%
How are you, buddy?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.411 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always like
doing these shows with you.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.287 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Well, you say that.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.497 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
trust you, though.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.289 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nah!

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.374 align:middle line:90%
You don't trust me?

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.625 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, we're
kind of in competition,

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:84%
because we both have competing
shows on the same network.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but we're
on the same network.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:45.921 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's true.

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.714 align:middle line:84%
So it's all really
kind of a team effort.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.634 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I will
agree that you're

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
doing very well on this network,
and so that doesn't bother me.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.554 align:middle line:90%
At all.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:54.763 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Cool.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.139 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.475 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the best--
probably the best interviewer

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, in my opinion.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.021 align:middle line:84%
And I end up saying
things when you

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:84%
talk to me that just wouldn't
happen any other way.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:05.941 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.109 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We pull it
out of you, don't we?

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.194 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The legacy of
shows that you and I have

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.613 align:middle line:84%
done on "Coast" are the best
radio shows I've ever done.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:12.531 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We still get
people calling about this.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.741 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, yeah.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.117 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.033 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it grows.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.537 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's an exciting
time to be on the planet.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:22.374 align:middle line:84%
And what you bring
is this presence

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:25.627 align:middle line:84%
of such consistency over
so many years of holding

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
this legacy that really is
the crown jewel of the UFO

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.218 align:middle line:84%
community, bringing all
those talents together, all

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:90%
those people together.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.722 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how the heck you do

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:90%
it, George, night after night.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.226 align:middle line:84%
Not only do you have this
show, but you're also

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.395 align:middle line:90%
on the air working all the time.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.729 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have to do it, David.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.274 align:middle line:90%
We have to get the answer out.

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:52.696 align:middle line:84%
And people have been for
years involved in this area

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:56.491 align:middle line:84%
that we all love so dearly,
and that's disclosure.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.327 align:middle line:84%
That's to try to
get the word out.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.829 align:middle line:84%
And you've investigated
that with people

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.124 align:middle line:84%
like Corey Goode
and your own work.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Where are we today
with disclosure?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.669 align:middle line:90%
Are we getting closer?

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.005 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: There's a lot of
interesting things going on,

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.214 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.509 align:middle line:84%
You had the guy who was the
lead singer from Blink-182,

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:15.302 align:middle line:90%
Tom DeLonge--

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.511 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, Tom DeLonge.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.096 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --on your show.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.558 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
on your show that he

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:24.227 align:middle line:84%
leaked some very
provocative stuff,

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:28.065 align:middle line:84%
saying that he was in contact
with multiple insiders

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
from high levels of the
Pentagon and that they

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.239 align:middle line:84%
were saying that they wanted to
move forward with disclosure.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.283 align:middle line:84%
And you were there
interviewing him.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:42.537 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you, since we can both
kind of co-host and co-talk,

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.956 align:middle line:84%
tell me some of the things--
because this will help set up

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.833 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to say--
what were some of the things

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.377 align:middle line:84%
that Tom DeLonge was
saying on your show?

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he's
convinced-- and of course,

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.883 align:middle line:84%
from one of the greatest rock
groups out there at that time--

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.428 align:middle line:84%
he is convinced that the
people that have come to him

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.013 align:middle line:90%
were real.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.515 align:middle line:90%
I think that's important.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.183 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
important barometer.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.977 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to ascertain
whether these people are

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.146 align:middle line:90%
trying to trick you or not.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.815 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks that
they were very

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.068 align:middle line:84%
real, that we've been visited
since the beginning of time,

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:16.071 align:middle line:84%
that we have craft, that we
have reversed technology.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:19.658 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the
most telltale-y things that

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:22.577 align:middle line:84%
he's been able to say is
that there seems to be some

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:26.164 align:middle line:84%
unwritten agreement
between our government

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials for
some shared knowledge--

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.919 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's true.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
even shared people.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:38.343 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that the
abduction phenomenon is real.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.805 align:middle line:84%
We know about it,
and we can't stop it.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And to me, it's kidnapping.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.017 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, I
would agree with you.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.728 align:middle line:84%
I think that, as when you
had Corey on your show

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.398 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
the interstellar,

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.901 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic slave trade
that's going on here, that's

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.903 align:middle line:84%
one of the most disturbing
aspects of disclosure

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
to deal with as this

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:90%
all starts to come out.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not all
benevolent, is it?

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.451 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: No.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:84%
And George, you and I are
essentially frontiersman.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.041 align:middle line:84%
We're out there in the
Wild West with our six-guns

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.461 align:middle line:84%
at our side, where
there's no law and order.

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.588 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to make sense
out of this whole thing.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.797 align:middle line:90%
We're in new territory.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.341 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm Wyatt Earp,
you're Doc Holliday.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.759 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I'm Doc Holliday.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.307 align:middle line:90%
This is going to happen, George.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It's going to break out.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.023 align:middle line:84%
The Tom DeLonge thing shocked
me because it reveals a trend

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:37.819 align:middle line:84%
line in which the people that
are speaking the Tom DeLonge

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
are saying, we're ready to go.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.744 align:middle line:84%
We want you to help us get the
public acclimated to the truth.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is something
holding them back

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.624 align:middle line:90%
from going and telling us?

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.416 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I'm
waiting, and you're waiting.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I think they're
terrified because--

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.588 align:middle line:84%
and this is one
of the reasons why

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.257 align:middle line:84%
I think they've put some
big chips on the table

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
behind Tom DeLonge's
position, if you

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.844 align:middle line:90%
want to look at it as gambling.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:03.845 align:middle line:90%
They're gambling on him.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They've got a big pile of chips
in the poker game right there.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.933 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:12.187 align:middle line:84%
Because he's trying to
say, hey, look, everybody.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't mean to
do anything wrong.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.025 align:middle line:84%
They kept this a
secret because they

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.903 align:middle line:84%
were worried about the
collapse of society

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.613 align:middle line:90%
if we learned it too quickly.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.198 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things
that were going on,

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:26.785 align:middle line:84%
like abduction, are so
disturbing that people are not

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:30.205 align:middle line:84%
going to want to
hear this truth.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.831 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to want to have

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.001 align:middle line:84%
the truth, because the
truth is very uncomfortable.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.878 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
disclosure will

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
involve a mass trauma
in which many people who

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.845 align:middle line:84%
have up until now had a
great deal of ignorance

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.765 align:middle line:84%
about this issue are
suddenly discovering

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle line:84%
that the entirety of their
experience as a human being

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.062 align:middle line:90%
has been a lie.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.523 align:middle line:84%
And it's a nest of lies
within lies within lies.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.483 align:middle line:90%
It's just unbelievable.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have told
us on "Coast to Coast"

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.363 align:middle line:84%
a couple years ago--
and you were convinced--

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.658 align:middle line:84%
that President Barack
Obama was going

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.203 align:middle line:84%
to be flanked by a
couple ETs and was going

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.998 align:middle line:90%
to come forward and tell all.

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.165 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't happened yet.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.208 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: [SIGH]
That was the plan.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you
still believe it?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.213 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well,
here's what happened.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
That occurred in July 2009
while we were interviewing

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.552 align:middle line:90%
an insider named Pete Peterson.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:29.806 align:middle line:84%
And he had contacts with
three different people who

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
were at the very bleedingly
highest level of mainstream

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
network news and
network television.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.816 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say who they are

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:40.734 align:middle line:90%
or what networks they were from.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.234 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But real people.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.278 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I could probably
get him killed if I do.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.616 align:middle line:84%
But we had a lot of off-camera
discussion about this.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:52.078 align:middle line:84%
Every major cable channel
had a specific period of time

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.246 align:middle line:90%
that was booked out.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.831 align:middle line:84%
And I believe if I
remember correctly,

00:06:54.831 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle line:90%
the date was November 27, 2009.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:04.007 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly there was going
to be an announcement that

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:84%
involved five different
extraterrestrial groups, most

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of which look like us-- look
human, or at least humanoid--

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and there are
others that are not.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were apparently going
to step forward and reveal

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.856 align:middle line:84%
themselves to
humanity with Obama.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.525 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that we
really haven't covered

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.821 align:middle line:84%
that much-- I've mentioned it
a little bit-- was not only

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle line:84%
were there five black ops
groups that closed in on this

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:34.245 align:middle line:84%
once they found out about it
and made absolutely sure that it

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.955 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they did not
want this disclosure at all.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.834 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: No, no, no.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.212 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of groups that
stand to lose tremendously

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:46.257 align:middle line:84%
from this, because as soon
as we-- and I'll get back

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.802 align:middle line:84%
to the other story, but we'll
go off onto this for a second.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:53.556 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we reveal that--
where's my antigravity machine?

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.683 align:middle line:90%
Where's my land speeder?

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where's my
free electricity?

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.936 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Where's
my free energy?

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:01.356 align:middle line:90%
Where's my teleportation?

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where's my
longevity in life?

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:07.112 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, because no
disease is actually necessary.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.364 align:middle line:84%
No disease needs to
be suffered by anyone.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.074 align:middle line:90%
The technology already exists.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to have a
Pacific garbage patch.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
We could get rid of
all the stuff that's

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.455 align:middle line:90%
causing problems for the Earth.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:21.543 align:middle line:84%
California could
become a business state

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.963 align:middle line:84%
in which its largest
business that it exports

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.341 align:middle line:84%
is water, because we
already have technology that

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.052 align:middle line:84%
can desalinate
ocean water, create

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.847 align:middle line:84%
free energy in the
process, and the byproduct

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
will generate any element on the
periodic table that you want.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
just pipe it away.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.522 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: This was
discovered by MIT scientists.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.733 align:middle line:90%
And it is ready to go.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.111 align:middle line:84%
We could have a huge
water desalination

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.573 align:middle line:84%
turbines that power the
entire American power grid

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.615 align:middle line:90%
and export--

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.241 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, makes sense.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.117 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.036 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So look,
why don't they

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.496 align:middle line:90%
want us to know this stuff?

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.458 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
groups whose goal is

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle line:90%
what they call "depopulation."

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.671 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Depopulation,
control, and money.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.299 align:middle line:84%
I've always said,
David, follow the money,

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.967 align:middle line:90%
and you'll get your answer.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.761 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It actually
makes me pissed off.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.388 align:middle line:84%
I have a heart rate increase,
and my-- I feel this--

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, don't
get yourself sick.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.142 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I just-- George--

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
make me, then,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.812 align:middle line:84%
the highest-rated show on
the Gaia television network,

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.646 align:middle line:90%
though--

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.647 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: If I
actually lose it, right?

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:24.856 align:middle line:90%
On your show.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:25.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --if you were gone.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:26.441 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's unconscionable
that guys like you

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.199 align:middle line:90%
and me are considered fringe.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:37.702 align:middle line:84%
What could possibly be more
interesting than the stuff

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.204 align:middle line:84%
that you and I
are talking about?

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And realistic.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.625 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: What's more relevant
to everybody's daily life

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.462 align:middle line:84%
than this idea that there
are already beings here

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.173 align:middle line:84%
who are so advanced that they
have been able to largely

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.217 align:middle line:84%
conceal their
identities from us,

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.385 align:middle line:84%
only leaving us a
trail of breadcrumbs

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.846 align:middle line:84%
so that if you want
to find out, you can,

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.432 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't want the
truth, you can conveniently

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.892 align:middle line:90%
stay an ostrich.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.977 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't see
cases like we used to.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:06.314 align:middle line:84%
You know, Lonnie Zamora,
the dead New Mexico police

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.066 align:middle line:84%
officer-- now he's
passed on-- who

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
saw a craft and a
couple beings outside.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
We used to get cases of
burned-out areas, indentations

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.534 align:middle line:90%
where tripods would land.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.702 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we get that anymore?

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.371 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's
important to understand,

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.624 align:middle line:84%
George, that there
is a cosmic free will

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.417 align:middle line:84%
principle that these
extraterrestrials have

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
to follow.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.547 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard this from
ancient religious texts.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.299 align:middle line:84%
We've heard this from
modern revealed teachings

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.676 align:middle line:90%
like "The Law of One."

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:38.555 align:middle line:84%
We've also had things happening
like beings contacting Corey

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.391 align:middle line:84%
Goode directly, supposedly--
and I believe it's true--

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.351 align:middle line:90%
and telling him this.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:47.772 align:middle line:84%
These ETs are
essentially either going

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.483 align:middle line:84%
to fall into one of two
categories, primarily.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.361 align:middle line:84%
There are some that are
neutral, but not very many.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.822 align:middle line:84%
They're either
extremely benevolent,

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.741 align:middle line:84%
and they would be the equivalent
of angels in the Bible,

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.412 align:middle line:84%
or they are highly,
highly, highly evil.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As David
Jacobs would say.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.707 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yes.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:10.211 align:middle line:84%
And the most evil
of them are the ones

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.798 align:middle line:84%
who are essentially
looking like what

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.216 align:middle line:90%
we would think the devil is.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.467 align:middle line:90%
You've got reptilian skin.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.887 align:middle line:90%
You've got vertical slit pupils.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle line:90%
They're very large.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.973 align:middle line:90%
They could be 12 feet tall.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.934 align:middle line:84%
They apparently in some cases
actually do eat human beings--

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:25.727 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, great.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --which is
not something we want.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.611 align:middle line:84%
And they are living off
of the fear of humanity.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could there
be a combination

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.032 align:middle line:84%
of both the benevolent
and the evil?

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, what I'm saying
is we're being visited by both.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.454 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are
involved in our lives.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.624 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are
contacting people on Earth.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.001 align:middle line:84%
They have to start-- there's
certain laws in the universe

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.045 align:middle line:84%
where they have to
begin telepathically,

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.673 align:middle line:84%
but then they can transition
into an in-person contact.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.176 align:middle line:84%
So everybody, I would recommend,
if you haven't already

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.262 align:middle line:84%
seen it, go watch the "Cosmic
Disclosure" episode where

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
we bring in William Tompkins--

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia TV network.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah,
94-year-old guy who

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
was there in World War
II as a high ranking Navy

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.944 align:middle line:84%
debriefer of 29
embedded spies who

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.321 align:middle line:84%
were in the German secret
space program at the time.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.407 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And what
he revealed was

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:25.203 align:middle line:84%
that telepathic contact
with Reptilian ETs

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.665 align:middle line:84%
was established through
various German secret society

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.668 align:middle line:84%
groups like the Thule
Society, the Vril Society.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:35.922 align:middle line:84%
And it led to an
in-person physical contact

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:39.092 align:middle line:84%
in which these Reptilians,
or what they call the Draco,

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:43.721 align:middle line:84%
actually formed an alliance with
the Nazis to conquer not just

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.224 align:middle line:90%
the Earth but other worlds.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Now these beings--
these negative beings

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.981 align:middle line:84%
actually require fear
as a food supply.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic
nutrition that they get off

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of causing as much war and pain
and chaos on Earth as possible.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.863 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they're
doing a good job doing it.

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.866 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: This planet has
become an oasis for them.

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:10.873 align:middle line:84%
They are essentially living
off of our collective disease

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:11.749 align:middle line:90%
and our ignorance.

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.292 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
knowledge that you

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.254 align:middle line:90%
possess-- does it scare you?

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.672 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize
this, George.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.677 align:middle line:84%
The negative can only
do what it is authorized

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.762 align:middle line:90%
to do by our own free will.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:25.638 align:middle line:90%
Authorization is key.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.514 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are the rules.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.807 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Those are the rules.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So they have to tell
us what they're doing.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.144 align:middle line:84%
They have to hide
it out in the open.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.771 align:middle line:84%
One movie after
another after another.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.356 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't
already seen it, it

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.192 align:middle line:84%
was really pumped up by the
media, this big, big film--

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.569 align:middle line:90%
"Batman versus Superman."

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.029 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I haven't seen that.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.281 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Nobody did,
because the people who did

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.992 align:middle line:90%
were so disturbed, George.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.786 align:middle line:84%
The whole movie,
from the beginning,

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.789 align:middle line:84%
blatantly, in-your-face--
they take the glove off

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.875 align:middle line:84%
and they slap you
across the face.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.044 align:middle line:90%
Superman is Lucifer.

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:57.545 align:middle line:90%
Superman is the fallen angel.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.379 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.256 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do that?

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.467 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because
that's their religion.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.676 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To destroy an icon--

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: People don't
like the truth, OK?

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.347 align:middle line:90%
It's uncomfortable.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
It's unpleasant.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:84%
And so it's much easier to
attack guys like you and me.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.394 align:middle line:90%
That feels better.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.063 align:middle line:84%
That's how you can
suck your thumb

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.647 align:middle line:84%
and get into a fetal
position at night

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.566 align:middle line:84%
and-- "Oh, there's no
evil in the world!"

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:19.358 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.069 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heck, I
remember when I first

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.779 align:middle line:84%
came into "Coast
to Coast," David,

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.908 align:middle line:84%
after having nine years'
experience as a Navy officer,

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.577 align:middle line:84%
people would accuse me of
being a disinformation officer.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.369 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I know.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I laughed about it.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.708 align:middle line:84%
But they really
thought that-- that I

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:41.255 align:middle line:84%
was planted into the show
to create disinformation.

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:42.924 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Everybody
in our field

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.176 align:middle line:84%
is accused of being on the
take or that we're only

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.762 align:middle line:84%
doing this for money or
that we're only doing this

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.097 align:middle line:90%
because we want to be famous.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.973 align:middle line:90%
But the money is not there.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:52.558 align:middle line:90%
The fame is not there.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:57.188 align:middle line:84%
We're doing good enough that we
can live in Los Angeles-- you

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.815 align:middle line:90%
and I can live in Los Angeles.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.399 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like we're rich.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.318 align:middle line:84%
You're not pulling up
in a Rolls-Royce here.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:02.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.821 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's ridiculous,
the accusations we hear.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Far from that.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.657 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The
point is, George--

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: However,
would you get my car

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.494 align:middle line:84%
after this interview
is done, please?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.204 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I'll let
the butler do that.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.249 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:22.171 align:middle line:84%
I can't stop people from
being terrified of the truth.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.089 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop that.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:26.509 align:middle line:84%
But what I can do is I can
inform you about the truth

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
so that it's less scary once
you get the big picture.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.722 align:middle line:84%
So yes, let's get
right down to it,

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:36.185 align:middle line:84%
which is that there is a
very powerful super-entity

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.437 align:middle line:84%
of corporations
that are controlled

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:42.692 align:middle line:84%
by a central group
that is ultimately

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.443 align:middle line:90%
a Luciferian religious cult.

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We all
know their names.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.822 align:middle line:84%
We don't mention them
for fear of lawsuits

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.657 align:middle line:90%
because it's difficult to prove.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.033 align:middle line:90%
But they're out there.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.161 align:middle line:84%
They're the very
rich and famous.

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.204 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: They honestly
believe that Lucifer is

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.206 align:middle line:84%
the misunderstood,
benevolent hero--

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.043 align:middle line:84%
that that's actually God-- and
that the god that cast Lucifer

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:02.753 align:middle line:90%
out of heaven is the bad guy--

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:03.754 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is the bad guy.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:07.175 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --because
Lucifer pointed the whistle,

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.427 align:middle line:84%
blew the finger-- I can't
even talk right now.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
Satanic, aren't they?

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.182 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.893 align:middle line:90%
You're laughing.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.061 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because I meant
to say "blow the whistle,

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.606 align:middle line:84%
point the finger," but
I got a spoonerism,

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:22.982 align:middle line:84%
like when you say
"shake a tower"

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.734 align:middle line:90%
instead of "take a shower."

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.611 align:middle line:84%
My mind is off in other
dimensions, George.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:27.945 align:middle line:90%
I'm multiplexed out throughout--

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're under
a lot of stress and pressure.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.824 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: This
stuff does upset me.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
It's upsetting to talk about
this, because they're real.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.081 align:middle line:84%
They're as serious
as a heart attack.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And if it wasn't for
these universal laws,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:90%
they would have taken me out.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
they would have.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.047 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: They've tried
and tried and tried.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.508 align:middle line:84%
I have been given death threats
directly from the Rothschilds

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.927 align:middle line:90%
three different times.

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.304 align:middle line:84%
They have actually had somebody
that they could talk to--

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Straw parties?

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:56.974 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --where it's from
them through this person to me.

00:16:56.974 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
Three times, direct death
threats from the Rothschilds--

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.939 align:middle line:84%
shut up or we're
going to take you out.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:03.898 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still doing it.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.233 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're still doing it.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:08.152 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because what
they really try to do

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.446 align:middle line:84%
is they try to lure you in
with a honey trap that gets you

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:13.657 align:middle line:90%
to authorize your own death.

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:14.492 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.327 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you need
to be careful, and let

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.204 align:middle line:90%
me tell you why.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.915 align:middle line:84%
We are being plagued with
naturopathic doctors being

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:22.708 align:middle line:90%
murdered.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I know.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's happening
all around the country--

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:24.919 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I know.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --all around
the planet these days.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:30.049 align:middle line:90%
We have had biochemists killed.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.594 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Quayle and I have
talked about that for years.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
They're getting to
these people who

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
are those that would
be able to fight back

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.646 align:middle line:84%
with their knowledge of
alternative medicine and things

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:44.814 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.316 align:middle line:84%
And we've been having
these things happen,

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.653 align:middle line:84%
David, since the beginning
of time-- strange deaths

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
occurring around some
people who wanted

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.616 align:middle line:84%
to go public about some things
in the presidential campaigns.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:56.409 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Sure.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:57.994 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've died.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:03.124 align:middle line:84%
A person who they claim
committed suicide obviously

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.627 align:middle line:84%
they said got killed on his left
side, but he's right-handed.

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:07.837 align:middle line:90%
So-- I mean, who does that?

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.423 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And nobody took his
wallet or his keys or anything.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, nothing.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:11.674 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:13.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Just leave him there.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
claimed it was a robbery.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.512 align:middle line:90%
They robbed him of nothing.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:22.184 align:middle line:84%
So in your case, you
need to be careful.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.687 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's not
going to stop me.

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:25.479 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:26.606 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I'm going to
quote Abraham Lincoln.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.356 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't let them win.

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I think I did
this on your show before,

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.068 align:middle line:90%
but it's worth saying it again.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.154 align:middle line:84%
"I'd rather die once at
the hand of an assassin

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.282 align:middle line:84%
than die every day in
fear of assassination."

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:40.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could get one
thing disclosed right now,

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
beyond a shadow of
a doubt, what topic,

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.459 align:middle line:84%
what specific area
would that be?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.169 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, let
me give a thoughtful

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:52.048 align:middle line:84%
instead of a sarcastic answer,
because we could joke around

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.258 align:middle line:90%
all day.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.968 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've known
each other too much.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.553 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I would
want-- yeah, I know.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.346 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.181 align:middle line:84%
We've had parties at
some of these things,

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:04.101 align:middle line:84%
and wild things
have taken place.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.437 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I left before
the wild things took place.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.814 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, but you had
a few drinks in you, though.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:12.485 align:middle line:84%
And if you hadn't left,
it could have gotten bad.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.821 align:middle line:84%
We had some very interesting
and amazing women showing up.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.366 align:middle line:90%
And let's just leave it there.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.951 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:24.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you can reveal
one thing-- not about this,

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:27.124 align:middle line:84%
but you reveal one
thing that you've

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.751 align:middle line:90%
been working on all your life.

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.212 align:middle line:84%
What would it be, if you
could get that answer?

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.381 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Honestly,
I would want the world

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.382 align:middle line:90%
to know about ascension.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:38.636 align:middle line:84%
I would want the world to know
that we are very, very close.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.971 align:middle line:84%
And all the people on
the inside know this.

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the key of disclosure.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.309 align:middle line:84%
We are very close to some
sort of energetic shift

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.645 align:middle line:90%
that the Sun is going to do.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:51.065 align:middle line:84%
Our new insider William
Tompkins knows all about it.

00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Pete Peterson
knows all about it.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.443 align:middle line:84%
Every insider at
the highest levels--

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.279 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they concerned?

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It depends
on who you're talking to

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.242 align:middle line:90%
and where they are.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.829 align:middle line:84%
But what everybody
agrees on is that this is

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.748 align:middle line:90%
a massive consciousness shift.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:12.753 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you look
at the amount of validation

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.881 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the major
world religions, including

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.634 align:middle line:84%
the Islamic Bible,
the Quran, the Bible,

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.511 align:middle line:84%
obviously-- it's all
over the place in there.

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.929 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Torah.

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.265 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The Jewish Bible,
the Torah, you betcha.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:27.977 align:middle line:84%
It's in Buddhism, it's in
Hinduism, it's everywhere.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.938 align:middle line:84%
And yet how can we be
so ignorant about this?

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:34.608 align:middle line:84%
If there is some
sort of natural event

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:41.157 align:middle line:84%
that's going to take place that
takes our certainty of being

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:45.911 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual being and makes
it absolutely certain,

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.663 align:middle line:84%
where there's no
veil left, where

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:54.295 align:middle line:84%
we are wide open to reality and
our greater spiritual identity,

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.297 align:middle line:84%
I would want more people
to know about that

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.423 align:middle line:90%
so they can prepare for it.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:57.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.383 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because
these religious texts

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.969 align:middle line:84%
were intended to give you
thousands of years of lead time

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.846 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for it.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we're hearing is that
our own military-industrial

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.313 align:middle line:84%
complex has very powerful
ships now that can

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.607 align:middle line:90%
defeat the Reptilians, 100%.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're already doing that.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've created that.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.694 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: We've
created that here.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.822 align:middle line:84%
And this is from
several insiders now,

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:24.617 align:middle line:84%
the highest level stuff
that I can give you.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:29.038 align:middle line:84%
The Draco, the Reptilians, have
created these technologies,

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:30.664 align:middle line:84%
including these
gigantic tankers.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:33.334 align:middle line:84%
We're talking 2 and
1/2 mile long ships

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:36.253 align:middle line:84%
hovering in low Earth orbit,
cloaked so you can't see them.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:37.922 align:middle line:84%
But if you could,
they'd be right there,

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.965 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be gigantic--
covering the sky.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.509 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's in them?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.469 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Mind
control technology

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that is preventing us from
having this spiritual shift

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.516 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:51.185 align:middle line:84%
Our government, our military--
it's not really the government,

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:52.478 align:middle line:84%
OK, but our
military-industrial complex--

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:53.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Cabal.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.146 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it the Cabal.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:58.609 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The Cabal, or--
well, they're not all bad.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.445 align:middle line:84%
Some of these guys, they
now have the ability

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.364 align:middle line:90%
to shoot those tankers down.

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.491 align:middle line:84%
The problem they're
having, George, is

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:08.702 align:middle line:84%
that it's not like a fader dial
where you can kind of fade out

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:09.578 align:middle line:90%
the mind control.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:11.622 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's
either on or it's off.

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And they know this.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.335 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't shot the tankers
down yet, because when they do,

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody goes into
a psychedelic trip.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.298 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they?

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:22.883 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It's unavoidable.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.594 align:middle line:84%
There have already been multiple
experiments-- I've heard this

00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:28.013 align:middle line:84%
from several insiders--
that have been done in which

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.683 align:middle line:84%
they take ordinary folks and
they put them into a room

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:32.059 align:middle line:84%
and they zap them
with the energy

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.435 align:middle line:84%
that our Sun is
going to give off

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.479 align:middle line:90%
when we go through this change.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.399 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual people
become very blissed out.

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They start to get
really telepathic.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.443 align:middle line:84%
They can move things
with their mind.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:42.486 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But the others?

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:43.988 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: People
that are negative,

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:47.616 align:middle line:84%
materialistic, selfish,
fearful-- you start

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.326 align:middle line:90%
to create whatever you think.

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:53.122 align:middle line:84%
So you're manifesting your
own reality in real time.

00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:55.833 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into a panic,
if you go into paranoia,

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start having
terrifying hallucinations.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.379 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
actually see things.

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.131 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
fear them, the more

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:03.632 align:middle line:90%
they're going to appear.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So our government-- I'll say
that-- our government knows

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.015 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to happen if
they take these tankers down.

00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:13.392 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
concerned about it,

00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:90%
because people will freak out.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.521 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
Independence Day.

00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.732 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, very much so.

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.191 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, you're going

00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.067 align:middle line:84%
to have all these
people that are

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.694 align:middle line:90%
having positive experiences.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:25.487 align:middle line:90%
And this is human evolution.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.072 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.907 align:middle line:84%
So if they could
tell us the truth,

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:35.039 align:middle line:84%
and if they could say to
us, OK, this ascension thing

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.124 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen, there
is a consciousness shift

00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
happen, we are going

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.964 align:middle line:84%
to take down a control
system that has stopped you

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:46.634 align:middle line:84%
from having this
consciousness shift,

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:49.511 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to let you
know that we're going to do it,

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has like a week
to prepare, let's say, right?

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.433 align:middle line:84%
And people are going
to be freaking out.

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:59.313 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, get ready,
because once we do this,

00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:01.315 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
some new experiences,

00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:03.776 align:middle line:84%
some new consciousness,
some new abilities.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
just do it all at once.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
We want to tell
you that it's going

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.074 align:middle line:84%
to happen so that you
can be in position

00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:12.493 align:middle line:84%
and understand what's going
to happen to you as this takes

00:24:12.493 --> 00:24:12.826 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:14.328 align:middle line:90%
It is going to be bizarre.

00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:15.954 align:middle line:84%
But once you've
acclimated to it,

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
wonderful new abilities.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.541 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be more psychic.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.418 align:middle line:84%
That's really what they
should be telling us.

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:23.087 align:middle line:84%
In my view, that's
the number one thing.

00:24:23.087 --> 00:24:25.631 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you talking
like the Book of Revelation?

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:29.009 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds
very similar to that.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:32.054 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Nobody knows, George,
exactly what this thing is

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.555 align:middle line:84%
or how this thing
is going to happen.

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:36.809 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who says
that they do is lying.

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:38.143 align:middle line:90%
And that would include me.

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:41.146 align:middle line:84%
I am only presenting
models, hypotheses,

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:44.191 align:middle line:84%
theoretical scenarios
of what may take place.

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.193 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that we absolutely

00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:50.864 align:middle line:84%
know from the insiders is
that these Reptilian folks

00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:54.159 align:middle line:84%
have held us back from what
would already naturally

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:57.162 align:middle line:84%
have been happening over the
course of thousands of years

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:59.832 align:middle line:84%
that would make us able to have
telekinesis, that would make

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.584 align:middle line:84%
things like the Force
that we see in "Star Wars"

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:03.836 align:middle line:90%
an everyday reality.

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:05.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want us to have that.

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: They are
terrified, because if even one

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.263 align:middle line:84%
person starts to really develop
these so-called Jedi abilities,

00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:90%
it's over for them.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over for them.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:84%
David Icke has long said
that there are Reptilians

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.561 align:middle line:90%
in government right now.

00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:23.355 align:middle line:84%
He names a certain few
people and families.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.607 align:middle line:84%
And he's convinced
that that's going on.

00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.609 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I actually had
a feud with David Icke

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.032 align:middle line:84%
many years ago-- this was
the late 1990s-- where

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.534 align:middle line:90%
we kind of had a public debate.

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.494 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't really that
we went head to head

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:90%
on camera or on a radio show.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.542 align:middle line:84%
But what he ultimately did
was he adapted my position.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:47.129 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately a lot of
people don't realize that.

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:50.591 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilian influence that
some seers and psychics have

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:54.052 align:middle line:84%
seen is a telepathic
overlay where

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:56.054 align:middle line:84%
they're looking
at a person's face

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:59.308 align:middle line:84%
and they see-- psychically,
they see a reptilian face

00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:00.934 align:middle line:90%
on that face.

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:04.271 align:middle line:84%
This does not mean that they
are physically shapeshifting.

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.149 align:middle line:84%
So this is where David
Icke's early platform

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:84%
from the mid-90s on into
some of the late 1990s

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.654 align:middle line:90%
has now become its own thing.

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.323 align:middle line:90%
It's a meme.

00:26:14.323 --> 00:26:16.867 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in shapeshifting
biological life forms.

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.243 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:21.079 align:middle line:84%
Biological life is a constant
throughout the universe.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.707 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your DNA is, whatever
your biological structure is,

00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:23.999 align:middle line:90%
that's what you've got.

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
it's going to be.

00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:25.334 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:28.003 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So it's misleading to
think that people in government

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.381 align:middle line:84%
would actually transform
into other types of life.

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:32.174 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen.

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:35.594 align:middle line:84%
But what does happen is
that-- and this is now many,

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.386 align:middle line:90%
many people--

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:37.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a lineage?

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:41.975 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: There are many, many
Reptilians in our solar system.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
as many of them--

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.479 align:middle line:84%
according to some insiders,
there's as many of them

00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:46.688 align:middle line:90%
as there are people on Earth.

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:47.481 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:49.233 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's a
massive population.

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:50.609 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:53.946 align:middle line:84%
That means that, according to
the laws of the universe, when

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.406 align:middle line:84%
someone starts to go in a
negative direction, when they

00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:58.992 align:middle line:84%
start to have negative thoughts,
when they start to behave

00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:01.745 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
self-serving, it's

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:05.249 align:middle line:84%
universal law that a Reptilian
or other similar type

00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:08.001 align:middle line:84%
of negative being can
step in and actually

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:10.963 align:middle line:84%
start to nudge you
like a puppet master

00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:12.339 align:middle line:84%
and get you to
say certain things

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.383 align:middle line:84%
or get you to do certain
things or strengthen you

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:15.467 align:middle line:90%
in one direction.

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
control politicians?

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.264 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It absolutely
appears that they do.

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:21.348 align:middle line:90%
As weird as that sounds--

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:22.474 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just what we need.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.186 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: There's a learning
curve on all this stuff.

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.273 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like trying to
learn Adobe software, right?

00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:30.941 align:middle line:84%
Nobody likes to
learn Adobe software.

00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:31.733 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:34.319 align:middle line:84%
You go through these tutorials,
whether it's Photoshop

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.114 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the software is.

00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:39.491 align:middle line:84%
There's a learning
curve on reality.

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.035 align:middle line:84%
And we have to just
start people on that path

00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.246 align:middle line:84%
so that this doesn't
all hit them at once.

00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:46.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you finding,
David, that people nowadays

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:50.002 align:middle line:84%
are more open to learning
about these things?

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:52.254 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: We got four
generations of disclosure.

00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:55.507 align:middle line:84%
We have four generations
now of deliberately

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.302 align:middle line:84%
planted, government-sponsored
disclosure

00:27:58.302 --> 00:27:59.636 align:middle line:90%
to get us ready for the truth.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:02.431 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we are far more
ready than we were before.

00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.849 align:middle line:84%
And when the truth
hits, it is not

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.267 align:middle line:84%
going to be anywhere
near as jarring

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:06.643 align:middle line:84%
as it would have been,
say, in the 1940s.

00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say,
are we ready for the truth?

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:11.815 align:middle line:90%
Can we "handle the truth"?

00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:14.902 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's still going to
be a very difficult adjustment.

00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:18.572 align:middle line:84%
And shows like what you
and I are doing right now--

00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:20.616 align:middle line:84%
this kind of material that
we're doing right now,

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:23.535 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be the stuff
that everybody goes back to,

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:26.455 align:middle line:84%
just like once Snowden
spoke, all the people

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:29.917 align:middle line:84%
that had been saying
what he said before, now

00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
they become a lot
more interesting.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.544 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:35.464 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So yes, people
will be able to go back--

00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And credible.

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:39.051 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: People will be
able to go back and see, yes,

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.886 align:middle line:84%
that was credible,
like you just said.

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.846 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they were
talking about this.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.682 align:middle line:90%
I didn't pay attention.

00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:90%
But it was there.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right under our noses.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.145 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And
then the people who

00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:53.398 align:middle line:84%
have been paying attention, the
people watching this program,

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:56.526 align:middle line:84%
hearing from all of these
amazing guests and insiders

00:28:56.526 --> 00:29:00.405 align:middle line:84%
that you bring onto this show--
that's part of why we're here.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:04.284 align:middle line:84%
I voted to call Gaia "The
Disclosure Network," OK?

00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:90%
Because we're doing disclosure.

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.704 align:middle line:90%
It's happening week after week.

00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:09.831 align:middle line:84%
We're on the front lines,
bringing out the people--

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:10.374 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:12.209 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --who are
giving us the truth.

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:14.211 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this
war is going to be won.

00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:17.005 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be won
by the people who

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
watch this show and
other shows like this

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:24.888 align:middle line:84%
and who are educated on the
truth being able to intervene

00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:27.808 align:middle line:84%
so that literally they can get
somebody out of bed who doesn't

00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:30.519 align:middle line:84%
want to get out of bed because
they're so overwhelmed by what

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.063 align:middle line:84%
they've heard, to get
them to take a shower,

00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:35.399 align:middle line:84%
to get dressed,
to eat something,

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:37.818 align:middle line:84%
to go to the bathroom,
to do simple things,

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:40.904 align:middle line:84%
because the truth is going
to hurt real bad when

00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:41.738 align:middle line:90%
it comes out.

00:29:41.738 --> 00:29:43.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
amazing, though, is

00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.493 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to continue
to get whistleblowers

00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:49.579 align:middle line:84%
and people to come public with
these kinds of information?

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:50.372 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I know.

00:29:50.372 --> 00:29:51.164 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:52.958 align:middle line:90%
And they're out there.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:58.255 align:middle line:84%
And they are increasingly
disgruntled by the lies

00:29:58.255 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:90%
that they see going on.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.799 align:middle line:90%
They know the truth.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.467 align:middle line:90%
They've worked in the truth.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:07.055 align:middle line:84%
And it's awe-inspiring that
such incredible amounts

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:09.933 align:middle line:84%
of information can
be kept from us.

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That violates people's sense of
basic intellectual stability.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.108 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel stable
when they realize

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:19.359 align:middle line:90%
how much they've been lied to.

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:20.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:23.655 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It actually has
this very traumatizing effect

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:27.993 align:middle line:84%
to realize the scope of the
lie, because it goes back

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to a quote from Hitler where
he says, we tell little lies,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.128 align:middle line:84%
and we let people figure it out,
because they can believe that.

00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.255 align:middle line:84%
But what we also do
is we tell a lie that

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
is so big that nobody
could believe it,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.302 align:middle line:84%
because they could
not live their lives--

00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what's happened.

00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:47.721 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --in
that much of a lie.

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:48.555 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.558 align:middle line:84%
These people can handle
telling that big of a lie.

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:54.478 align:middle line:84%
They actually can go to bed
at night, kiss their kids,

00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:55.937 align:middle line:84%
and then get them
up in the morning

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:90%
and get them ready for school.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.025 align:middle line:84%
They can live that
family domestic life

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:02.444 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they are
part of a group that

00:31:02.444 --> 00:31:04.571 align:middle line:84%
wants to kill billions
of people and that

00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.699 align:middle line:84%
is hiding technology from
us that could literally save

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.992 align:middle line:90%
the planet and everyone on it.

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:11.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David,
through our radio show

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:14.081 align:middle line:84%
and through our Gaia
shows, we are dealing

00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:90%
with millions of people.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.416 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: That's
absolutely true.

00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:17.584 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millions of people.

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:19.544 align:middle line:84%
What one major
thing would you like

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:23.048 align:middle line:84%
them to take away from anything
they've heard us talk about

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:25.467 align:middle line:90%
over the years?

00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.636 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: We are in
a spiritual reality.

00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:32.015 align:middle line:90%
The world is a cosmic classroom.

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:36.853 align:middle line:84%
And its purpose is to teach
us to love one another.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:40.357 align:middle line:84%
If you can absorb
that basic lesson

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and begin applying it to
every aspect of your life,

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.698 align:middle line:84%
you are now authorizing
the positive aspect

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.784 align:middle line:84%
of this spiritual
drama that we're

00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:52.953 align:middle line:90%
talking about to work for you.

00:31:52.953 --> 00:31:56.414 align:middle line:84%
That includes very real,
very powerful, benevolent

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:59.209 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial or
angelic beings that

00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:01.044 align:middle line:84%
will start to give
you synchronicity,

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.547 align:middle line:84%
that will start to create
financial abundance,

00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:07.259 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous prosperity, that
will start to find you the love

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.594 align:middle line:84%
that you want, the people
that you need in your life

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.096 align:middle line:90%
to be happier.

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:14.683 align:middle line:84%
If you create that seed--
you plant the seed,

00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.518 align:middle line:84%
and the universe
will flower it out

00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:22.357 align:middle line:84%
into a much greater gift, a
bounty of joy and happiness

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:23.567 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:26.403 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is, you don't
get to control people.

00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:28.321 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to
be manipulative.

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.448 align:middle line:90%
We are in a glass ceiling.

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:33.034 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we do can
be seen by the bad guys

00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:33.994 align:middle line:90%
and the good guys.

00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:38.081 align:middle line:84%
The bad guys love it, because
if you think that hovering over

00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:40.792 align:middle line:84%
your computer and that you're
off on some little corner

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.295 align:middle line:84%
of the internet-- well, not
only can the NSA watch what

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.338 align:middle line:84%
you're doing on your
computer as you're doing it,

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and they know
everywhere you've been,

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.633 align:middle line:84%
so you can't go to
some dark site--

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:49.301 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't hide.

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.135 align:middle line:90%
You can't hide.

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:50.969 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:53.388 align:middle line:84%
The internet is
one mirror of that,

00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:56.808 align:middle line:84%
and the loss of privacy of the
NSA with cameras in your phones

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:57.851 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:59.519 align:middle line:90%
But there's a deeper level, too.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:02.689 align:middle line:84%
And that deeper level is
that the spiritual community

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:04.149 align:middle line:90%
sees everything in your mind.

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:05.734 align:middle line:84%
Every thought that
you have, they know.

00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.653 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So then it
becomes very clear.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.364 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't you want
to be a loving person?

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:14.159 align:middle line:90%
Is it so hard to be kind?

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:17.579 align:middle line:84%
Is it so hard to want
to help people out,

00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:20.081 align:middle line:84%
to try to have loving
thoughts about them even

00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.541 align:middle line:84%
when they're acting
in a way that's

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.335 align:middle line:90%
very manipulative and negative?

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.836 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
does that stuff,

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.796 align:middle line:84%
when somebody is acting
negatively towards you,

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:30.217 align:middle line:84%
the key is not to return
it with negativity

00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:33.136 align:middle line:84%
but to have healthy
boundaries, to say no,

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:35.722 align:middle line:84%
to not allow yourself
to be walked on,

00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:38.767 align:middle line:84%
but to do it with a respectful,
loving consciousness.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like Gandhi.

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.895 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Gandhi was
able to overthrow--

00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:42.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty darn close.

00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.564 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --the British
empire out of one

00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:46.441 align:middle line:84%
of the largest
countries in the world.

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.568 align:middle line:84%
There's over a billion
people in India now.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.737 align:middle line:84%
And if it hadn't have
been for what he did,

00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:53.031 align:middle line:84%
the Cabal would
totally dominate India.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they got
him, though, eventually.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Well, they did.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.828 align:middle line:84%
But India is now one of the key
countries in this alliance that

00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:00.163 align:middle line:90%
is bringing the Cabal down.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:02.916 align:middle line:84%
And the Cabal does not control
the Indian government at all.

00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:06.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does David
Wilcock believe in God?

00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:11.424 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well,
that question has

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:14.803 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
overtones which-- we

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:17.681 align:middle line:90%
have to get specific now, OK?

00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I believe in God in
so far as I believe

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.478 align:middle line:84%
in a universal
intelligence that created

00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:26.856 align:middle line:84%
the universe, that is the
cosmic consciousness that we

00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:27.399 align:middle line:90%
all share.

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.567 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:32.237 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: If somebody were to
ask me, do you believe in God,

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:35.282 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming out me as
a fundamentalist Christian,

00:34:35.282 --> 00:34:37.784 align:middle line:84%
then my answer to
that question implies

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:41.746 align:middle line:84%
that I have a tacit agreement
with all of their dogma.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:45.041 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that there
is only one son of God.

00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:47.085 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe
that salvation only

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.963 align:middle line:84%
occurs through one
particular religion.

00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
that there is a god.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.802 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
religions are excellent tools

00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:58.847 align:middle line:84%
to help people become
more spiritually evolved

00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:03.351 align:middle line:84%
if you can use that tool
without denouncing others.

00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:06.521 align:middle line:84%
Can you have a
particular faith-- can

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:10.817 align:middle line:84%
you have a faith in Christ or
a faith in Buddha, whatever,

00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:13.445 align:middle line:84%
without saying
that everybody who

00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:15.989 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe the way
that you do is condemned?

00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You remember
the movie "Contact"--

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where Jodie
was with the ET who

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.038 align:middle line:90%
looked like her father.

00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:26.166 align:middle line:84%
Did that so she wouldn't
panic and freak.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.461 align:middle line:84%
But they were all looking,
he said, for the same thing.

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.755 align:middle line:84%
We were all looking--
in the universe--

00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:34.049 align:middle line:90%
for that god-like figure.

00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:36.509 align:middle line:84%
And that's their
quest, that they're

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.845 align:middle line:84%
continuing to look
for life out here,

00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:40.889 align:middle line:90%
but they wanted to find God.

00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think every
extraterrestrial being

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.519 align:middle line:84%
is probably asking
themselves the same question.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.063 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.689 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:51.358 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
those answers yet.

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:53.902 align:middle line:90%
Will we ever get those answers?

00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I think some of
those answers are accessible.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.451 align:middle line:84%
It does appear that benevolent
ETs at a high enough level

00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:04.204 align:middle line:84%
are able to access the
consciousness of the Earth,

00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:07.749 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the Sun,
the consciousness of the galaxy

00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:10.418 align:middle line:84%
as if they were dialing
into an internet.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:14.923 align:middle line:84%
They know what the
agenda is to some degree.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.758 align:middle line:84%
We also hear from
extraterrestrials

00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:19.969 align:middle line:84%
and the most credible sources
that the ultimate nature

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:22.597 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is what they
call intelligent infinity

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.474 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
unfathomable to us.

00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:27.685 align:middle line:84%
There is mystery implicit in
the design of the universe.

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:31.314 align:middle line:84%
So we may be aware that
we are all ultimately one,

00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:34.442 align:middle line:84%
that we're from one
singularity of consciousness,

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.237 align:middle line:84%
and that singularity
gave rise to space

00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:39.614 align:middle line:84%
and time and the
observable universe,

00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:42.075 align:middle line:84%
but that it's not really
there, it's all an illusion,

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing that really
exists is the awareness.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.621 align:middle line:90%
You can know that.

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:50.208 align:middle line:84%
But apparently to
become that awareness

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.919 align:middle line:84%
is to hit what the Tibetans call
"rainbow body," at which point

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:90%
your physical body dissolves.

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:55.964 align:middle line:90%
You've solved the mystery.

00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:58.258 align:middle line:84%
And you return back to
that cosmic consciousness.

00:36:58.258 --> 00:37:01.386 align:middle line:84%
So unless you've actually
ascended that far

00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.179 align:middle line:84%
and hit the full rainbow
body, which is not

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:06.433 align:middle line:84%
what these ETs have done,
then you're still confused,

00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:09.394 align:middle line:84%
and you're still living in
the mystery, in the illusion.

00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:14.441 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we being visited
by ETs from other universes?

00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:16.734 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It does appear
that the answer is yes.

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:19.237 align:middle line:84%
It does appear that
some of the negative ETs

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.656 align:middle line:84%
are being controlled
by an AI and

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:24.325 align:middle line:84%
that the artificial
intelligence or AI does

00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:25.785 align:middle line:84%
have an existence
in what you could

00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:29.038 align:middle line:84%
think of as a separate universe
or a parallel universe.

00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:31.124 align:middle line:84%
It does appear that
there are certainly

00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.252 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
levels of reality,

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:37.672 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a
partition of reality in which

00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:42.051 align:middle line:84%
the atomic vibrational state,
for lack of a better term,

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.428 align:middle line:84%
is out of phase
with us, so there

00:37:43.428 --> 00:37:46.181 align:middle line:84%
could be beings right here
on our set that are actually

00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:48.349 align:middle line:90%
standing right here watching us.

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.059 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
be able to see them.

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.227 align:middle line:90%
We might notice something.

00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Some sense it as--

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Saying, oh, no,
Wilcock said that again?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.442 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I'm
trying to be good.

00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:59.777 align:middle line:84%
They've asked me to not be
so crude in some of things

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:00.612 align:middle line:90%
that I used to say.

00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:02.071 align:middle line:90%
I'd make dick jokes on stage.

00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.074 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to veer
away from that.

00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:07.535 align:middle line:84%
But apparently I'm
not that successful.

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:08.661 align:middle line:90%
So I just did it again.

00:38:11.206 --> 00:38:12.290 align:middle line:90%
They are around.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:90%
We are definitely being visited.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.379 align:middle line:84%
And those parallel universes,
those parallel dimensions--

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.964 align:middle line:90%
they're right here.

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.425 align:middle line:84%
They're interpenetrated with
our own reality completely.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we get the
answers that we all seek?

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.679 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I wouldn't
be doing this

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.598 align:middle line:84%
if I thought we were going to
stay ignorant for another 100

00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.393 align:middle line:84%
I believe that-- and I get
dreams about this all the time.

00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:35.271 align:middle line:84%
I had another one this
morning, very intense.

00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:37.315 align:middle line:84%
The things that you and
I are talking about,

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.317 align:middle line:84%
the things that
we are doing, this

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.653 align:middle line:84%
is going to become
the mainstream.

00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:44.447 align:middle line:84%
People are going to be a
lot more interested in that

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:48.326 align:middle line:84%
than they are in celebrities
who are getting drunk and having

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:51.538 align:middle line:84%
sex and stumbling
around at the Oscars.

00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:54.165 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a very
different type of reality,

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:59.128 align:middle line:84%
because all of a sudden, the
people who have been risking

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:01.422 align:middle line:84%
their lives to bring
forward the truth

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:04.968 align:middle line:84%
will be seen and lauded on
a public level as the heroes

00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:05.802 align:middle line:90%
that they truly are.

00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:06.803 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:08.471 align:middle line:84%
David, thanks for
doing what you do.

00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:09.681 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Thank you, George.

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:11.683 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and paying
this little visit to us.

00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:12.475 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:14.352 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It was good
to stop by here today.

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you got things
a little cleaned up for me.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.981 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:18.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:19.983 align:middle line:90%
They work quickly here.

00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:22.277 align:middle line:84%
