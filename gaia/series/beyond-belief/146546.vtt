00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: In July of
1947, the Army Air Force

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:10%
reported a crash at Roswell,
New Mexico, of what they said

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:10%
was a flying disk.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Then the next day,
that story changed.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And it changed the
lives of a number

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
of people who investigate UFOs.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:90%
One of them, Nick Redfern.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Nick, of course, is a
nationally-known ufologist,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and has been investigating UFOs
for, Nick, how many years now?

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK REDFERN: Probably
30 years, thereabouts.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.612 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get started in this.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, I'm one of
those people who actually

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
hasn't had a UFO encounter.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But my father was in the
British Royal Air Force.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:90%
He worked as a radar mechanic.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the early 1950s, he
was involved in several UFO

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
incidents off the
east coast of England,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
where the radar
personnel were tracking

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:84%
these strange, high-flying
objects performing

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of weird maneuvers.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And fighter planes were
sent up from a nearby base

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:90%
to try to intercept them.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of the pilots
described seeing

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
classic 1950s-style
flying saucers.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Others described seeing
these very bright lights.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And this went on over the
course of three days and nights.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this wave
of encounters was over.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:10%
And my dad, the ground
personnel, the radar operators,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:10%
the radar mechanics, the
pilots, everybody was told,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:10%
you won't talk about this.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And my father didn't mention
it until I was about 11 or 12,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:10%
when he told me the story.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what got
me interested in the subject,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your work, The Roswell
UFO Conspiracy, is dramatic.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And before we get into that,
let's go back a little bit

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to July of 1947, where the
story changed a number of times,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't it?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.579 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: That's right.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
What began in early
July 1947 was a report

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
of the crash and
recovery of a flying

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
disk in Roswell, New Mexico,
actually in Lincoln County,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
on a ranch that was run
by a guy named Mac Brazel.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you think about it,
saying we've recovered a flying

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:10%
disk is pretty sensational.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: It certainly is.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But then, the very next day,
that was actually changed.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It was just a weather balloon.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, guys.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to see.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And that really was the end
of the story until 1993.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in '93
was that the congressman

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico at the
time, Steven Schiff,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
pushed for the Air
Force and the government

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to open its files on
Roswell if any existed.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And what essentially happened
was that the General Accounting

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Office, as it was
known at the time,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:84%
began investigating
the Roswell case

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and asked various
government agencies

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to see if they had any records.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
They came up blank.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
There was literally nothing
at all, apart from one

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
or two scraps of paper.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force decided to
launch its own investigation.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And they concluded
that what came down

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a weather balloon after
all, but a very large Mogul

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:90%
balloon array.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mogul balloons
were used primarily

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.795 align:middle line:84%
to spy on the Soviet Union and
to detect atomic bomb tests.

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: And that
was why the program

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:90%
was considered classified.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a highly
classified program.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Now at that particular
time, the Air Force

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
said we haven't really
touched on the issue

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
of the bodies in this report,
because mogul balloons didn't

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
have crews.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: So that was
the end of that story.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't quite
the end after all.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, the Air Force
released another report saying,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
well, yes there were
actually bodies at Roswell.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:90%
But they weren't human bodies.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:90%
They weren't animals.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
They were crash test dummies
used in high altitude parachute

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.129 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dummies that we
would see, for example,

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:10%
at atomic testing sites,
where they would have

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:10%
the mother, the father, and the
two kids in this wooden house

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:10%
that they blew up.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.401 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to see
what would happen to them.

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: That's
exactly the situation.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was pointed
out to the Air Force

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that the crash test dummy
experiments didn't really

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:90%
begin until the early 1950s.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And the official
response was this

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
was due to time compression.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people were
mistaking 1947 for 1952 or '53.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could that be?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, that's
the big question?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, from
the government itself,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
we have four
answers for Roswell.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
We have the flying disk,
the weather balloon,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the mogul balloon, and
the crash test dummies.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's no wonder
that people, even

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
in the media, the
mainstream media,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.317 align:middle line:90%
wonder what really happened.

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Were confused.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Were surprised.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we have stories
of they took wreckage

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%
to Wright-Patterson.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.702 align:middle line:84%
Why would you do that if it
was just a simple balloon?

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Well that's right.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
that if you just

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
recovered a mogul balloon
or a weather balloon,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
then there really
would be no need

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to take them to
Wright-Patterson,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
which was the headquarters
of the Foreign Technology

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Division.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Foreign Technology
Division essentially

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
looked at foreign technology.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.009 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: The Russians.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And today, the Chinese
and North Koreans.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we got our hands
on a missile or a bit of a space

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
satellite, we would
be able to analyze it.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words, whatever
came down at Roswell,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
domestic, extraterrestrial,
then Wright-Patterson

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
would have been the ideal
place to take it to.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your new book, "The
Roswell UFO Conspiracy,"

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
deals with something
very similar,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
but has a dramatic twist to it.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Well, yeah.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a
number of theories,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as I said, in
relation to what did

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:90%
or didn't happen at Roswell.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
One particular story that
I've been investigating

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
since the early 2000s suggests
a theory that, in many ways,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
is more dark and more
dangerous and more

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
controversial, sinister, than
the idea that aliens crashed.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And it focuses on the idea
of human experimentation.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, human guinea pigs
used in high altitude flights

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
over New Mexico that encompassed
gigantic balloon arrays

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:90%
and lifting body-type aircraft.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, it
was part and parcel

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:10%
of a program to determine how
the human body would react

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:10%
to high altitude exposure.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was something that was
fairly not that well-known back

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
in the 1940s.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
experiments were

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
done on chimpanzees, on
monkeys, rats, mice, even pigs.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But the story that I started
to uncover in the early 2000s

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
suggested this far more
controversial angle

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of using human test
subjects, and in many cases

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.779 align:middle line:90%
against their will.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
there were actually

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
a number of these
experiments undertaken

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
in '47 throughout New Mexico
that, according to the people

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to, suggested that these
accounts of these incidents

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that went wrong and crashed
were responsible for the legends

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.054 align:middle line:84%
of dead aliens and
crashed flying saucers.

00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, who were
the subjects that were

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.799 align:middle line:90%
used in these balloon tests?

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, to answer
that question, George,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:84%
we really have to go back to
the end of the Second World War.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.771 align:middle line:84%
We assumed, quite
correctly, that the Russians

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.895 align:middle line:84%
were going to be the next
big problem, potentially.

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:53.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, they were.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, that's right.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
that, when the war ended,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
we grabbed a lot of
the German scientists

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and brought them over
to the US under what's

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.324 align:middle line:90%
called Operation Paperclip.

00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: And
essentially, you had

00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Nazi scientists brought
over working on V-2 rockets,

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot more
sophisticated rockets as well.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wernher von
Braun being one of them.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Exactly.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who, without
him, we may have never

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
had the space program
that we ended up having.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: That's right.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, there
was a lesser-known Japanese

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
counterpart to Operation
Paperclip where,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Second
World War, the Japanese,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
had Hiroshima and
Nagasaki not happened,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
they were planning on building
these vast balloons that

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:90%
would fly across the Pacific.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.085 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, sort of
a kamikaze mission.

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They would actually
be crewed balloons.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
would crash them?

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yes, they
would direct them

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:90%
into cities, things like that.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Now, there
was a precedent for this.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:10%
During in the Second
World War, the Japanese

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:10%
had these balloons
called Fu-Go balloons.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.772 align:middle line:84%
And they were essentially
balloon bombs.

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have crews.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They were very small.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But they were calibrated to
travel across the Pacific,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and they would get lower and
lower as they reached the US.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And these bombs would explode.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, there was
only one case where there were

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:90%
casualties and the people died.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.502 align:middle line:84%
For the most, part the
bombs didn't explode.

00:09:19.502 --> 00:09:21.335 align:middle line:84%
Or if they did, it was
in a remote location.

00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Japanese
did have an experimental unit

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.502 align:middle line:90%
during World War II, Nick.

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Unit 731 was a covert
biological and chemical warfare

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
research and development unit
of the Japanese military that

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
engaged in lethal
human experimentation.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Established in 1935,
it served as the center

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
of Japan's biological warfare
in China and Southeast Asia

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The museum was once the main
building used by Unit 731,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
located in the Pingfang
district of suburban Harbin.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
In August 1945, when
the Soviet Union

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:84%
entered Northeast
China and freed Harbin,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the unit had to abandon
their facilities in haste.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The retreating
Japanese troops blew up

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.489 align:middle line:84%
the compound to destroy
evidence of their activities.

00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Nick, did this
experimental unit have anything

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:90%
to do with your theory.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, it
actually does, George.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
In conjunction with
these balloon testings

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and these radical new balloons
that were being developed,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
one of the ideas
that the Japanese had

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
was to load these huge balloons
with biological warfare

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
agents, which would be
even worse than sort

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
of kamikaze missions.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
If, God forbid,
you had some sort

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of biological agent released
across the United States.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, that
didn't happen, obviously.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But what did happen
was that, as well as

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
getting all the technology
over to the United States

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
from Japan in relation
to these balloons,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the files
and records, and some

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists and personnel
that were working for Unit 731,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
were also all brought
over to the United States.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the records
have been declassified,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and you can read them at the
National Archives in Maryland.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of pages
on the Japanese program

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:90%
and the material brought over.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, how long
would it take a balloon

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to float from Japan to the West
Coast of the United States?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Oh, it would
actually take quite a while.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Days?

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Weeks?

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:90%
We're talking days, yeah.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:10%
But one of the
interesting things

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:10%
is that, certainly with the
balloon bombs in the Second

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:10%
World War, it's more like a
psychological weapon than one

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:10%
that actually could cause
a great amount of danger

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:10%
or damage.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, these
bigger balloons,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
that was a different story.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know for sure that the
plans that the Japanese had

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:90%
for these big balloons were--

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.946 align:middle line:84%
The records were found in Japan,
were brought over so we could,

00:11:50.946 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
in the same way we're working
with the German scientists,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
we could increase our
technology by looking

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
at these Japanese
balloons as well.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And the story that
I was given was

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:84%
that a number of
these large balloons

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
were tested over New Mexico
with these lifting body-type

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
aircraft beneath them,
which could be detached.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And in a war situation, that
would be the kamikaze weapon.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Or it would you be
able to drop bombs.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: But in terms of the
Roswell case, what I was told

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:84%
was that there was some
sort of mid-air accident.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And the craft detached
from the balloon array.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The balloon exploded,
and the balloon wreckage,

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or the debris, showered
down on the ranch,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
almost like a huge
snowfall, so to speak.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But then, the craft
itself, being much heavier,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
just plummeted down vertically.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So we had two different
crash sites on the ranch.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:90%
One where the craft came down.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you had this
huge field of debris.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there were several
crash sites, were there not?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.656 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, that's
the interesting thing.

00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just one
location on the ranch.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We know for sure that
the debris area that

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
was found by the rancher Mac
Brazel, where there was all

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
this strange foil strewn
about the ranch itself,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:90%
that was the primary site.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But there were rumors that,
as Brazel was searching

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
around the ranch to
try and figure out

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:84%
what was happening, that he
found another site where there

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.374 align:middle line:90%
were several bodies.

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether you take
the view that they

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
were Japanese or alien,
pretty much everybody

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that has looked
into this case has

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
suggested those was this second
site where a number of bodies

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:84%
were found, partly decayed due
to the rigors of the weather

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:90%
in the summer in New Mexico.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
potentially a third site

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
where the craft came down,
whether intact or partially

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:90%
damaged.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there are at least two
sites, potentially three sites.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a ufologist.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.679 align:middle line:90%
You investigate UFO stories.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.595 align:middle line:90%
You're not a debunker.

00:13:54.595 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: No.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not a skeptic.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
You just want to
get to the truth.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most
ufologists, when they

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
hear this theory of the
balloons and small Japanese

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
coming over and testing this,
would probably say, "No.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:90%
This was a UFO.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
We want it to be a UFO crash."

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a hunger
in the field of ufology

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to make this case,
Roswell, New Mexico,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.056 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial case.

00:14:23.056 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, there's
no doubt about that.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are some
researches, like Stan Friedman,

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Stan legitimately concludes that
aliens did crash at Roswell.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
researchers who

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
I think are more belief-driven.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That kind of X-Files "I
want to believe" factor.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: And I think
what has happened

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
over the years is that
Roswell has been elevated

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:90%
to ufology's sacred cow.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
It's the number one case--

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is that.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: --in ufology.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you
blow that bubble,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
you may blow the
bubble on everything.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well,
that's the thing.

00:14:56.716 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
always dangerous

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
if you elevate something
to the number one events.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Because it's like the old adage.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The larger they are,
the harder they fall.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
Roswell was proved

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to not have been
extraterrestrial,

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:84%
but to have been something
more controversial,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
but down-to-earth,
I think it would

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
create a lot of
disillusionment in ufology.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
People would feel, is it
worth keep investigating--

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any of them.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: --if the best case
is not the best case after all?

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But from my perspective, you're
right, I'm not a debunker.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that,
beginning in 2001,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I got these stories from
a number of old-timers

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
in the military, the
intelligence community, etc,

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%
who told me the story.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the only one that's

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.444 align:middle line:84%
viable, that makes common
sense, if it wasn't aliens.

00:15:54.444 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and see,
what has always bothered me,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Nick, over the years, as I've
looked at the Roswell case,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that if it was
an extraterrestrial craft that

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
probably came from, let's say,
a mother ship hovering around

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
our planet, the
point is it crashed.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And how could
something that traveled

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
so many millions of miles
to get to our planet

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
then simply crash?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And I am I always had
a difficult time trying

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.854 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:16:22.854 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Well, yeah.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.936 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a good point.

00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And on that same
track, George, if you

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:84%
look at some of the
genuinely weird UFO cases,

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
we have accounts of aliens
kidnapping aircraft, kidnapping

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:90%
pilots, walking through walls.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Which makes me wonder,
why didn't they

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
just collect the wreckage?

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And then nobody would
have known about it.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And go.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: And go.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I can clearly kidnap
planes in the sky and pilots,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:84%
then why not actually
just hover over the ranch,

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
collect the materials,
or just obliterate it?

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And then nobody would
be any the wiser at all.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was another
Japanese operation during World

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.525 align:middle line:90%
War II called Project Fu-Go.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Supposedly, the whole
city of Denver saw it.

00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knew what
they were seeing.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The balloon bomb attack
against North America was

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:90%
a real threat.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> People didn't
know what it was.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.840 align:middle line:90%
A very strange device

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was actually happening.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a matter of what
is the magnitude that this

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:90%
is going to develop into.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a clampdown
of release of information.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The media needed
to be subdued.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Papers did sit on the
biggest stories that happened

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:90%
in their region.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:90%
"Do not talk about this."

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
They did not want any news
going back to the Japanese.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> A unique Japanese offensive
weapon of an unknown magnitude

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.745 align:middle line:90%
was lifting into the skies.

00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It was quite a feat to
make such a mechanical device.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Understanding the complex
jet streams would be the key

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.085 align:middle line:84%
to Japan's balloon
bomb offensive.

00:17:58.085 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to
tell you, Nick.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
That there is an
incredible story.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.414 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And how many
balloons do you think

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
they would have launched
at us at any given time?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well reportedly,
they launched thousands.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But not all of them
reached the United States.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was a really
inventive weapon.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was a dangerous weapon.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because on a number
of occasions,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
people found these things
and wondered what they were,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:90%
this strange balloon debris.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So others landed
in the United States?

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REDFERN: Yes, there was
actually, fortunately,

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.087 align:middle line:10%
just one case of fatalities.

00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a family
that was picnicking

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and they came across
this wreckage.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.004 align:middle line:84%
And the bomb was still
primed and several of them

00:18:36.004 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:90%
had been killed.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It blew up on them?

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.866 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: It blew up
on them and killed them.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But that was the only example
of where deaths occurred.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But well into the 1960s,
in sort of remote forests,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:90%
people were still finding them.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of tells
a fascinating story

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of these not
highly-advanced balloons,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:84%
but the way they were calibrated
to travel across the jet stream

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:90%
from Japan to the United States.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And it would get lower
and lower in the sky,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and calibrated to
come down over the US.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, in
one sense, they

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
were like a
psychological weapon.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Propaganda designed
to frighten people.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that the Japanese
had developed these balloons

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and were going on to develop
these even more larger

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and sophisticated
ones, which would have

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
these aircraft attached beneath
them, that could be detached

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and used like a kamikaze
device or to bomb cities,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:84%
we realized that, well, we
could use this technology

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective as well.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps to launch aircraft
high into the sky,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and then have them detach.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And it really was an example
of using this technology

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
as a means to not
so much develop

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
the start of the space program,
but the pre-space program,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did every balloon
have Japanese occupants?

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: No.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
gets controversial.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And there is some
support for this.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The stories that I was told
was that, in some cases,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
the people were Japanese.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was a case of they
were brought over from Japan.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was the kind of
offer you can't refuse.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.956 align:middle line:90%
You work for us--

00:20:16.956 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a one
way trip though, right?

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Well, no.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
It actually wasn't meant
to be a one-way trip, no.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they get back?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, if they
had a lifting craft, then

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:84%
they could actually
glide that back down

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
to where the craft
took off from.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just drop it
and go back up again?

00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Well, yes.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But, no, it would
have to be reattached.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It was just, each one
would be a one-time event.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But in some of the cases, it was
reportedly the Japanese crews.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, in some of these
other experiments,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
where there were just
high-altitude balloons,

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and testing and understanding
high altitude exposure,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the story I got
was they actually

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.169 align:middle line:84%
took a number of
people, like prisoners.

00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:57.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Japanese prisoners?

00:20:57.335 --> 00:20:58.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: No.

00:20:58.135 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:90%
American prisoners.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And gave them deals
in the United States.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
If you take part in
these experiments,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
we will knock three
years off your sentence,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, those files
have surfaced in relation

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
to what was called a
nuclear aircraft program.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
in the late '40s,

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
there were plans to build
nuclear-powered aircraft.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And the declassified files
through the Freedom Information

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Act actually do
talk about the idea

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
of approaching prisons and
seeing if prisoners wanted

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
a shorter sentence, but
you've got to take part

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:90%
in this experiment.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, it gets really
controversial,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
because some of the
people reportedly used

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
as guinea pigs in these
high-altitude balloon flights

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
were people taken
from, like, asylums.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Basically, handicapped people.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
wanted bodies up there.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:84%
They wanted people
who were alive.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Who could be brought
back, hopefully alive.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And we would be able to
determine how they physically

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
had been affected,
or not affected,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
by high-altitude exposure by
cosmic rays, by radiation.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
true, that may well

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
explain why there was so
much secrecy and so much

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of a cover up to hide the fact
that human guinea pigs may

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:90%
have actually been used.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:90%
The craft came down, crashed.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
The bodies of the people
were strewn around and--

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They looked alien.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yep.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the other thing.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:84%
That some of the
people were reportedly

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
physically handicapped.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And they change chose
physically handicapped people

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:90%
because that's what they wanted.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was easy to get people
who wouldn't be missed,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
who were in asylums.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they didn't have
family, or something like that.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, because
back then, in the '40s,

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
there was certainly more
stigma about physical handicaps

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:90%
and psychological handicaps.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, the
Japanese theory,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:90%
the timeline doesn't make sense.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Because the war ended in 1945.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Roswell occurred in 1947.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have taken
two years for that balloon

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:90%
to come over here.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
that time gap?

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Oh, well,
what it actually

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
was, when the war
ended and we brought

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
all the files and the personnel
and the balloon data, etc,

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and the Unit 731 people, we
brought all that over in '45.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was being
secretly research,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and these balloons are being
constructed within the United

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
States over the
course of '45, '46.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And the testing reportedly
began in early '47.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like a secret
unit of the Japanese

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that was still fighting
the war in '47.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It was like with the
Paperclip program.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That in the same way that
the rockets were brought over

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists
were brought over

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.170 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, the Japanese
scientists and technology

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:90%
were brought over from Japan.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So it was a case of--

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying that
the balloon that was launched

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:90%
did not come from Japan?

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: No, it was
based on Japanese designs

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:90%
but constructed in the U.S.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.181 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha!

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a big difference.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was it
kept secret for so long?

00:24:12.832 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, in the
same way that Paperclip

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:90%
was hidden for so long.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.035 align:middle line:90%
That "loose lips sink ships."

00:24:19.035 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
It was essentially a case of
burying these programs, not

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
so much because
of the technology,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
but because it revolved
around doing deals with people

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:84%
who we'd just been fighting
for the last close to a decade

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:90%
almost.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.219 align:middle line:84%
And so, in other words,
it wasn't so much

00:24:39.219 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that there was anything
particularly secret

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.182 align:middle line:90%
about the balloons.

00:24:42.182 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything
particularly secret

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%
about the German rockets.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The secret was we did deals
with the Nazi scientists

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and we did deals with
the Unit 731 people.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.897 align:middle line:84%
Those were the big secrets
that had to be hidden.

00:24:54.897 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
We have a little video clip of
the 1947 episode in Roswell.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.111 align:middle line:84%
It's a great
incident, of course.

00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:90%
[MORSE CODE BEEPING]

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Headline edition,
July 8th, 1947.

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The Army Air Force has
announced that a flying

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
disk has been found, and is now
in the possession of the Army.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:10%
Army officers say the missile,
found some time last week,

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:10%
has been inspected at
Roswell, New Mexico,

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.305 align:middle line:10%
and sent to Wright Field in
Ohio for further inspection.

00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
actually broadcast

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.055 align:middle line:84%
by the newscaster who was
given that information

00:25:29.055 --> 00:25:29.855 align:middle line:90%
by the military.

00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:30.854 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: That's right.

00:25:30.854 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then the next
day, they recanted that story.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.154 align:middle line:10%
>>REDFERN: Mm-hm
Well, you know, that's

00:25:35.154 --> 00:25:38.829 align:middle line:10%
an interesting you know piece
of audio, the main reason being,

00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:10%
because you're quite
right, that they

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:10%
announced it was a flying disk.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:10%
And I asked the people
I interviewed, well,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:10%
how do you reconcile that?

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
If the military knew
that it was really

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
a secret device
of theirs, why say

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:90%
it was a flying disk at all?

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And the answer I got
was that the guys who

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
flew the device and
the guys at Roswell

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.695 align:middle line:90%
were two distinct entities.

00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not one wasn't knowing
what the other was doing?

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
I interviewed said

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that the vast majority
of these balloon launches

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:84%
were initiated from White
Sands, from what is today

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:90%
the White Sands Missile Range.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Not too far from Roswell.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Not too far, no.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And some from Alamogordo.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But the programs were so
tightly hidden that need to know

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:90%
was the order of the day.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the guys
working at Roswell

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything
about this program.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So when the rancher Mac
Brazel found this wreckage,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.699 align:middle line:84%
and it was reportedly
a night flight.

00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
had night flights

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.156 align:middle line:84%
was because these vast
balloons, in the summer,

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
they were so large
and they would

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
get so high that
they could explode

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:90%
because of the daytime heat.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So they would have
nighttime flights.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They weren't anticipating this
thing exploding and crashing,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:90%
which is what happened.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And so with it being
a nighttime flight,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
they weren't sure
where it had come down.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you had the
rancher, in a worst case

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
scenario for the military,
getting there before they did.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Then the rancher tells
the local police.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
He contacts the guys at Roswell.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:90%
They come out.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
anything about it.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Then they announce,
well, could it

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:84%
be one of those flying saucers
everybody's talking about?

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Then the guys that launched it
from the other installations,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
they're like, oh, no.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:90%
They've just found--

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.978 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They found it.

00:27:28.978 --> 00:27:32.066 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: What we've just been
looking for the last 24 hours.

00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And the cat's got
out of the bag.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Because one group has
released the information,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
not knowing it's actually
a domestic program

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:90%
of another arm of the military.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, if they only
have social networking,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
they would have known
everything instantly.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And that does happen.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Agency A doesn't know
what Agency B is doing.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And it really was just
due to those circumstances

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of the unpredictability
and the unforeseen issue

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of the balloon exploding,
and the craft coming down

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and the balloon
debris coming down,

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
with it being a
nighttime flight, which

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
made it more difficult for
them to find the wreckage.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, a
30-foot type size craft

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and just a field
of balloon debris

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
would be fairly hard
to find at night.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you've got
the other unforeseen angle

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.335 align:middle line:84%
of the rancher getting there
before the military found it.

00:28:28.335 --> 00:28:29.135 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:29.135 --> 00:28:30.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Puzzled and baffled.

00:28:30.715 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Quickly contacting
the police, who

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
quickly contact the guys at
Roswell, who quickly come out

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.707 align:middle line:90%
to the scene.

00:28:37.707 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're there
before anybody else.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that
Major Jesse Marcel

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
went to the debris
field, which could well

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
have been this huge
field of balloon debris.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: But two other
guys, Sheridan Cavitt

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and Bill Rickett, who we
also know were on the ranch,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, who were
also based at Roswell,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:84%
there's good evidence
that they actually

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:90%
stumbled on the body site.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Or Brazel took them
to the body site,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
where Marcel went back to
the base with the wreckage.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The late Jesse Marcel,
Jr., the son of Jesse Marcel,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:10%
who was a military doctor
in Iraq, and I've known him,

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.740 align:middle line:10%
you knew him, said that
his father showed him

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:10%
something from
the wreckage which

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:10%
looked like Egyptian
hieroglyphs,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:10%
or something like that.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:10%
Might they have been Japanese?

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REDFERN: Well, that's
actually what I was told.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:10%
That because they brought
the Japanese personnel,

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:10%
the scientists, and
even the crews that

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:10%
would build these balloons,
and show them the designs

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:10%
that they got, it was kind of
like in the Second World War

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:10%
when we would bomb Germany.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:10%
The guys in the crews, on
the aircraft and the bombers,

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:10%
they would sometimes
write little messages

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:10%
and say "Hey,
Adolf" on the bombs.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.127 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of a morale
increasing thing.

00:30:05.127 --> 00:30:06.585 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
drop the bombs.

00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we knew
what our troops used to do,

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
painting their planes
with all kinds of things.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Exactly.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.535 align:middle line:84%
I was told it was
something akin to that.

00:30:15.535 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
That they would leave
their trademark messages

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:90%
on these balloons.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We weren't at war then, but
they put their names on there.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they may just put a
message, something like that.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that it was
Japanese writing, which

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.232 align:middle line:84%
maybe a lot of people in
the 1940s would not know.

00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I did not
know about your theory

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.209 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was interviewing
Jesse Marcel, Jr.,

00:30:39.209 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:90%
or I would have asked him that.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:84%
If it was possible that
what he saw was Japanese.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Because if you look
at Japanese writing,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:10%
it would look like something
very out of this world.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, so that's--

00:30:52.575 --> 00:30:53.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That makes sense.

00:30:53.775 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: It does.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And what convinces
me that this could

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.426 align:middle line:84%
be the answer is that if it was
just fed to me and to nobody

00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:84%
else, then I would
have been suspicious

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that, well, there's only one
person being given this story.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.329 align:middle line:84%
But if we look into it, the
late Leonard Stringfield,

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.245 align:middle line:90%
a UFO researcher who--

00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:14.111 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A good one.

00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, he was.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And he extensively investigated
crashed UFO stories.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
He was actually given the
Japanese angle in 1990,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and briefly published
it in a report in 1991,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:84%
where he was told that a lot
of these Japanese people,

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
some of them handicapped,
were brought over and taken

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
to Los Alamos, where
investigations and tests were

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:90%
done on them.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Different ones, though, but in
relation to radiation exposure.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, Los Alamos
is in New Mexico as well.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, Stringfield
published that in '91.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, the well-respected
magazine Popular Mechanics,

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:84%
they published an article
saying they'd actually

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
been told of a forthcoming
release of files, which

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
would tell of a Japanese
equivalence of Paperclip,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and that the files
were going surface.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, the files didn't surface.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:84%
What did surface in '97 instead
was the crash test dummy angle.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But Popular Mechanics
did go on the record

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
as stating that
someone on the inside

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
had said this is
going to come out.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2004, a
well-respected Australian

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.290 align:middle line:84%
researcher, Keith
Baskerfield, Keith

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
was given the same story,
almost identical to that

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:90%
which I'd been given.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But I hadn't published
anything on them.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was almost
literally identical,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
even down to the nighttime
flight and the rancher

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.530 align:middle line:84%
getting the story out
before the military

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:90%
was able to get there first.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when you put all
those different strands

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:49.200 align:middle line:84%
from around the world together,
that is, for me at least,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
a pointer that I'm in
the right direction.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, most of
the people associated

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.290 align:middle line:84%
with the original Roswell
episode in 1947 are dead.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.381 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The mortician is dead.

00:33:01.381 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Eyewitnesses are dead.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.392 align:middle line:90%
Pilots are dead.

00:33:05.392 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Are we ever going to get
to the bottom of this?

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, that's
the big question.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the big
irony, of course,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is that, in all the theories
that have been put forward,

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.080 align:middle line:84%
one of them probably is,
we do have the answer.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: So the big problem
is we can't prove the answer.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And testimony's great.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Documentation.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.550 align:middle line:84%
To a degree that we've
got it, is great.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of it is just,
like, the MJ-12 documents,

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:10%
which people have questions
because they're leaked,

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:10%
rather than
officially-released documents.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So the big problem
is, how do we get

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:84%
past this stumbling
block of we've

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:84%
got this, we've
got the testimony,

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:90%
but where do we now take it?

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
There are two or
three possibilities.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Either the government
comes clean

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
or an agency comes
clean because it

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
wants that data to get
out, versus somebody else

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't want it to get out.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.975 align:middle line:84%
I think there
could have actually

00:33:58.975 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
been a silent battle
behind the scenes

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
whether or not they
should be released.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, another theory,
which isn't impossible,

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
given that we're all flawed, it
could it surface by accident.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
That something gets declassified
or released by mistake.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:84%
And it could just be a
paragraph in a totally otherwise

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
innocuous document, but
references something that

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:84%
And then, just by
the circumstances,

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
it provokes further
doors to open.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there been
any government documents

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that have been released
by whistleblowers

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or by the Freedom of
Information Act that

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:84%
would point that something very
unusual happened at Roswell.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: There
actually is one, really.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's become known
as the Ramey Memo.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened in '47, after
Jesse Marcel found the debris,

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
he was flown up to Fort Worth.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
famous situation,

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:84%
or infamous situation, where
you had the press there taking

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:90%
photographs.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
remember that picture

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:84%
of him kneeling down
with all this stuff

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:90%
put all over the place.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.989 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: That's right.

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people who was
there was General Roger Ramey.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Ramey actually had a piece
of paper in his hand.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And with today's
technology, we've

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
been able to blow it up and
try and decipher and deblur

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:90%
what it actually says.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And it actually does look in
one part as if it refers to,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
quote, "the victims
of the wreck."

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.907 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then we're

00:35:34.907 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
clearly not talking
about a weather balloon.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.835 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about a Mogul balloon.

00:35:38.835 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And nobody of a
sound mind is going

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to call a crash
test dummy a victim.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So that is a pointer either
towards human casualties

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:90%
or alien casualties.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
My view is that,
if it was aliens,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I think they would
have used terms

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.194 align:middle line:84%
like "the aliens,"
"the spacemen".

00:35:58.194 --> 00:35:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The occupants

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.151 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: The occupants.

00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
To me, "victims"
sounds more of an--

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.451 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: --emotional,
human angle to it.

00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:84%
That's about the only
thing that surfaced.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The other theory that
some people have suggested

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is that, one day, there
might be something

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
like a ufological
Edward Snowden.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would hope so.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: The problem
is that whatever

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
happened is buried so deeply,
literally perhaps so deeply

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in an underground bunker,
which is guarded 24/7,

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:90%
there's just no way to get it.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So we are at that stage where
it's becoming like a UFO

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.730 align:middle line:90%
equivalent of Jack the Ripper.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
An old mystery which
everybody knows about.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Different theories.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Lots of witnesses back then.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.400 align:middle line:90%
But now they're all gone.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Where do we take it from here?

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we just need to
keep digging and digging--

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: --and digging.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all you can do.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
Roswell, New Mexico

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is right in the middle
of military bases

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.646 align:middle line:90%
and applications.

00:37:01.646 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It began in
Roswell, New Mexico.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Near White Sands and
Alamogordo, Roswell

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
was home base for many
early tests of atom bombs

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:90%
and guided missiles.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Here also, the practice
of military stonewalling

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
may have been perpetrated.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know, Nick.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The romantic part
of me would love

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.309 align:middle line:84%
to think that this
was a crashed UFO.

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well,
ironically, so would

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I. Because it would
legitimize everything

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.890 align:middle line:90%
we've ever said and done.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But I have to be
honest with myself

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and honest with my
readers or listeners.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: But I put this
story out not to debunk

00:37:40.775 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
or not to destroy belief
systems or cause ufology

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%
to come crashing down.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I put the story
out because I think

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:56.410 align:middle line:84%
it is a legitimately common
sense-filled explanation

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:90%
for a very controversial event.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
only one that is valid,

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.580 align:middle line:90%
if the ufological one is not.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But I feel the responsibility's
on my part to put this out,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.080 align:middle line:84%
because I think it does
answer a lot of the questions

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:90%
as to what happened.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we saw how packed
in the 1940s were--

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico was in the 1940s.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.555 align:middle line:84%
We had Los Alamos, where the
atomic bomb was developed,

00:38:26.555 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:90%
or a lot of the research.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We had White Sands, where a
lot of the Paperclip scientists

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:90%
were based.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Alamogordo, where, again, a
lot of the German scientists.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one of
the more intriguing ones,

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that the Roswell Army
Air Force Base itself

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:90%
was home to the 509th Wing.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The 509th were the guys who
dropped the atomic bombs

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:90%
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So you had multiple
installations and facilities

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, which were really
at the forefront of military

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.450 align:middle line:90%
and government secrecy.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
on the ranch, you

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
have this weird
contraption come down.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, we are at the
70th anniversary of the Roswell

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:90%
crash.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:90%
70 years.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And still, we don't have
the definitive answer.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.445 align:middle line:90%
Do you think we ever will?

00:39:18.445 --> 00:39:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well,
I try and remain

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:84%
optimistic in every
aspect of life.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But certainly Roswell, I am
optimistic that the answers

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:90%
will surface.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.065 align:middle line:84%
I think the worst
thing we can do

00:39:29.065 --> 00:39:31.660 align:middle line:90%
is say, well, it's 70 years ago.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.374 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's dead.

00:39:33.374 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:90%
We've got as much as we can.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would be a weak
and defeatist approach to take.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.045 align:middle line:84%
I think we just need
to keep pushing,

00:39:43.045 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:84%
look down the alternative
pathways for what happened,

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:84%
keep pushing through
Freedom of Information.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.970 align:middle line:84%
If we keep putting the word
out, maybe there's some 70,

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:84%
80-year-old guy who
was involved back

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.180 align:middle line:84%
then, who happened to take
40 or 50 pages with him

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:90%
when he retired.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And when security may not
have been so stringent,

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:90%
where everything wasn't online.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.330 align:middle line:90%
But you had actual paper files.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.527 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something one
day, if we keep pushing,

00:40:15.527 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:90%
is going to surface.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:90%
I hope that happens.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I'll just keep
on trying to get the answers.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would Nick
Redfern, perhaps,

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.520 align:middle line:90%
want it to be a crashed UFO?

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yes.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the
biggest irony of all,

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective,
of what I'm doing.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I would love it if proof
surfaced that extraterrestrials

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.390 align:middle line:90%
crashed at Roswell.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's proof
that there is life

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the universe.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be a defining
moment in human history.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would be happy to admit,
but I would freely admit--

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: --that I
was fed disinformation

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to hide the UFO angle.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
threads and so many leads.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And the timeframe and the
scientists being brought over

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.925 align:middle line:84%
and the descriptions
of the bodies looking--

00:41:03.925 --> 00:41:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes
too much sense.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: --Japanese
and, quote,

00:41:06.755 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
"Oriental," as they
worded it back then.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
For me, I don't think
I'm on the wrong track.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm on the right track.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.620 align:middle line:90%
But the next step is like--

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
With Stan, for example,
investigating the UFO angle,

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:84%
both Stan and I are
looking for the same thing.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the undeniable
proof of what happened.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
this tell you, though?

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if the
mother of UFO cases

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be earthbound,
right, this theory of

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.470 align:middle line:90%
balloons and tests.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But if it turns out to
be that's the case, what

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
does that tell you about the
field of ufology in general

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
if the biggest case turns
out to be earthbound?

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, if it turns
out not to be so big after all,

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
cause us to look at ufology

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, if Roswell,
the best crashed UFO case,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.430 align:middle line:84%
crumbles, then by default,
that's going to make us think,

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.610 align:middle line:84%
well, are any of the other
crashed UFO stories real?

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Or were they something
else like Kecksburg

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.377 align:middle line:90%
or Aztec, could they have been--

00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rendlesham.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.376 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, Rendlesham.

00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Could they have
been secret devices?

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Also, if there were no crashed
UFOs and no dead aliens

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from Roswell, does that mean
that all these other stories

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:84%
about dead aliens stored away in
cryogenic storage underground,

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:90%
are they all false?

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes wonder,
if that happens,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:84%
if ufology may move away from
sort of a definitive alien

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:84%
nuts-and-bolts approach,
and perhaps go down the more

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.730 align:middle line:84%
paranormal path that people like
John Keel and Jacques Vallée

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:48.615 align:middle line:90%
have spoken about.

00:42:48.615 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dimensional
and things like that.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Dimensional, yeah.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to think of
it, though, as planetary.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:84%
That, in this vastness
of our universe

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that's beyond the
multiverses, there

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
are other planets,
hundreds and thousands

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of other planets
with human beings,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
with occupants,
with inhabitants.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to believe that.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to believe that
we're alone in the universe.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: I totally
agree with you.

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And I cannot deny that.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe, still, there's
a genuine UFO phenomenon.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we mentioned earlier,
my father's experience.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:84%
The maneuvers and
the performances

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that were going on in
the skies over England

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
then when he was
working on radar, nobody

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.157 align:middle line:84%
was flying anything
like that back then.

00:43:34.157 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
a really good case

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
from the '50s, the
'60s, the '70s.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my goodness, yeah.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.890 align:middle line:84%
There are too many
great cases out there.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:40.815 align:middle line:90%
The Lonnie Zamora.

00:43:40.815 --> 00:43:41.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yep.

00:43:41.615 --> 00:43:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Socorro
New Mexico police

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
officer who saw a craft
land, saw occupants.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.450 align:middle line:84%
They got in and
went back up again.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Yeah.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective,
I'm a full-on believer

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO phenomenon.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not convinced that
an aspect to that phenomenon

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:58.995 align:middle line:90%
came down at Roswell.

00:43:58.995 --> 00:44:00.494 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
think back to when

00:44:00.494 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I was a 21-year-old radio
reporter in Detroit, Michigan,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Nick.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had the opportunity
to interview Dr. Benjamin

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Simon, who was the
psychiatrist of Barney

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and Betty Hill, the first
major UFO abduction case, that

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.920 align:middle line:90%
was released in the '60s.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Look Magazine did
a huge story on it.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.400 align:middle line:84%
John Fuller wrote a book
about The Interrupted Journey.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.910 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing case.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed Simon, and
I asked him specifically,

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
do you think that Barney and
Betty Hill were lying to you?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
were not lying.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I hypnotized
them both separately.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Their stories were the same.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, George.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they saw.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
happened to them.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.510 align:middle line:84%
"But whatever happened to
them, they believe it to be.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not lying.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
They're telling
me the truth based

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.010 align:middle line:90%
on their own perspective."

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So I came away with
that interview,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Nick, believing that
here's a psychiatrist who

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.460 align:middle line:84%
admits they're
telling the truth,

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what they saw
or what happened to them.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But clearly says whatever they
said, they believe it to be.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's an amazing story.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yeah, and I would go
along with that with Roswell.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, of
these, there have

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:84%
been a few fakers and people
who've inserted themselves

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.820 align:middle line:90%
into the story.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the story's
just fallen apart.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:90%
But they're in the minority.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The people who recalled
seeing military

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
cordons keeping people
away from the crash site.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:84%
The military collecting
and scooping up

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:90%
all of this material.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The stories of Sheridan
Cavitt and Bill Rickett

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:90%
seeing the bodies.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Things like this, they're
not lying in the slightest.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.400 align:middle line:84%
The big question is,
what did they see?

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Did they say relatively
small aliens?

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they, in some cases,
see handicapped people

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.489 align:middle line:84%
who, at a distance,
well they were small.

00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:90%
They may have looked slightly--

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they have been
mangled with a crash like that?

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Yes, certainly,
they had been mangled.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably 24
hours after at least

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.860 align:middle line:90%
before Brazel found the bodies.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
were decomposing

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.393 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Decomposition.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Wild animals.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.736 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Animals.

00:46:07.736 --> 00:46:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: And so I don't
think the vast majority are

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.580 align:middle line:90%
lying at all.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective,
they're reporting exactly what

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.860 align:middle line:90%
they conclude happened.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But by the same token,
the people I interviewed

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:84%
were doing likewise,
but from the perspective

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of human experiments.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: Oh, it is.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the answer
is, Roswell is still

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:33.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be an important
aspect of ufology.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If it's proven to be
extraterrestrial, great.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:90%
We've won, so to speak.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.980 align:middle line:84%
If it proves not to be
extraterrestrial, but something

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
similar to what I'm
talking about or identical,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.700 align:middle line:84%
it will still be an
important part of ufology.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But from the perspective
of learning a lesson

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how belief
systems, facts, mythology,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.270 align:middle line:84%
anonymous witnesses, and
everything along those lines

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:84%
comes together to create
the story of Roswell.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think it will make people
perhaps not jump to the gun

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.970 align:middle line:84%
too quickly in other
sensational cases,

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:84%
but look at them from a
slower pace, a steadier pace.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And not elevate
them to a position

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:84%
where the big danger
is they could fall.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, what
does this tell you

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.495 align:middle line:84%
about government cover-ups
and government secrecy?

00:47:29.495 --> 00:47:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: Well, I think
the main thing it tells us

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.710 align:middle line:84%
about government secrecy
is that, in many cases,

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:38.440 align:middle line:84%
particularly like
Roswell, it's easy to hide

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the physical remains of whatever
happened because we don't have

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.380 align:middle line:90%
any of those.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the story of
Roswell clearly

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.640 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been hidden because
we're talking about it,

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and dozens of books have
been written on the subject.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.685 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem is,
for us, for the most part,

00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:57.930 align:middle line:84%
particularly when it comes
to the mainstream media,

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Roswell hasn't been believed.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:90%
It's believed by ufologists.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And in--

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And people.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.085 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:48:05.085 --> 00:48:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: And a lot of
people in the public,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.001 align:middle line:84%
the general public, are
entertained and intrigued

00:48:09.001 --> 00:48:10.430 align:middle line:90%
by Roswell.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But the very fact that
this secret revolves

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.490 align:middle line:84%
around something that
could involve aliens

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:84%
from another world, the problem
is that the mainstream media

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:90%
won't touch it.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.430 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
what this demonstrates,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.260 align:middle line:10%
when you come back
to your question,

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.370 align:middle line:10%
the more controversial
a secret is,

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.680 align:middle line:10%
ironically, it's easier to keep.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.960 align:middle line:10%
Because the more
controversy, people just

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:10%
say, well, that just
couldn't happen.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.770 align:middle line:90%
It's too out there.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So they walk away from
it, and they go what

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.210 align:middle line:90%
is more acceptable to them.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion will
we ever get the definitive proof

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:90%
about Roswell?

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REDFERN: I think we will.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.430 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think it's
going to come by disclosure.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.220 align:middle line:10%
I think it's going to come
through unforeseen ways.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Something surfaces by mistake.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.290 align:middle line:84%
An old guy who's got
a batch of material

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that he kept when
he left the base,

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.920 align:middle line:90%
it's sitting in his attic.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Or a ufological
Snowden comes along.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I think those are the
only potential ways

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:90%
this could happen.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.580 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: That's why we
call it Beyond Belief.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Belief is a program
that investigates the unknown,

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.180 align:middle line:90%
such as the Roswell case.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Will we ever get to the bottom?

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Will we ever find the truth?

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But we will continue
to seek the truth.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
