00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.878 align:middle line:10%
Now, regardless of the
side of the fence you're

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:10%
on with climate change,
there's no kidding yourself,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:10%
the world is changing.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at our next guest.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FEMALE VOICE: The
idea that people

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:84%
cause global warming
is just politically

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:90%
motivated propaganda.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the opinion of
Tim Ball, a geographer

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
and historical climatologist.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:10%
After earning his PhD from
Queen Mary University of London

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
in 1983, Tim moved
to Canada, where

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:10%
he taught at the University
of Winnipeg for over 25 years.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Tim rejects the
scientific consensus,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
arguing that carbon
dioxide isn't dangerous.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's essential.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
For the past decade,
Tim has waged

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
a war of ideas against the
environmental movement.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:10%
The author and co-author
of many papers,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:10%
he's also written a
book, "The Deliberate

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:10%
Corruption of Climate
Science," now in paperback.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
He'll explain that what you've
been told about the environment

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.685 align:middle line:90%
is more swindle than science.

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Tim, you've
been explaining for years now

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and sounding the alarm
that folks, what you think

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and what you hear
about climate change

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:90%
isn't necessarily the fact.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM BALL: More than isn't
necessary-- it isn't the facts.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.965 align:middle line:10%
It's spin.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:10%
It's for the media.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:10%
It's to get attention.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:10%
It's to persuade politicians
to pursue certain agendas,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:10%
political agendas.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically
to control people,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.975 align:middle line:10%
because that's what politics
is essentially all about.

00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As I said
at the outset too,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
there's no question that
the climate is changing.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Things are strange.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
This winter in most areas
has been very mild--

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
70 degree temperatures
in St. Louis,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:90%
where I go back and forth.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:90%
Denver, 70 degrees in February.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But these are
cycles, aren't they?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Well, it's not only
cycles, but it's not bizarre.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
about it, like Fox News

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:90%
has extreme weather.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's extreme weather?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
A hurricane is not
extreme weather.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But of course, what they're
really talking about

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.139 align:middle line:84%
is the damage it does
to people's lives.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.555 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
happened when they were saying,

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
oh, global warming's a
problem and hurricanes

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
are increasing, what was
really increasing what's

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
the cost of dealing with the
impact of hurricanes, not

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the actual hurricanes
themselves.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that creates this illusion

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that things are getting worse
or they've never been this bad

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.427 align:middle line:84%
is that it's like
when-- everybody's

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
had this experience.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
You're introduced
to somebody, and it

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.326 align:middle line:84%
seems like every
time you turn around,

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.006 align:middle line:84%
there they are or
there their name is.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
They were always
there, they were

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
just not part of your world or
your detection, if you want.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the media's caught on to
the global warming, the climate

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So every time there's a weather
event anywhere, it's reported

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's presented as if it's
abnormal, when in fact it's

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
perfectly normal.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So because the public don't
know how much climate changes

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and
extremely, then they're

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
very easily fooled into
believing that a normal event

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:90%
is abnormal.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:90%
And that we're causing it.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the image that
they create in people's minds,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and they use those terms.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Greenpeace
report on global warming

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
back in 1999, they
said, carbon dioxide

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
is added to the atmosphere
naturally and unnaturally.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do they mean by that?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the unnatural?

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
unnaturally is human.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, if that's true, then
if what humans do is unnatural,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
does that mean
humans are unnatural?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is the game
that they're playing.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They know the public
don't understand

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
the history of climate,
how much it changes.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
They also know that most of
them are terrified of science.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
You can divide the population
up into 80% percent

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that aren't students and 20%
that are science students.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.609 align:middle line:84%
And then amongst
that 20% of science,

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
the number that actually know
about climate and climate

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
science is very small.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very easy
to marginalize them.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody comes
along like me and says,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
no, what's happening
is perfectly normal.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It's well within natural
variability of climate-- oh,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
paid by the oil companies--
very easy to marginalize.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And you, in your programs,
know about how they do that.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, they'll create
a term to lump people in.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So for example, anybody who
asks anything about Obama's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
paperwork was a
birther which meant,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:90%
you're one of those birthers.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.884 align:middle line:84%
You're marginalized
outside of society.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.175 align:middle line:90%
You're not mainstream thinking.

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And so they did
that with the climate issue.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It started out as
global warming skeptic,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
until we started to point out
that, if you're not a skeptic,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
you're not a scientist.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
All scientists are skeptics.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Well then, as you know, warming
stopped happening around 1998,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
really started.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so then they
ran into a problem,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
because people
were saying, you're

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.513 align:middle line:84%
talking about global
warming and we're

00:05:29.513 --> 00:05:31.027 align:middle line:90%
having record cold winters.

00:05:31.027 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
The facts don't fit.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It doesn't make sense.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.805 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Doesn't make sense.

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So then they switched to climate
change, which allowed them then

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:90%
to incorporate--

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was broader.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>>BALL: But they also
changed the isolation

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:10%
of those that questioned,
because now if you challenged

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:10%
climate change,
you were a denier,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:10%
with of the Holocaust
connotations to that.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.499 align:middle line:84%
They upped the ante to isolate
anybody that dared question.

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To set the
stage, let's take

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
a little look at Al Gore in one
of his famous little speeches.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Just watch this, folks.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AL GORE: But there
is one relationship

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that is far more powerful than
all the others, and it is this.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:10%
When there is more
carbon dioxide,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:10%
the temperature gets warmer
because it traps more heat

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:10%
from the sun inside.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide,
having never gone

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
above 300 parts per million,
here is where CO2 is now.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Way above where it's ever been,
as far back as this record

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.064 align:middle line:10%
will measure.

00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Now if you'll bear
with me, I want

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:90%
to really emphasize this point.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The crew here has
tried to teach me how

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
to use this contraption here.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't kill myself,
I'll-- it's all ready right

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Look at how far above the
natural cycle this is.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And we've done that.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But ladies and gentlemen,
in the next 50 years,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
really in less
than 50 years, it's

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:90%
going to continue to go up.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
When some of these children
who are here are my age,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.505 align:middle line:84%
here's what it's going to
be in less than 50 years.

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of off the charts--

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:90%
it'll be here.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single
fact or date or number

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that's been used to make this
up that's in any controversy.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The so-called skeptics look
at this and they say, so?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:90%
That seems perfectly OK.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.942 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when did Al
Gore become a climatologist?

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Well, that's
an interesting thing,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
because the minute I go on any
program, they immediately say,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:90%
what are your qualifications?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever asks Al Gore
that, but that's the way

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%
of the world these days.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.575 align:middle line:84%
Gore hired Hollywood to help
him make that documentary,

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and that was the perfect
people to make it,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's from the
land of make-believe.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The science of that-- and it's
a marvelous piece of propaganda.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.586 align:middle line:84%
Leni Riefenstahl would
appreciate the talents in that.

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
motivation behind that?

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: The motivation
was to isolate CO2

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:90%
as the cause of global warming.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
And what he's doing there-- it's
false information, by the way.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:90%
He says, the highest level ever.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's at
the lowest level

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:90%
in a very, very long time.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean
in 300 million years.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The average level of CO2 for
the last 300 million years

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
has been around 1,200
parts per million.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pieces
of science that

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
supports that is that in
commercial greenhouses

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
now today, they pump in up to
1,200 parts per million of CO2.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The plants grow
four times more--

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Faster.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.647 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Yeah, much faster,
and use less water.

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And bigger.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And I think
that 300 million years

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:90%
is when plants evolved.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think they evolved to an
optimum level of CO2 of about

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.164 align:middle line:90%
1,200 parts per million.

00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And you could argue that
they're malnourished.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:10%
In fact, NASA brought out
satellite imagery showing how,

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:10%
because of the increase of CO2
that's occurring naturally,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:10%
the plant is expanded
around the world.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a positive thing.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
But they wanted to demonize CO2.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that they
did that was-- actually it

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
goes back to, not about climate
change or global warming

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the argument
that the world is overpopulated.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the argument is that
the world's overpopulated,

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and as it industrializes, it
uses more and more resources

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and that will ultimately
run out of resources.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:10%
That was encapsulated
in that book

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:10%
by the Club of Rome,
"The Limits to Growth,"

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.817 align:middle line:10%
where they very simplistically
said, here's the resource

00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:10%
and here's the rate at
which we're using it.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And none of that's
turned out to be

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:90%
true at all-- absolutely false.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
Malthusian idea.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Because Malthus said
that the population would

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:90%
outgrow the food supply.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
That's equally turned
out to be wrong.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Malthus had
a great influence on science,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because Darwin took Malthus'
essays on population with him

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to the Galapagos and said
they were the guiding

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.291 align:middle line:84%
influence on his ideas about
the theory of evolution,

00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
which is an interesting thing.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, Tim, when we
talk about climate change,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the side
of the fence you're on,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:90%
why is it so argumentative?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so bitter?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I've seen it.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even during my
open line phone calls

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast," if we
talk about climate change

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
or even when you're
on as a guest,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a handful
of people-- minute,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
but they're so angry if you
don't believe it's man-made.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Well, because it's
not a scientific belief.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a political and
ideological belief.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.717 align:middle line:84%
Because what they argued
was the Club of Rome,

00:11:13.717 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
which promoted "The
Limits to Growth,"

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and pushed the overpopulation of
Paul Ehrlich-- and by the way,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Obama's science
czar, John Holdren,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.524 align:middle line:84%
who published with
Paul Ehrlich--

00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who wants
population control.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: He wants population
control, exactly.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And so you read the Club
of Rome book, the 1994 book

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:90%
by Alexander King.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And they say that we need
something to unite us.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
need a global threat

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that we can then use to say,
hey, this needs one world

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:90%
government to deal with it.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't rely on
individual nations.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gotta
do it as a whole.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Yeah.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we need something--
so they listed some things.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:90%
They listed pollution.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:90%
They listed water resources.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's
going to be the next issue.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they say,
global warming.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And so Maurice Strong, who
just passed away in China,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and came from a socialist
family, his sister,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or his aunt, I should say,
Anna Strong, was a Marxist,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
moved to communist
China in the 1930s,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and became an adviser
to Mao Tse-tung.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So they come from a very
socialist background.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And Strong, in an interview
in a wonderful book

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
by Elaine Dewar, who
was one of, like you,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the original true
investigative journalists--

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.545 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start with an idea,
but if I find that I'm wrong,

00:12:37.545 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm going to flex it.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: She wanted to
write a book praising

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Canadian environmentalists, like
David Suzuki, Elizabeth May,

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and Maury Strong.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Halfway through
her research, she

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
found out these people were more
corrupt than the people they

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
were attacking.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So she wrote the book, "Cloak
of Green" And about 20%

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
percent of the book is
devoted to Maury Strong.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.092 align:middle line:84%
And she said to Strong,
well, what's the problem?

00:13:04.092 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, the problem
with the world

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
is the industrialized
nations, that they're

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
destroying the planet, and
isn't it our responsibility

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.871 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of them.

00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wasn't just
talking about it

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.724 align:middle line:90%
from a pollution point of view.

00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about it
from the point of view

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.037 align:middle line:84%
that they are using up resources
at a much greater risk.

00:13:19.037 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So let's wipe them out.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.742 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Let's wipe them out.

00:13:21.742 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's think about that.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:90%
How would you do that?

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that that's the
genius, or if you want,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.574 align:middle line:84%
the evil genius of these people,
is not only having the idea.

00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we all
have lots of ideas.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But putting them into practice
is another whole game.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they looked at
the whole issue and said,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
well, if we consider a
nation like a car running

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
on fossil fuels, you got
the fossil fuel going in,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
you can stop the engine by
squeezing off the fossil fuel

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you did that
in a nation, people

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.821 align:middle line:90%
would scream immediately.

00:13:56.821 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And you see that with whenever
the gasoline prices went up,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
people were outraged.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But you can also stop the
engine by plugging the exhaust.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So they said, OK, what's the
byproduct of the fossil fuel

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:90%
industry?

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, mostly CO2.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.772 align:middle line:84%
So they said, let's show that
CO2 is causing global warming.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just make it happen.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Make it happen.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And what Maurice Strong
did-- and by the way,

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Elaine Dewar said to him,
well, you got this idea.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you run for politics?

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He made a very telling
comment when he said,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
you can't do anything
as a politician.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And that, by the way,
parallels Conrad Black,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.984 align:middle line:84%
a name that Americans
are familiar with.

00:14:36.984 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said to him one time,
why aren't you in politics?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
need to be, which

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is a very telling comment about
the state of politics today.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And you see that, of course,
in terms of influence

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:90%
of donors and everything else.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.862 align:middle line:84%
But Elaine Dewar
said to him, well,

00:14:50.862 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to
implement this idea?

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going to
go to the United Nations

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.859 align:middle line:84%
where I can get all
the money I want

00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and not be accountable
to anybody.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
He then went to
the United Nations

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to set up the United Nations
Environment Program, which

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
was the Rio conference, which
George Herbert Bush said,

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.765 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to it.

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.939 align:middle line:84%
It's political nonsense,
and refused to go.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a football.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Yeah.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And there, at that
conference, he

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
set up Agenda 21, which I
know you've done programs on.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That was the
political side of it.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the political side
of it with the climate,

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.479 align:middle line:84%
they set up what was called
the Conference of the Parties.

00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a term that people
will have heard recently,

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
because the Paris Climate
Conference was the Conference

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Parties number 21.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they determine how much
money is going to be spent

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and what politics is going to
occur with regard to climate.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But they can only operate
on the basis of the science

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that they're being given by
the Intergovernmental Panel

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
on Climate Change,
the IPCC, which

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
was set up through the United
Nations Framework Convention

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:90%
on Climate Change.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the
interesting thing.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to step aside
from that for a minute.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I've served on many commissions
of inquiry-- federal,

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
provincial, or state
level and so on.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.689 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think commissions
of inquiry were great.

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot of people do.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You finally get the politics
out of the nonsense.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Just get somebody--

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
run by the politicians.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.603 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: But people
don't realize that,

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and don't realize how they run.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found out the first
commission of inquiry

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.546 align:middle line:84%
I was appointed to, because
it was dispute over a lake.

00:16:26.546 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
fights over water

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.294 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
much, much more--

00:16:29.294 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going
to be huge, huge.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Wars will be fought.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.465 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: And have been.

00:16:33.465 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:90%
And have been.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.522 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, finally
the politicians said,

00:16:38.522 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
a commission inquiry.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Everybody cheered.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The politician's
now off the hook.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the media say,
well, what about this issue?

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
committee's job.

00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Got to wait
till they reply.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Then we got the terms of
reference for the commission.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They were so limited to
pre-determine the outcome.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.147 align:middle line:84%
And I did something that
I'm actually quite proud of.

00:17:01.147 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I told the chairman of the
commission, Mr. Duncan,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, you go
tell the minister.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Either we get carte blanche to
all of the information, nothing

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.828 align:middle line:84%
hidden, or I'm going to
go to the media and say,

00:17:11.828 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
the minister's trying
to predetermine

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the outcome of this commission.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.416 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Now, you
know, on your program

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
you deal with
conspiracy theories.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And the internet, of course,
has fostered so many of those.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest in the
world is, who killed Kennedy?

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've
talked about revisiting

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:90%
that in your program.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was watching
Justice Warren one

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
time-- I believe it was
ABC-- before he passed away.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer said,
well, why didn't you

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
look at the Dallas Mafia
connection with Jack Ruby.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And Warren said, it wasn't
in my terms of reference.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I knew what he was saying.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He was saying I was
told not to go there.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
audience, that would

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:90%
have just slipped right by them.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was the
key to the entire puzzle.

00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Exactly, exactly.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Trump is pushing
another one now with the 9/11

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
inquiry, where he's saying,
what's in those 28 pages

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:90%
they're not telling you?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
conspiracy theories start.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:90%
They start in the cover-up.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So when Maurice Strong set up
the Intergovernmental Panel

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
on Climate Change, they wrote
the definition and terms

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of reference that
predetermined the outcome.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:90%
And how did they do that?

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
They defined and directed
them to only look

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
at human causes
of climate change.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't look
at any of the natural causes.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Just look at the human causes.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't
possibly determine

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
any possible human causes
if you don't know what

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
the natural consequences are.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:90%
So it really narrowed it down.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And just to give you an example,
CO2 as a greenhouse gas-- and I

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
debate whether it is
even one-- it's only 4%

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
of the total greenhouse gases.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Water vapor is 95%.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
What does the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change do?

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, water vapor,
humans produce a little,

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's so insignificant
compared to the total.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
assume it's constant.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
How can you do that?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the variance
in water vapor

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
each year more than
swamps any possible effect

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that CO2 changes
might be having.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But because their
terms of reference

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
set that, and then, of course,
noticing in Gore's movie

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that you showed, he
said, CO2 increases,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:90%
temperature increases.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Every single record--
and remember,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm a historical climatologist.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I've looked at all this.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This has
been your business.

00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: This is my
business-- including

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:90%
the record that Gore showed.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And you notice how he
separated the temperature

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
from the CO2 level.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, within five years
of that chart coming out,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that's the Antarctic ice core
record, where they supposedly

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:90%
sampled CO2 in temperature.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And Jouzel, the French
scientist that brought that out

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.485 align:middle line:84%
in 1991, Petit and Jouzel--
Jouzel warned about it.

00:20:06.485 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, don't rush
to judgment on this.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's a graph that's
4 and 1/2 inches long covering

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:90%
400,000 years.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but it's
been smoothed by 70 years,

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
so you've taken all of the
variability out of it, which is

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:90%
what explains the mechanisms.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But within five years, it was
disclosed that in that graph,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:84%
the temperature changes before
the CO2, not as they assume,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that CO2 causes
temperature increase.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So Gore's argument there
is completely wrong.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
The only place-- and I've
joked about this-- not joked.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.950 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing funny
about this thing.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I've said the only
place in the world

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:84%
where a CO2 increase causes
a temperature increase is

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in the computer models
of the Intergovernmental

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Panel on Climate Change.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tim, we went
out to the streets

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to talk to people
about climate denier.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.665 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:20:57.665 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN 1: To global
warming deniers,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I would ask them to be a
little more open-minded,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
perhaps read up on
it a little more.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be critical.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be skeptical.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there
are some very intelligent

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
scientists who have done
some serious study into this.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is
pretty darn clear.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.186 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN 2: Ask them if
they've read the science.

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the important part.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't, if they
haven't read the science,

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.835 align:middle line:90%
then you can't argue with them.

00:21:31.835 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN 1: Develop a
relationship with the Earth

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll see
that it's changing

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.135 align:middle line:84%
and that it's being
destroyed by our very hands.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN 2: To look around
and realize, hello,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like 60, 70
degrees in February.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.555 align:middle line:84%
I think the proof
is in the pudding.

00:21:54.555 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So those are some
of the comments of people

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Boulder area that you
of course would not agree with.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: No.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And I sympathize with
them, because they

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
are fed the constant message.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.510 align:middle line:10%
And of course that's
one of the things

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:10%
that you do when you're
pushing a political message

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:10%
is you use propaganda.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that in one
of the earlier comments,

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:90%
the comment was, the consensus.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.942 align:middle line:84%
And that was an argument that
was used from the very start.

00:22:20.942 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that's not true.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.044 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: No, because consensus
has nothing to do with science.

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, I could have
100 facts that prove me right.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Only get one wrong,
and I'm done.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that
was also corrupted.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Naomi Oreskes,
the woman came out

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and said that she done a
study, a Google search,

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and found-- I think Gore
mentions it in his movie, 900

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and some articles, all of them
supporting the official story

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:90%
on global warming.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But anybody that's ever
done a Google search

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:84%
knows that the answers you get
are determined by the key words

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:90%
that you use.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I've
learned how to play that.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Because when I want
an article published,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I make sure there's
certain key words

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:90%
are in the title of the article.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That gets you up there.

00:23:04.293 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Oh, it bumps you up.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.886 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way,
as people know,

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.301 align:middle line:84%
you get the right
sequence of letters

00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and so on in the
telephone book, you

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
can get at the front
of the telephone.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:84%
People know how to
play those games.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of a
consensus-- then of course

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.105 align:middle line:84%
it was further corrupted
by Cook and the University

00:23:21.105 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
of Queensland in Australia,
where they came out and said,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:90%
97% of scientists agree.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the real number?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it 50-50?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: No.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Lord Monckton, in
that particular study,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Monckton actually
analyzed their own data.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And what they'd done
was they determined

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:90%
what they thought was agreeing.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:84%
When you actually looked,
by their own definition,

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:90%
it was only 3% that agreed.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 3%.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: But here's
the problem, George.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I've got a quote on
the cover of my book

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
from a German
meteorologist and physicist

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Klaus-Eckart Puls.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was out there
pushing the IPCC line--

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, global warming,
humans are causing it, CO2.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, I finally-- somebody
challenged me about something,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
so I went and read what
the IPCC had written.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I discovered it was
absolute nonsense.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:90%
It was scientific rubbish.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just assumed
that other scientists

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't cheat.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so very few
scientists have even

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
looked at the
science of climate.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And here's
the big question--

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
why are they pushing this?

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the bottom line here?

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I've always told myself, look
at who benefits, who profits.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.609 align:middle line:90%
Why is this being pushed?

00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: There's two
parts about that.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And you and I know--
Rush Limbaugh always

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:84%
pushes the thing about
follow the money.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about that is the money

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
only influences people
up to a certain level.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Money is not going to
influence a billionaire.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It's power.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the power.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: At a certain
level, it's power.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Maurice
Strong was about.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what George
Soros is about,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that all of these people,
it's about the power.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the money
comes with the power.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.439 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
main motivation.

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:14.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
the aphrodisiac.

00:25:14.855 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: It's not the
aphrodisiac, exactly.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to
why they isolated CO2.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They wanted something--
they wanted global warming

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted an issue
that would unite people.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it killed
the coal industry.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.772 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Of course.

00:25:31.772 --> 00:25:33.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've wiped them out.

00:25:33.105 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Exactly.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And Obama told you he
was going to do that.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
In his election
campaign, he said, yeah,

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:90%
you could open a coal mine.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'll put you
out of business.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll tax you out of business.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
What he ignores is the
fact that Mr. Murray, who

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
had been in the coal
business for years, he

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:84%
with two other
businesspeople built

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
a plant in North
Dakota that actually

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.101 align:middle line:90%
burns coal absolutely clean.

00:25:59.101 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to know.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't
hear anything about that.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.788 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: You don't hear
anything about it.

00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But the objective was,
it's all about the power.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they needed
something, first of all,

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:90%
that transcended nationalism.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, the nation-state,
which really only emerged

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:84%
after the Treaty of Versailles,
the First World War and Woodrow

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Wilson, every nation
has a right to a state.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
You see the debate about
Palestine and Israel

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of it.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
things are still

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
working their way through
our system with boundaries

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Slowly.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: But in order
to overcome that,

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
you needed an issue that
transcended boundaries.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So of course, pollution
and global warming--

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.969 align:middle line:84%
it's like I always
used to point out

00:26:41.969 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to Canadians that the most
polluted city in Canada

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:90%
is Windsor, Ontario.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spent many days
there coming from Detroit.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: It's coming across
the river from Detroit.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So I told Windsor, I said you
should just put big fans up

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:90%
and blow it back.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:90%
So why did they do that?

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, because they believe
that the only way to run people

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.859 align:middle line:84%
and to run the world properly
is to have a single government.

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what they want.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.316 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: That's what they
want, one world government.

00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:14.787 align:middle line:90%
And Maurice Strong admits that.

00:27:14.787 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And God
knows they're trying.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And Maurice
strong actually

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
had a quote that Elaine
Dewar says when he says,

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm a socialist
ideologically but I'm

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:90%
a capitalist practically.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So he's got this blend of being
a socialist and a capitalist.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And you see that with George
Soros, the same thing.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You also see it, of
course, politically,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
where you see countries
like Russia and China,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
which are basically what
I call state capitalism,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that they're attempting
to blend the two.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they really
are so different

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally that
they really can't

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
be-- it's a marriage
that's doomed to fail.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the climate change
believers that it's man-made,

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I would guess most of them
are confusing pollution

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and our need to protect
the planet that way

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:90%
from climate change.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And that was
deliberately created.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Al Gore was
one of the first

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
to start saying that pollution--
and you hear Obama saying,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:90%
carbon pollution.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
it isn't carbon.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Carbon is a solid.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It's soot.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it can be a pollutant.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly black
coming from coal.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.691 align:middle line:90%
But CO2 is a gas.

00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
different things.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.648 align:middle line:84%
Yet the public don't even know
the difference between them.

00:28:34.648 --> 00:28:36.855 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, Obama
doesn't know or want

00:28:36.855 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to know the difference
between the two.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had more CO2
during the dinosaur eras.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
dinosaurs were so big.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
plants were so big.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Of course.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've also had
some of the lowest

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
levels of CO2-- sorry,
the highest levels of CO2

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.805 align:middle line:84%
during ice ages, 320
million years ago.

00:28:55.805 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
history of the relationship

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.009 align:middle line:84%
to CO2 and temperature,
doesn't match.

00:29:01.009 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by the way,
CO2 is great for plants.

I want you to look at that, Tim.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.725 align:middle line:90%

In most areas, it's

very few of them.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%

look at, supposedly,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the best instrumental
stations in the world, which

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:90%
are the American ones.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And he found that only--
correct me on this,

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's approximately 8% that
are accurate to within one

happening, not
only on our planet,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%

>>BALL: Of course.

00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And you got those

They don't have factories

Maybe, they might-- who knows.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Carl Satan was one

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:84%
of the ones who got involved
in that, because Sagan

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and his gang were saying
that the temperature on Venus

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
is such and such a level
because of the CO2 levels.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a story we
should do one time on Immanuel

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:90%

What they did to him,
what the scientific--

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:90%
they destroyed him.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Velikovsky was predicting the
temperature level on Venus

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:90%
would be very different.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.010 align:middle line:90%
He turned out to be right.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he believes
that Venus was a comet.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: It came
into the global--

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.705 align:middle line:84%
but Sagan actually
produced and edited

00:32:55.705 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Scientists
Confront Velikovsky."

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
That's where the CO2 and
planets things came in.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But go back, your question about
the sun-- go back to my comment

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:84%
about the definition
given to the IPCC.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:84%
See, if you're only
looking at human causes,

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
humans don't affect the sun, so
we don't have to look at that.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.744 align:middle line:10%
So rule that out.

00:33:17.744 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Rule that out.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, we'll only
look at CO2, methane.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember even before
CO2 was a big issue,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:90%
methane was a big issue.

>>NOORY: Tim, explain
the controversy

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%

ago with the emails coming

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:90%
from man-made climate believers.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.442 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:33:43.442 --> 00:33:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: OK, what
happened, remember

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:84%
earlier I talked
to you about how

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the Conference of the
Parties could only

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
make policy and money spending
based upon the science

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
that the IPCC were giving them.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The Conference of the Parties
meet every year in November.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why in Paris,
it was November.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And they meet at exotic
places around the world

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.590 align:middle line:90%
a taxpayers' expense.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Copenhagen
conference, COP, was COP 15.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was a pivotal one.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.781 align:middle line:84%
It was important
to them, because it

00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:84%
was the one at which
they were going

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to introduce the whole
Kyoto Protocol, which

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
was the great socialist
equalization of wealth,

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
taking money from those
nasty industrialized nations

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.429 align:middle line:84%
that it got wealthy
producing CO2.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:35.214 align:middle line:84%
They had to pay the other
nations that had suffered,

00:34:35.214 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the developing nations-- it
was a great transfer of wealth

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.860 align:middle line:90%
is what it was.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
Somebody realized
that Copenhagen

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
was critical to the whole
policy going forward.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So they leaked emails from
the Climatic Research Unit

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of East Anglia.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the scientists
that control the IPCC,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.110 align:middle line:84%
such as Phil Jones,
who controlled

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:84%
the modern temperature record,
such as Michael Mann, who

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:84%
controlled the
historic temperature

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
record, such as
Andrew Weaver, who

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:90%
was with the computer models.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.260 align:middle line:84%
They controlled
the key chapters.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody
leaked their emails.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.865 align:middle line:90%
And it was interesting because--

00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which put
them in a bad light.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Oh, it
exposed what they were

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:90%
doing, how they were doing it.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.385 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's absolutely--

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their actual emails.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Actual
emails were leaked.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
was interesting was

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
under normal circumstances,
they could have come out

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, those
are not our emails.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But Phil Jones, the
director, was caught.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if the
emails were hacked,

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
then they could not
be used in court.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
If they were stolen, they
could be used in court.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if they
were leaked, in other words,

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.450 align:middle line:84%
how they were
released determined

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.540 align:middle line:84%
how they could be dealt
with in the court, exactly.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And so Jones called the police
immediately and told the police

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:84%
he had to admit, yeah,
those are our emails.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
he had already

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.820 align:middle line:84%
admitted that they
were their emails.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
the analysis of that

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:14.972 align:middle line:84%
went on to show how
they were-- they

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
were actually controlling
the peer review

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:84%
process, which is why they
made a big deal out of it.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.691 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
sleep with themselves?

00:36:20.691 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:90%
You would think.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Tim, that they would just
want the truth to come out.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And if the planet's
going through a cycle,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:90%
it's going through a cycle.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets hotter or
colder, that's not the point.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The point is, it's
not caused by us.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: I'm not a
psychologist and I

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
can't get into all of that.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
as humans, we're

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:90%
very good at rationalizing.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And we could rationalize
our way out of anything.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you disappointed
by the real scientists

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.697 align:middle line:90%
who keep pushing this agenda?

00:36:56.697 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Yes, particularly
because they don't go and read

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:90%
what was actually done.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.356 align:middle line:84%
The minute any of them go and
read what's actually done--

00:37:03.356 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
change their minds.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.063 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: They change their minds.

00:37:06.063 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And you saw Will
Happer from Princeton

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.010 align:middle line:90%
and all of these people.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John Coleman,
the old weatherman,

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.350 align:middle line:84%
founder of the Weather Channel,
he's a staunch believer

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that it's not man-made
climate change.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And he knew
Revelle, who was

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
the guy that Gore is saying,
oh, Revelle believed in this.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
John Coleman knew
Revelle and said, no, he

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't say that at all.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But at that level, the public
are lost in the argument.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap things
up, Tim, how dangerous is it?

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:84%
How dangerous is it for science
to keep pushing this agenda

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that man-made climate
change is the cause for all

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:90%
these problems?

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: I think the
credibility of science

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
is in serious trouble, not just
because of the climate issue.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:55.010 align:middle line:84%
You know-- it started by
the way in court cases,

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.615 align:middle line:84%
and the first scientists
were the psychiatrists.

00:37:57.615 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And they'd get
one that would say

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.114 align:middle line:84%
the guy's sane and the
other one to say he's crazy.

00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:02.935 align:middle line:90%
Well, aren't they scientists?

00:38:02.935 --> 00:38:03.735 align:middle line:90%
Don't they agree?

00:38:03.735 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Find some
middle ground here.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Now, what you're seeing
is, oh, butter's bad for you.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Now butter's good
for you. [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:90%
is good for you, now had.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Margarine was
good for you, now it's not.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.215 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: And so the whole
credibility of science

00:38:18.215 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
is under question.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.832 align:middle line:84%
And this climate issue is going
to be particularly egregious.

00:38:24.832 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've been working on

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
for about 15 years now is, when
the public realized the extent

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to which they've been fooled,
deliberately fooled by this,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
they'll start to say, we
don't believe in anything

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.555 align:middle line:90%
you tell us.

00:38:38.555 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fool me once--

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BALL: Yeah.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the sad thing,
because as you said earlier,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:90%
pollution's a problem.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Environment's an issue.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We all care about
the environment.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.947 align:middle line:84%
But notice what
these people did.

00:38:48.947 --> 00:38:50.280 align:middle line:90%
They took the moral high ground.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
We're the only guys that
care about the environment.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:90%
The rest you don't care.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:90%
How dare you do that!

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.560 align:middle line:90%
But they wanted the dominance.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, one of the
countries that broke that cycle

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
was India, because the prime
minister of India, Modi,

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:84%
went and I've worked with
Indian climatologists.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:90%
They know the signs very well.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And Modi looked at it and said,
OK, what you're telling us

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a 2% chance
that the temperature might go up

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.460 align:middle line:84%
by half a degree in
the next 50 years.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:10%
And the probability
of that is very slim.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:10%
And he said, we got
more important issues.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:84%
We've got people
starving to death.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's get the priority.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.142 align:middle line:84%
That took that moral high ground
away from these enviro bullies.

00:39:29.142 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as
you said, the water

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
will become a huge
issue one day.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.980 align:middle line:10%
>>BALL: They're already
switching to that.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Peter Gleich, who is involved
in the global warming issue

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.940 align:middle line:10%
out at Stanford, he's now
coined the phrase "peak water."

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:39:41.095 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:90%
That one could be real.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:84%
There is no peak
oil, but water--

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
we got to make sure
people can treat water.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: But it's the
greatest deception history.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BALL: Thank you for
the opportunity, George.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Folks, regardless
of your belief system

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:84%
of climate change,
there's no doubt

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that things are
happening on this planet.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The only advice I
could give you is

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:84%
listen to people like Dr.
Tim Ball, who are telling you

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%
the way they see it.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.920 align:middle line:10%
And then you make up
your own mind as well.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:18.300 align:middle line:90%
