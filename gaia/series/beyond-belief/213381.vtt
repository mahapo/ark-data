00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:10%
Preston Dennett is with us, the
author of more than 30 books

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds of articles
on the topics of UFOs, ETs,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:10%
and the paranormal.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, initially,
Preston was a skeptic

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and he became interested in
these topics back in 1986

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
after learning that his family,
friends, and co-workers were all

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:90%
having experiences.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.795 align:middle line:84%
Preston, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PRESTON DENNETT:
Thank you very much.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.717 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And at
the end of the program,

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be talking
to an ET contactee that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
came to you in a
very strange way,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.945 align:middle line:84%
but I'll have you tell
us about that later on.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: All right.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How you been?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Good, yeah.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.215 align:middle line:90%
Very busy, doing well.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.622 align:middle line:90%
doing what you're doing?

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I got dragged into it
kicking and screaming, honestly.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:10%
Very skeptical, did
not believe in UFOs

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:10%
but heard about a sighting on
the news November 17, 1986.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Never forget it.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:10%
Very famous sighting
of a UFO over Alaska.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you've probably heard
of it, Captain Terauchi.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: And
it's a major case,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
but the news report was very
tongue-in-cheek, very short.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But it interested
me enough because I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
remembered my older brother
Marco said he'd seen a UFO.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him
about it, and he

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
described this
amazing sighting where

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:84%
he chased a UFO down
the Reseda Boulevard

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:90%
in Southern California.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%
This was late 1970s or so.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, he described
a metallic craft,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
colored lights, tree-top level.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
He chased it with his two
friends for about 15 minutes.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.213 align:middle line:84%
And when he told me
this, it blew my mind.

00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if he catches it, right?

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: It would stop
and wait for him actually,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
playing this almost
little cat and mouse game.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wrap
my head around it.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
He was like, listen,
talk to my friends.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.719 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
set the ball rolling.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I found out that I had
several family members who

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
had had major encounters.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:90%
His sister-in-law--

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that when
you decided, though,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to get involved
in studying UFOs?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: It took me
about a year, actually.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Finding out that I had
friends who had missing time.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.585 align:middle line:84%
People at work
had seen Grey ETs.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started
buying all these books.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:90%
I was going to disprove it.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tried to.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I tried to, yeah,
because I was very skeptical.

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you get books by
Stanton Friedman and people

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Every book I
could find, and ended up

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:90%
joining every UFO group.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.485 align:middle line:84%
I became a field
investigator for MUFON.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: MUFON, yeah.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Mutual UFO Network.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, in a space of a year
or two, it took over my life.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you concluded
now about what's been going on?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Well, one,
it's absolutely real.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I think we are being visited
by ETs, extraterrestrials,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
people like us
from other planets.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I think they have
multiple agendas.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
anything nefarious

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of them trying
to take over or hurt

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
people or anything like that.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.612 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David Jacobs
thinks it is, but--

00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I'm
aware of that, yeah.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I know there are some people
who have a pretty negative view

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
on this, but I had to step back
because one of my first cases

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
involved a lady
who was physically

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
healed during her
encounter of her cyst.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started finding
other cases like that.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
onboard experience is really

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
one of healing, guiding,
teaching, warning,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
waking people up to their
own psychic abilities.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about this
episode with this lady.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, it was one
of my first major cases.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:84%
She had quite a few
corroborating witnesses.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Ended up showing
me a UFO herself.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So I know she's for real.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she called
them down, but she

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
described how she
had been diagnosed

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
with a cyst in her
fallopian tubes.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost
ovarian, practically.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.318 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, right.

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty, you know,
a severe condition,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
causing her a lot of issues.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:90%
She was scheduled for surgery.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was the day before
that ETs came into her room.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't remember a
whole lot of what happened.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
However, she went to
the doctor the next day

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and they did the pre-op
imaging and came in and said,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
well, this is very strange.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
We cannot find your cyst.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, it's gone.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.478 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Absolute
evidence that she

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
had had some sort of
surgery because there was

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
laser scarring on her abdomen.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There was fluid
that was present.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she didn't
remember really what happened?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: No, but I started
getting other cases like this.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started documenting
healing cases.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made
you believe her?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Well, initially,
I was very skeptical,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
but I was transcribing
her interview, actually.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sudden impulse
to go onto the roof of my condo

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:90%
where I lived at the time.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
This was an overpowering
impulse I could not resist.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Walked up there and
a UFO showed up.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is my first
really major sighting.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I've had a couple, but this
UFO showed up and actually

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
gave me a telepathic message.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Honest to god, never had an
experience like this before.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was the message?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: It said, hi, it's us.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I won't use her real name, but
they said it's Wendy's ETFs.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
We're for real.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
She's telling the truth.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:90%
If you don't believe, watch.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
We'll prove it.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And this darn UFO, which was a
large, brilliant, golden object,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
probably 10, 20 feet
across, 200 or 300 feet away

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
max, tree-top level, it
started darting back and forth

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
in nonconventional movement.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it spoke to me.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.865 align:middle line:84%
Not in so many words,
but a fairly clear--

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you in shock?

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I fell back
on the wall there.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could not
believe my eyes.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
want with you, Preston?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: They wanted me to
know she was telling the truth.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because you doubted it?

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: I did.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Because her story was so
extensive, very intense.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
She was talking about being
taken on board hybrid,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%
half-human half-Grey--

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All her story
aside for a moment,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
what happened to her
cyst if it wasn't

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:90%
some kind of ET intervention?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, it was gone.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A miracle?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I would say
it was an ET healing.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It follows the pattern that I
found in many, many other cases.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I've documented about
300-plus cases of healings.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they heal
people more often than not?

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I would say it's
a very consistent feature

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of an onboard experience.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There has been studies anywhere
from 10% all the way up

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to 50% of cases
involve healings.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's somewhere
in between there.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
In my own files,
it's about 20% to 30%

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of people
get healed and don't know it

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
or don't talk about it perhaps.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of diseases
are there that they heal?

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, it's up
and down, across the board.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just everything that--

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
heart ailments, kidney issues,
liver issues, you name it.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Heart disease,
kidney stones, liver disease,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
cuts and bruises, colds,
flus, diphtheria, arthritis.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, I mean, cancer.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I've got 30-some documented
cases and some are very well--

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are people
who conventional medicine could

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:90%
not help?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Correct,
in a lot of cases.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then do they have
a recollection of the healing

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.797 align:middle line:90%
by the ETs?

00:08:08.797 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Often, they do.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Not always.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And they occur in
many different ways.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes someone will
be in their bedroom

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and ETs will just show up.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
One guy was cured of
a hernia that way.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They just used a little
handheld instrument.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It's often involving
lights of some form.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed another guy who
was cured of a blood clot.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
A couple of cases
of that, actually.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those that know
they've been healed by ETs

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
probably are very forthright
in telling you what's going on.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Those that don't recall ET
intervention, what do they think

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.185 align:middle line:90%
happened to themselves?

00:08:44.185 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah,
they don't know.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Some might categorize it
as an angelic visitation.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a very well-known
medical documented phenomena,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous remission.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people just don't
know how to explain it.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're convinced
it's ET intervention?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
When someone has a
UFO hovering overhead,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
sending down a beam of light.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there's very
well-documented case

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of a police officer who was
cured of a cut on his hand.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Another of a customs
official in, I

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
believe it was Brazil, who
was struck by a beam of light,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
cured him of rheumatism
and nearsightedness.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do these
cases come to you, Preston?

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Initially,
I just scoured

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
the literature looking for
them and found about 30 of them

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.827 align:middle line:90%
right off the bat.

00:09:32.827 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it say?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.285 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't
say, you know,

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Joe Blow has been taken
by an ET and his diabetes

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.318 align:middle line:84%
is solved or something
like that, does it?

00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: There's a few.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these cases didn't
get a lot of coverage

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're sort of on
the fringe of the fringe.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a lot of
fear surrounding this subject

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and cases of healing
weren't getting

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot of attention.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
skepticism surrounding them.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly,
the illness was there

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and recorded medically, right?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, there's some
very well-documented cases.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:84%
A lady was cured
of Chagas disease

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and fully-documented
how the ETs healed her.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when it's
gone, that's documented?

00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely, yeah.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are mainstream
doctors tell their patients when

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:90%
they're gone?

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Well, they
have a hard time with it.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
One gentleman I interviewed
who was diagnosed with cancer

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
was very forthright
with his doctors.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them are.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And they just recorded
in his medical records,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
which he sent to me as
a miraculous healing

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't there
to see the ETFs doing it.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
They can't say this
is an ET healing,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:90%
but they could not explain it.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And often, what's
really interesting

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is people will have
a healing and they're

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with some condition,
be it cancer or whatever,

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're scheduled
to have an operation.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually like the
day before that the ETs

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
will come and heal them.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But I've got about
10% of the cases

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is so interesting to
me because they occur anywhere.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But 10% occur in hospitals,
in the hospital itself.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While they're waiting
for their surgery or something

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: A mysterious
doctor or nurse will walk

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
in who's a little bit unusual
looking, hypnotic eyes or--

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a
physical ET presence?

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know how this must sound
to skeptics in particular,

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.272 align:middle line:84%
but as any researcher knows, an
encounter can happen anywhere.

00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've got
cases where people

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:90%
were visited in hotel rooms.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a common
denominator with these people

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:90%
who have illnesses?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Are they all believers,
for example, all skeptics?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely not.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are skeptics.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Some might be very religious.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Others are atheists.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Men, women, children.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: All different
ages all over the world.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Cases reach back about 100
years up to the present day.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I couldn't find
any real common denominator

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:90%
except a couple.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I figured it out once
when this lady called me

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
from Norway who had been
healed of a chronic back pain.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And she had no prior
history of contacts,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
which is definitely a pattern.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Often, someone has
a healing, they've

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:90%
got a history of encounters.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was very curious about it.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And after interviewing her
about every aspect of her life,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I finally asked
her about her job.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well,
I'm retired, but I'm

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
very active in social working
and human rights and animal

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:90%
rights.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.207 align:middle line:84%
And that rang a bell for
me because I had just

00:12:41.207 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a gentleman who
worked very hard against racism

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:90%
and he was healed.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize,
looking at my cases,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the people were healed
are doing good work for humanity

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:90%
in some capacity.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a lot of
doctors, nurses, teachers,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
social workers, animal rights
activists, environmentalists,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.428 align:middle line:90%
inventors, police officers.

00:13:06.428 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But who's
doing the healing?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
What type of ET?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I did a whole
statistical study of that,

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was surprised to see it
was mostly Greys, actually.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yes, which often
get a sort of a bad rap.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But no, it was mostly Greys
but definitely human-looking

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
ETs, praying mantis,
all different types,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:90%
strange humanoids.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they doing
this, in your opinion?

00:13:31.747 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Well,
some of the witnesses

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're just
working with the ETs

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and the ETs want to
maintain their health

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.498 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill their mission.

00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
they're good people?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.665 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: It's very
hard to speculate.

00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I try not to speculate
in this field

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
because it can take you
right down a rabbit hole.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
why they're doing

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
it other than to preserve the
best of our genetics, I think.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people who
do have these healings

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
are profoundly psychic,
are very long-lived,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:90%
enjoy excellent health.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:90%
I've noticed that.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I can't say for sure
why other than it's--

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
some feel it's
absolutely altruistic.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So you get sort of a bell
curve of explanations

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%
as to why they're doing it.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is they are, and
it's hard to walk away from it.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been
reports of schoolyard UFO cases

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I became interested
in schoolyard UFO encounters

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:84%
when I heard about the
Ruwa, Zimbabwe case in 1994

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.970 align:middle line:90%
at Ariel Elementary School.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Very famous case.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where they waved
to the kids or something.

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:40.835 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Right.

00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
UFOs landed right next
to the playground.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
60 to 200 kids saw this--

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including
the instructor?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: There was
one instructor, yeah,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:84%
who recently came out and
said that she's had encounters

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
there as well.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Initially, no.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did I know this?

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: [LAUGHS] It's
amazing, they told me.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But I instantly thought of the
Melbourne Westall High School

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that one.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: That occurred in 1966
where, again, UFOs landed next

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to the playground and some
200 to 300 kids and teachers,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:90%
by the way, saw this craft.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a very well-documented
case, probably Australia's most

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
widely-viewed UFO incident.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have pictures of
a case in Broad Haven, Wales,

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:90%
at a schoolyard encounter.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what we're
looking at here, Preston.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah,
this is amazing.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:10%
Another very
well-documented case

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:10%
where all the children
drew exactly what they saw.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same
sort of pattern

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:10%
in these schoolyard cases.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:10%
These UFOs will land right
next to the playground, often

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:10%
in a grove of trees.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And in this one, ETs
came out and several kids

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
saw this, quite a
few, and teachers

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
as well, or school officials,
which is true in about 50%

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:90%
of the cases.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
What's super interesting
about these cases

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is they reach back
all the way to 1950.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
There's one or two really
good solid cases every year.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.293 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: They're
all over the world.

00:16:16.293 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:90%
I documented over 100.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
about these is these

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:90%
are very low-level cases.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
In one-third of these
cases, a full one-third,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:84%
this craft are actually landing
and humanoids are being seen.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
what some of the kids drew.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yes, this is
the Ruwa, Zimbabwe case.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I love to see these
children's drawings

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
because children have no
preconceptions about--

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them had never
even heard of UFOs.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were
all the pictures

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
that the kids did similar?

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yes, they
were very similar.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Not all exactly alike,
which is actually important

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
detail because when
you do investigations

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
into multiple
witness cases, you'll

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
see there's always slight
variations in what people

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
remember and how
they perceived it.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing to see these
incredible similarities.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
These are very long
lasting cases, too.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the ETs, Preston,
leave any physical evidence

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:90%
behind?

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what?

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: There's several
cases involving landing traces.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
That was true at the
Westall High School--

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --burned out landing
traces that we've seen.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Grass will be
crushed or burned or flattened

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Some involve photographs.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
There's at least
two or three cases

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
where UFOs dropped what
we call angel hair.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a cotton candy
spiderweb-like substance

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:84%
which is emitted from refers
in some way we don't fully

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these ETs interact
with people to a point

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
relationship there?

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Sometimes they do.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.777 align:middle line:84%
In a number of these
cases, it's what

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
we would call a close
encounter of the first kind.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:90%
A simple sighting.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: But often,
they will land.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Some people do get
telepathic messages.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
these cases, it's

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of a lifelong
relationship with ETs.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So some of these children end
up having multiple encounters

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an
investigator, as an author,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
what is your overall perspective
on what the heck is going on?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: With these schoolyard
cases, it's pretty clear to me

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that the agenda is one
of a publicity campaign.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
very vigorously

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.438 align:middle line:84%
and in a very clever way trying
to announce their presence.

00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Because they showed themselves.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.063 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get kids involved.

00:18:43.063 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, showing
themselves to kids.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Kids are very impressive.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They soak up knowledge
like a sponge.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And this convinces them from
day one that UFOs are real.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's been very effective.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And what's so amazing
about these cases,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
the schoolyard
cases, is fully half

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of them take place at
elementary schools.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why use kids?

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I think kids
are very impressionable.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Innocent.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, very innocent.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They soak up knowledge
very quickly.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:90%
They're very young.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:84%
These are going to be
the future of our planet.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you get
favorable publicity with kids.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, and it also--

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.243 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you saw.

00:19:25.243 --> 00:19:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah, it slides
under the radar a bit.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were
showing these to adults,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
this might get a lot more
publicity than it does.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you spoken to some
of the parents of the children?

00:19:37.685 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Well,
certainly, yeah.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they say?

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Often, the parents
are skeptical at first.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But realize later on as the
kids grow up that-- because they

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:90%
never retract their stories.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Not one of these kids has
ever said it was a hoax.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about these cases

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is they're almost, as a
rule, multiple witness cases.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:90%
20, 30, 40 kids.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Upwards--

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At a time?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a mass hysteria
syndrome involved here?

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Where--

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.147 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: I don't think so.

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One makes it up
and they all make it up.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I don't think
that that is a possibility.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
These stories are
very consistent.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, in half the cases,
teachers are seeing these.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Teachers who are well educated.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:25.617 align:middle line:90%
Science teachers.

00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
saying the teachers

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.923 align:middle line:84%
of these kids who witnessed
these things, they see it, too.

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they baffled?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: 100%.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Some.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
There is a strong fear
reaction in some cases.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Most, no.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one gentleman at
Whitsitt Elementary School,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:90%
he was the principal.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:90%
He saw it.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:90%
He had flown in World War II.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Was very knowledgeable
about aircraft.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And he would not have the
debunkers coming at him.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Because they did.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.523 align:middle line:90%
They tried to disprove it.

00:20:59.523 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, no,
I know what I saw.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And he had some 60, 70
students to back him up,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.822 align:middle line:90%
as well as another teacher.

00:21:07.822 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
though, most of these

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
are Greys that
people are seeing?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: In these cases,
it's right across the board,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:84%
from tall beings to
short little ones.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Dwarves.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Greys and some.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a
wide, wide variation.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are any of them
human looking, Preston?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yes, which has
profound implications.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The fact that some of these
ETs look just like us.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they us?

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Exactly.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it raises serious
questions about our relationship

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And where do we come from?

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if there are human
looking ETs out there, I mean,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
did we even evolve
here on this planet?

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of contactees
are told, no, we did not.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about that.

00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: Yeah,
I've interviewed

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:90%
many, many contactees.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.892 align:middle line:84%
And some have more
recall than others

00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They think we were
brought here, don't they?

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yes.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
A number that I have met
mentioned the planet Mars.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That, in previous iterations,
we actually lived on Mars,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:90%
millions of years earlier.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, hundreds of thousands.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely have serious
questions about who we are

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and where we came from.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the
drive-in movie encounter.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yes.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I was at my office one day
and a new employee came in.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Claudia.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Found out I was a UFO
researcher and explained

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
how she and her family were
at the Paramount drive-in 1972

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:90%
when a UFO showed up.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Dropped right down
next to the screen,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and it cleared the
theater parking lot.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this is amazing.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People panicked, huh?

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.513 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah.

00:22:50.513 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is an
extraordinary encounter.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
anything like this.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And did a little investigation.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Interviewed her and her mother.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And thought it was
a one-off, unique.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Started to get other cases.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into three cases
in a row doing some research.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I wonder
if this is a thing.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And dug deep, scouring
through archives of newspapers

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and UFO organizations.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got a huge shock when
I found over 100 cases.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over 100?

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Over 100.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we've
got a photo recreation

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of this drive-in
movie encounter.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how accurate
you think it might be.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yes.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:10%
This is one gentleman
I interviewed.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:10%
Scott Santa is his name.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:10%
He's a wonderful gentleman.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.648 align:middle line:10%
And he approved this recreation.

00:23:44.648 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's the movie
they're watching, by the way?

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNETT: You
know, I don't know.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:10%
I looked into that to see
if there was a pattern.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:10%
But it's all different
movies, from "Jurassic Park,"

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:10%
to "The Exorcist," to
"The Simpsons" movie.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you name it.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:10%
"Outlaw Josey Wales."

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't remember the
movie he was watching.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:10%
But it was an
extraordinary encounter,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:10%
because this large boomerang
triangular craft came right

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:10%
over the theater.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that what
we see on the top there?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNETT: Right, exactly.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.910 align:middle line:10%
And he said it was massive.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:10%
It covered not only the screen,
but the entire parking lot.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:10%
So well over a
couple hundred feet.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:10%
And knocked out the movie.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:10%
All the cars, all
the electricity.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:10%
And people jumped
out of their cars,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:10%
were staring up
and looking at it.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:10%
He says his ears popped.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:10%
There was this low
thrumming noise.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:10%
Very massive.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can't make
that stuff up, Preston.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.628 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNETT: You really can't.

00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
picture of an article of one

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:90%
of the encounters as well.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So it has generated
some publicity.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Absolutely.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
In most cases, this really
only got local publicity

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
in the local newspapers.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Rarely did it make
national news.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Or ever really got
onto the TV news.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't we seem to
be getting these kind of cases

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't get the
abduction cases.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't get the fly-bys.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't get that kind
of publicity anymore.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I think the coverup
has been very effective.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a media blackout
on this subject.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the '50s, '60s, '70s,
and even into the '80s, I think

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot more real
research into this subject.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Newspapers absolutely
printed articles

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
on this subject, which we
just don't see anymore.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why,
but there's no doubt

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that this coverup has really
affected our perception

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.087 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:25:43.087 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people-- and
I always ask people

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
when they have an encounter,
did you report this in any way?

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Did you call the
police, the Air Force?

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you call MUFON?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Most will say, no.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
know what MUFON is.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they don't.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: So one-- and I'm
being generous here-- one in 100

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:90%
reports this in any way.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So any numbers as to how
common a encounter is,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:90%
is vastly underestimated.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prince Edward
Island in Canada had a case.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:90%
How significant is that?

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I love that case
because this was the Prince

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Edward Island case.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: This UFO kept
showing up over the theater

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:84%
To the point where
it was so common,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the theater owners decided
that they would actually

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:90%
advertise it in their marquee--

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:90%
"Want to see a UFO?

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Come to our theater."

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great promotion.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Exactly.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.908 align:middle line:84%
And in these cases,
it's very much

00:26:39.908 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:90%
like the schoolyard encounters.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They're very low
level, long-lasting.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
out there in terms

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.698 align:middle line:84%
of the number of witnesses,
because there are--

00:26:48.698 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a
publicity scheme, right?

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: No.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of the theater
goers were like, wow,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:90%
is this special effects?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.008 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: But what's
amazing is in most cases,

00:26:58.008 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
they will hover right above
the screen or to either side,

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
and not just hover.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:84%
They will put on
a show, literally.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
They will turn on their
side, flash their lights.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They'll dart around
for 20 minutes.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:90%
They'll release smaller craft.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
To the point where they
sometimes turn off the movie

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.663 align:middle line:90%
because no one's watching it.

00:27:18.663 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
watching the UFO.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Exactly.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nowadays, we put up
holograms and trick people.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Bakersfield, California
had a case, too, didn't it?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I love the
Bakersfield, California case.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
That was at the
Terrace Drive-In.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think this would
have gotten any attention

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:84%
if there hadn't been military
witnesses in the audience,

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:90%
but there was.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And he called up the
local police station,

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and the sheriff there
ended up coming down

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to the drive-in theater,
the Terrace Drive-In,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and interviewing some 30 people.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There was 100 still
waiting there.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.227 align:middle line:84%
This UFO had come
down, was cylindrical.

00:27:54.227 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
the same kind of UFO

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that these other theaters
are seeing, or different?

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: This is
a cylindrical one.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
So there's variations.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:90%
A lot of your classic saucer.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.483 align:middle line:84%
Some are egg-shaped,
spherical-shaped.

00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so
they're different.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Many different shapes.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Mostly saucer-shaped.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So this one was a little--

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they see occupants?

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: In a few cases, yes.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Not a whole lot,
but it does happen.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They'll see an occupant looking
down through the portal,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:90%
In this case, they didn't.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I love about
this Terrace Drive-In

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
case is, while it was
quite brief and took off,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
the sheriff, Leroy
Hatfield, wrote up a report

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and sent it to Edwards Air Force
Base, where it was picked up

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
by Project Blue Book or the
precursor, Project Grudge, Sign.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote a report
that day marked "action"--

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can see this in
the Blue Book records--

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and sent it off to-- get this--

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
the commanding general of
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Base--

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: --as well
as intelligence--

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the head of intelligence
at Washington, DC,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and Ent Air Force
Base in Colorado,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
where we track all incoming
and outgoing traffic.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So they know about this-- our
governments knew about this--

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
despite all their
accusations or assessments

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that UFO sightings
can be explained

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
as hoaxes, hallucinations,
or misperceptions.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
They knew from the beginning
that this was real, and were

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:90%
taking it very seriously.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.873 align:middle line:90%
I have several cases like that.

00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most
drive-in in theaters

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
have closed over the years.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Technology has turned people
into interests in other ways.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Why drive-in theaters
in those days?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.642 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I really did a lot
of speculation about that.

00:29:45.642 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting is if you

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:84%
look at a drive-in theater
from an aerial perspective,

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.918 align:middle line:84%
you could probably see
these from outer space.

00:29:52.918 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And my initial thought
was, well, perhaps they're

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
interested in these huge
screens, these beams of light,

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:90%
all these cars parked there.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's only, like,
200 cars out there, right--

00:30:02.943 --> 00:30:03.743 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Right.

00:30:03.743 --> 00:30:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --at any given time.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: But I thought, could
they be watching the movie?

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so,
because they're usually

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:90%
hovering above the screen.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I think, it's very much like
the schoolyard encounters.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
They're using it
as an opportunity

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to announce their presence.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they're
practical jokers.

00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: There is--

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're having fun.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.523 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: They do
chase cars down the road

00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and scaring the
daylights out of people.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've seen that happen.

00:30:27.523 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: It's a very unusual
aspect of UFO behavior,

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
where I wonder, sometimes,
are they teenagers

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:90%
piloting these things?

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have anybody been
taken aboard these craft?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I couldn't say in
terms of the drive-in theater

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:90%
cases that, that is a pattern.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There are a few cases where
people didn't remember

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:90%
their encounter until later.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So when someone has amnesia
associated with an encounter,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.295 align:middle line:84%
that's a red flag, that it
could be an onboard experience.

00:30:57.295 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been on a craft?

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I
believe I have, yes.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had one missing
time encounter in 1992,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
where an orb came down
in front of my car,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:90%
and that's the last I remember.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But more recently, I did
have a fully conscious

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
onboard encounter that was
about five minutes long,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
not super long, but it was
the most amazing experience

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they do to you?

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I was
pulled from my bedroom,

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and I suddenly
found myself flying

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.662 align:middle line:84%
through space and into a craft
where I was lying on a table.

00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you go
through your ceiling?

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I don't
really remember that.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I sort of came to
hurdling up towards this--

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.433 align:middle line:84%
through space, is
what I thought.

00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But I instantly knew
what was happening.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I just had an--

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you sure
it wasn't a wild dream?

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.602 align:middle line:90%
You were alert, awake?

00:31:50.602 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: I was fully awake.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely,
100% conscious.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And found myself surrounded by--

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
well, there was some
human-looking people,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:84%
there was a clear
hybrid, and a tall Grey.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:90%
A couple of other ETs.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
There were other
people on board.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying on a table, and
they asked me, am I all right?

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Am I all right?

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I'm absolutely fine."

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
were wearing what?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I don't remember,
what I was wearing.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Presumably--

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever
you went to bed in?

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you were
dressed, right?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: A little bit.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wasn't
really paying attention

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to that because I was so
struck by my surroundings,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
to find myself in the
round room that I've

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
heard so many people
describe, with the rounded

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
walls, and portholes all
around, and very smooth floor.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them,
"Can I go explore?

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And they said, "Certainly."

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I walked over to the
window, and I looked down,

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
Earth far below.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.423 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a very
intense encounter.

00:32:55.423 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the most
compelling contactee cases

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:84%
you've written about
is about Dolly Safran.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have written an
entire book about her called

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:90%
"Symmetry."

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Dolly's with us right now.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Tell us how you two met.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNETT: Yeah.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Dolly reached out to me in
2016, and it became very clear

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to me, pretty quickly,
that she was different

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:90%
from most contactees.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
She overcame her fears
surrounding these encounters.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't having missing time.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
She's what I call a fully
conscious contactee.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I soon realized that
her case was probably

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:36.730 align:middle line:84%
the most extensive I've ever
had the honor to investigate.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:10%
And she later told
me that how she

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:10%
found me was that she was
looking for someone to research

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.590 align:middle line:10%
her case, and was having some
difficulty finding a researcher

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:10%
she really trusted and--

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: --sort of
felt comfortable with.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And talked to her ET contacts
about that, and they said,

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:84%
"Well, there's a gentleman
we'd like you to look into."

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they
gave her my name.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
When she told me
that, I'm like, "Wow.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%
The ET's know about me."

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in the
ET Yellow Pages, right?

00:34:07.927 --> 00:34:09.343 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: But I
had to believe it

00:34:09.343 --> 00:34:10.880 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had
this happen before,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:90%
and it would happen again.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.018 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: So it
became clear to me

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, ET's
do know about me.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They know about all of
us, so I'm nobody special.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, apparently, I was
referred by the ETs themselves.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Dolly, you've had
a long history of ET contact.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.163 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLLY SAFRAN: Yes.

00:34:28.163 --> 00:34:29.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long history.

00:34:29.345 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:84%
When you tell the
story to people

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to tell us in
a moment, do they believe you?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: I would
say 80%, not at all.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that bother you?

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.115 align:middle line:10%
>>SAFRAN: It disappoints me.

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:10%
Is is-- it is what it is,
but it is disappointing.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought by the time
I started speaking out

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that more people would
be more open knowing

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.949 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in the world
today, and they are not.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were you when
the first contact occurred

00:34:59.340 --> 00:34:59.670 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: I was-- my
first real memory,

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I was about 10 months
old in my crib.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 months.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.885 align:middle line:90%
Are you a hybrid baby?

00:35:05.885 --> 00:35:06.885 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: I am a hybrid.

00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:07.685 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:07.685 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yeah.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many more
contacts have you had?

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: How many
more contacts?

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
In the order of thousands,
tens of thousands.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been aboard craft?

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.123 align:middle line:84%
Have you been to other
planetary systems?

00:35:22.123 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes, I have.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want with you?

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
What's their goal?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: I am
fulfilling a hope.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone in this hope.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I am not.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I am one of many
like me, who they

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
hoped would fulfill a
potential, and wake up,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and be able to help assist in
the coming events of our future.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And to help people
understand what's

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:84%
going on amid a
crisis, both socially

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, in our
solar system, as well.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you consider
yourself a human,

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:84%
or do you consider yourself
an extraterrestrial?

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: I am human.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:08.945 align:middle line:84%
I am part tall Grey, and I do
have Nordic bloodlines in me,

00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:09.745 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
blonde hair, right?

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: It could be, yes.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We are all hybrids
here, just so you know.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:90%
We are all part of them.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I learned
from them was that we are them,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:90%
they are us, and we are all one.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:90%
We are all genetically the same.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are your
human parents alive?

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: No.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:90%
They have passed.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.518 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they aware of this
situation when they were alive?

00:36:34.518 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: My father very much
so, and my mother as well, yes.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
And my brother.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they recollect
anything happening to them?

00:36:40.582 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Oh, they did.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
it incessantly.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:90%
My mother especially, yes.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think happened

00:36:45.538 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:90%
prior to your conception?

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: Well, my
father was a contactee,

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know it at
first when I was very young.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
They were dealing with
my abilities very young.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I presented quickly,
and they were just

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.850 align:middle line:90%
trying to get through that.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
My father knew I was
going through this.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:84%
He was aware that I
was being contacted.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:84%
My mother did too, but she
was very, very adverse to it.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:90%
She tried to protect me.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.900 align:middle line:84%
She was-- I wouldn't
call it afraid,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but she just didn't want
her only daughter in this.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
She became a very protective
lioness of a mother for me.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted me to
live a normal life.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the
egg of your mother?

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.036 align:middle line:84%
Are you the reproductive
system of your father?

00:37:30.036 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: I am--

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which of the two,
or maybe a combination?

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: I am genetically
mostly my father.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I have some of my mother, but
I have eight strands of DNA

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:90%
that they can't account for.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're
considered non-human.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
extraterrestrial.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yeah.

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:46.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what they
brought to the table.

00:37:46.948 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
hybrids are there?

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: On this planet?

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: More than I could
possibly imagine myself.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds?

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: I know it's high.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millions?

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Thousands?

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: I would say
at least a million.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people think that
the goal of the hybridization

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:84%
program is to take over planet
Earth at a certain time.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: The goal of
the extraterrestrials

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.043 align:middle line:90%
is not to take over Earth.

00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:84%
They could have done it if
they wanted to a long time ago.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.065 align:middle line:84%
That's a cliché thing to
say, but it's very true.

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
They have intentions toward
us that are mostly parental.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We are-- they are
our progenitors.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:90%
We are from them.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:84%
All the different ethnicities,
we are all part of that,

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:90%
and they have watched over us.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a hard place
to learn to be here.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We're here to grow wise.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We're here to, essentially,
evolve out of this.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a
hard group for them,

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.810 align:middle line:84%
because we're not living up
to our capabilities at all,

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
disconcerting for them.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely disconcerting.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
They are not
punitive in any way.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:84%
They have never shown
that to anybody here.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no history
of it whatsoever.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:84%
They have tried to show
us what we are potentially

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
going to do to ourselves
that's that dangerous.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%
They have shut down
nuclear facilities,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they've shut down silos,
they have shown themselves

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:90%
to give a very clear message.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what we are
doing is going to hurt us,

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and we need to think
about stopping.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got this
human blood in you--

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --which means you're
subjected to human conditions

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:90%
and diseases.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I understand,
you're a type-I diabetic.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yes.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.900 align:middle line:90%
That's an anomaly of my birth.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't they
solve this for you?

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they fix it?

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: It is at
the chromosomal level.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And once your pancreas--
without getting a new pancreas,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and they won't do that
because my life is

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.325 align:middle line:90%
pretty karmic at the same time.

00:39:47.325 --> 00:39:49.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm learning
lessons here with everybody,

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
state of my being.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I accept it for what
it is, and I live with it.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:84%

I asked for it.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.125 align:middle line:90%
We're getting it.

00:40:13.125 --> 00:40:14.375 align:middle line:90%

Yep, there he is.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.645 align:middle line:90%
He's dropping drones.

00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the guys.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:49.556 align:middle line:90%

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.585 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
charge up tonight.

00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be back.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How high
up was that object?

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: It was
about 3,000 feet up.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: No.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It was to protect my
camera from being in--

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:84%
their electromagnetic pulse
from their Graviton emitters

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.360 align:middle line:84%
would knock out any
digital electricity--

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.130 align:middle line:84%
it would have
blanketed-- knocked

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.660 align:middle line:84%
out the whole area
where we were in.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So he was holding his line
of sight in the transmitters

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:84%
away from me so that I
could get him on film.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:90%
This was planned.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
one object or many?

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: There
were three there.

00:42:01.545 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The one dropping drones,
then the other one.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Yeah.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then that one, that's the
one that was dropping drones.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.397 align:middle line:84%
You can see the drone
at the end of him.

00:42:09.397 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And those are four
drones coming down.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.970 align:middle line:84%
They're in a stasis until
they are away from the craft,

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and then they power up, and
they fly away on their own.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
does this take you?

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What happens next with
you in this situation?

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: Basically,
I decided to come out.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I wanted, very much, for
everybody to know the truth.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The misinformation on
this planet is rampant,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.445 align:middle line:84%
and it's crazy, and I
wanted to tell the truth.

00:42:39.445 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
After about six, eight, or nine
months of briefing me on what

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to expect, they turned
me loose so I could.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I have-- I am an
actual pilot for them,

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and I made the decision to
ground myself to do this.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a hard decision,
because right now they

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
are physically not on this
solar system with us at all.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:90%
They bugged out.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
they seem to get

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.635 align:middle line:90%
involved in what we're doing?

00:43:07.635 --> 00:43:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
wars on this planet.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't stop it.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: Right.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have chaos.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't stop it.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.490 align:middle line:90%
They test it.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:84%
As you were talking earlier,
they will go over nuke sites

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and shut it down for
a moment, but then it

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.380 align:middle line:90%
comes right back up online.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they get involved?

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SAFRAN: Because we
caused our own problems,

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and they cannot be
the ones to fix us.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:84%
We are unteachable
at this point.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
We are so violent,
and so negative,

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and so afraid that they
couldn't reach us if they tried.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
destroy us to get rid

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.627 align:middle line:90%
of the evil portion of this?

00:43:44.627 --> 00:43:45.427 align:middle line:90%
>>SAFRAN: No.

00:43:45.427 --> 00:43:47.010 align:middle line:84%
That has never been
their intention.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:84%
They are not going to
destroy their own children.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Preston, what
do you think of this?

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNETT: I agree
with what she's saying.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Dolly's case
is different from most

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
because she does have
photographic evidence.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.340 align:middle line:84%
She's got supporting
witnesses, medical evidence.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And what she's saying
is what I've heard

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:90%
from so many other contactees.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
We are you, you
are us, we are one.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:10%
They cannot step in and
solve all our problems.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.670 align:middle line:10%
It's up to us.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.670 align:middle line:10%
All of these things she's
saying I've heard before,

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.130 align:middle line:10%
mostly piecemeal, but
she's been able to fill

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of the blanks and
answer a lot of the questions

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.730 align:middle line:10%
I myself had about what
ET contact is all about.

constantly, Dolly,

getting new answers
to questions you have?

>>SAFRAN: I've spent a
lifetime learning with them,

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.540 align:middle line:10%
so most of my
questions are answered.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:84%
The questions I ask now are,
how do I reach people here?

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:90%
How do I make sense to them?

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:90%

They care about
what they're doing.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.070 align:middle line:84%
One is a UFO investigator,
the other is an ET contactee,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and one day, it will
affect all of us.
