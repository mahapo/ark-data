00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Debbie Solaris is with us, an ET
contactee, galactic historian,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:10%
and interdimensional traveler.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Debbie is a highly adept
reader of the Akashic Records

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and receives downloads of
galactic historical information,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
as well as universal
spiritual knowledge.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Wow, Debbie.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBBIE SOLARIS:
I'm doing great.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.015 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me back.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a joy to be here with you.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the ET
contactee thing happen?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: That happened
a few years ago in 2012.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And that was an experience that
completely changed my life,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:10%
changed the whole
trajectory of who I am.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:10%
And actually, in a kind
of a roundabout way,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:10%
led to me doing what
I do today, which

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
is reading the Akashic
Records and talking

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:10%
about galactic history.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it unexpected for
you, or did you summon them up?

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, I
didn't summon them up.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Maybe in a way, but
no, I didn't summon it at all.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It totally happened
pretty randomly.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
elemental beings?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Elemental beings
are nature spirits that are

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:90%
associated with--

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
they're associated with
spiritual essence elements.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So the four elements that
are the most prevalent

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
are fire, air, water,
and earth, which

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
are the elements that make
up our physical reality.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And these are actual
beings that are

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
associated with these elements.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
you have a fire

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.923 align:middle line:84%
being that runs around
and looks like a torch?

00:01:56.923 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It doesn't
look quite like a torch.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there are
fire elementals,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and they're called salamanders.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they look
like balls of light.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Other times they might
look like lizard-like

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:90%
so just like the salamander.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And those are associated
with the fire element.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We have beings that are
associated with quite

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:90%
a few different elements.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other examples
would you be able to give us?

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, I can give
you quite a few actually.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say the biggest group
would be the Earth elementals.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So that would be beings like
gnomes and pixies and pygmies

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.265 align:middle line:90%
and dryads and--

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Leprechauns.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: --Leprechauns.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they fall under the
Earth elemental group.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And these are beings that
are associated with taking

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
care of the physical world.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the
trees and the plants

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and the rocks and the
minerals and gems.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Pygmies are
associated with gems.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So these are beings
that are actually real.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
they're made up,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but my belief is a
lot of our mythology

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and our stories
are based in truth.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so these are beings that
people have had interactions

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
with for thousands of years.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They either have
far fetched imaginations

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or exactly what you just said,
based on some form of truth,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
something happened
that these people saw.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would say children
mostly because children,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:90%
they're higher vibrational.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So children will oftentimes
see beings like this,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.285 align:middle line:84%
and they would
interact with them.

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell
their parents,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.743 align:middle line:84%
and their parents think
they're just making it up.

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But these beings are real, and
they're part of our reality.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason why a lot of
adults don't see them

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is because they do exist in the
fourth and the fifth dimension.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And so unless you're
really sensitive

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're tuned into
those vibrations,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
you're not likely to see
them unless you're really

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
tuning into that.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
let us see them,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.957 align:middle line:84%
or do we have to be
tuned up to see them?

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I believe
we have to be tuned up.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really work
on our vibrational state.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways to
connect with elementals.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this
recently in a training

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I did where basically, you
can just sit down in nature

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and bathe yourself
in this golden light,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
so you just imagine this
golden light around you.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can call out to them,
and they will come and visit.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it could be any
type of elemental.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It could be an Earth elemental.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be a fire or
water or air elementals.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
People seem to really love
connecting with the air, which

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
are the fairies and the sylphs,
or the water elementals, which

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.585 align:middle line:90%
are mermaids and undines.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got a picture
of an elemental being.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's have you describe
what we're looking at.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we've got some--

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:90%
what is this, Debbie?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: These are
the four elements,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and the beings that represent
each of the four elements.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:10%
So on your left there,
there's a really nice

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:10%
little representation
of a gnome,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.125 align:middle line:10%
which is a representation
of an earth elemental.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Looks like an elf.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Yep.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, they are.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:10%
Elves fall into
that category too.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And those are
similar to the gnomes

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that people have in the
little statues in their yards

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:10%
But they're actually
amazing little beings

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:10%
because they do take care
of our physical world.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:10%
The one that's next
to it is an example

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:10%
of an undine or a mermaid, which
is part of the water elemental.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So undines
take care of the water.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They care for beings
that live in the water.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:10%
So that would be our fish and
other crustaceans and beings

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:10%
and even including the mammals
such as dolphins and whales.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:10%
And then we were talking
about fire elementals.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:10%
The next one beside
that to the right

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
is a salamander type of being
that is a representation

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:10%
of a fire elemental.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:10%
And then the one on the
right is an air elemental.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:10%
So that would be
sylph or a fairy.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
see fairies as being

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:10%
teeny tiny like Tinkerbell
or her friends in Disney,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:10%
but fairies can
come in all sizes,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:10%
so they're not
necessarily teeny tiny.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now those
four, are they the same

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:90%
all the time or they change?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They can change.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these beings
are shapeshifters.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they're more
in their, I would say,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:90%
ethereal essence.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So they might look sparkly
like sparkly lights or an orb.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people see
orbs and that might be

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:90%
a representation of elementals.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But they can oftentimes
appear more humanoid.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So they might appear to
us looking more humanoid

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.685 align:middle line:84%
because that's what we can
associate with them with.

00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:17.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
always nice, benevolent?

00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, I would say
they take on whatever energy

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing
at the moment.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they might be
mischievous or even naughty

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.405 align:middle line:90%
to a certain extent.

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:33.238 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the little
gnome looks like he

00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:34.448 align:middle line:90%
could be a little trickster.

00:07:34.448 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, yeah.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of clients,
Akashic clients,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
who throughout the years have
asked me about elementals.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So I've done quite a
bit of work regarding

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.085 align:middle line:84%
elemental galactic history
and where they came from.

00:07:52.085 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not so sure I want
to go swimming with the mermaid

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.327 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, really?

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I love mermaids.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought they'd
keep you under water.

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, they
wouldn't do that.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:90%
The mermaids are--

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.187 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you sure?

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, mermaids
are very loving beings,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're bad to them, they
might do something naughty back.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
and a lot of my clients

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
feel a real connection
with mermaids.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are any of
those extraterrestrial?

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, actually,
I would say, pretty much

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
all of them originated
from other star systems

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they just
brought here or what?

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think there was
quite a bit of migration that

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:90%
occurred throughout history.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
So what I saw in
the Akashic Records

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:84%
is that originally, these
elemental beings originated

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
from Andromeda Galaxy.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So our Milky Way was birthed
from the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: When the
Milky Way was created,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:90%
these beings that originated--

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I call them the frequency
management group.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically
frequency beings,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:90%
so they maintain frequency.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So these beings came in
through the Antares Stargate,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and they started
settling in Lyra

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
because that was the first
physical reality that

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
was created in the Milky Way.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So there was the first physical
worlds, physical environments.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what these
beings did was that they

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
were maintaining the physical
environments of the Lyran

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
physical reality

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:90%
we had here in the Milky Way.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they
weren't teeny tiny.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
They weren't little.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
They were actually quite tall.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Taller than humans?

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, very much so.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:84%
They had kind of a crystalline,
humanoid body shape,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
but they were very, very
tall during that time.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who coined the
phrase "elemental beings?"

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Actually, a Swiss
physician and philosopher

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
named Paracelsus
coined the term.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the 1600s.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So this was talked
about even back then.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must have
witnessed these in order

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:90%
to coin the term?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I think he did.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I think he was the one that--
the first person to really--

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or one of the very first people
to talk about elementals.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And he really did
a lot of research.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And he was a scientist as well.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So he kind of took a
scientific approach to it.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
Lyran-Draconian war.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I'll talk about it
in terms of the elementals.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, so
the elemental beings

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
were living in these beautiful
Lyran paradise planets

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
like the other beings that
lived on these planets.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And during the wars, it
depended on what planet

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
they were on, but the ones that
lived in Avalon, because Avalon

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:84%
was the first planet that was
attacked, most of them perished.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw in the
records is that some of them

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
survived because they were
hiding out in the plants.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Lyran farmers
who were evacuated

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:90%
took the plants with them.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So I know that sounds
like a crazy story,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
but this was something I
downloaded from the records.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh,
that makes sense.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So most of the Avalon
survivors ended up

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleiades and the
Hyades and Aldebaran.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So in those systems, we see
quite a few Earth elemental

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We see quite a few of the
water and air elementals

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
in Sirius and Andromeda
constellations.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So those beings did survive
the wars, ended up mostly--

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Sirius was like a hodgepodge
of a lot of different types

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
of elementals.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It was like "Lord of
the Rings" in Sirius.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- it was a pretty
interesting star system.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda too had a lot
of interesting beings.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They actually had quite
a few water elementals.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So they have Andromedan
mermaids, as well as

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Sirian mermaids.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So these beings they
just expanded out

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
into the galaxy
like humanoids did.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So when humanoids
eventually arrived,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
these humanoid races
arrived on Earth,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
they brought elemental
beings with them,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have
elementals here on Earth today.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they accept
God as their Supreme being?

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, I
do believe they do.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I do believe all
benevolent races are

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
connected with source and
the divine intelligence

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that we call God.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
mermaids themselves,

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:90%
how were they created?

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My
understanding with mermaids

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is they started off
as an elemental.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And just like humans they
evolved from the Lyra system

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and the Andromeda galaxy too.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few of them
ended up in Sirius.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And so these beings,
a lot of them

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the
star system of Sirius B.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my clients have had
memories of swimming in water,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
or having a fishtail,
or being a mermaid,

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are associated
with Sirius B. These beings

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.177 align:middle line:84%
actually visited Earth after a
time and they interacted with--

00:13:27.177 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they get
here, in a water bubble?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know, I
think maybe starship, maybe

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:90%
a water bubble.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A tank in a craft?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I don't know.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But they were
amphibious, though.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think they were able
to be on land for a time,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
but they had to be
connected with water.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.426 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't have legs.

00:13:44.426 --> 00:13:45.343 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They don't.

00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:46.545 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flop around.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: --they
flop around, I guess.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But they ended up visiting
the Dogons tribes in Africa.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Dogon actually,
had a lot of information

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
about Sirius A and B that even
scientists didn't know about

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:90%
until quite a time later.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until we had
the modern telescope.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
an amazing story.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That is
an amazing story.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I have great respect
for the Dogon.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And they got a
lot of information

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
from these beings that
used to visit them.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
came from Sirius B,

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and they were called the Nommo.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Nommo were these fish
people, as they called them.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
beautiful-looking mermaids

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:90%
like Ariel in the Disney movies.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
These beings were
quite fishy looking.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But they were
intelligent beings,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
communicate with the Dogon.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
asked the Dogon

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
where they got this
information, they did this.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I know.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.342 align:middle line:90%
I just love that story.

00:14:51.342 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I love to learn about
races of humans or people

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
or tribes that still have a
connection with the star people.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon was one of them and
a lot of Native American tribes

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.433 align:middle line:84%
were also very connected
with the star people.

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
so much going on,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Debbie, that we
don't know about.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Right.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, we have a
picture here of a mermaid.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
How are the mermaids connected
to the ancient civilizations

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, Pompeii,
Egypt and Lemuria?

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a mermaid.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.017 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: That's a mermaid.

00:15:25.017 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No legs,
just flopping around.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That's actually
an AI depiction of a being

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of
people know as Isis.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
So Isis was an Egyptian goddess.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
She was married to Osiris, and
she was the mother of Horus

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
who was the hawk-headed god
that represented the sun along

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:90%
with Ra.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually
considered-- or actually

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:55.618 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit depicted in Egyptian
art as having a fishtail.

00:15:55.618 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
because I just

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
mentioned just a few minutes
ago that these aquatic beings

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
originated from Sirius.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And Isis was also
associated with Sirius.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
She was part of
the Sirian triad,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Osiris and Horus
being the other parts.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So she's here
represented as a mermaid

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
because she originated
from Sirius B.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They obviously can
stay outside of the water

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:84%
for some period
of time, at least.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, they're
amphibian beings,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
so they do have the
capacity to be out of water,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
but they do have to stay
connected with water.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were
brought here for what purpose?

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Actually,
I do believe

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that Osiris and
Isis, these beings,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:84%
were actually extraterrestrial
beings from Sirius.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they came here to
teach humans about--

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
live in the ocean.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.453 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
they do live in the--

00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:90%
at least, Isis did.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Osiris maybe not so much, but.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
But yes, she is depicted as
a mermaid a lot of times.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And in other depictions
she has wings.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.103 align:middle line:84%
So, like I said,
they're shapeshifters.

00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
was their tie-in

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantis and Lemuria
and Egypt and Pompeii?

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, there
is a belief out there

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that mermaids were
very prevalent

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in these civilizations,
particularly

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis and Lemuria
but also Egypt.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:31.358 align:middle line:84%
And they even said there
was mermaids in Pompeii.

00:17:31.358 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
still getting reports

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of mermaids from sailors?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You know what?

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't think--

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not like we used to.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.115 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: --not
like we used to.

00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I think these beings they don't
interact with humans nowadays

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
like they used to
in ancient times.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I think because the
consciousness has shifted

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and changed, and a lot of people
don't believe in them anymore.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So they pretty much stay away
unless you're super sensitive,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.235 align:middle line:84%
and you're tuned
into their frequency.

00:18:01.235 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
elemental beings

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
like the mermaids from Andromeda
different from the ones

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:90%
from the Sirian star system?

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I
do believe they are.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The Andromeda mermaids are
more like spirit mermaids.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
that are depicted--

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
they're very beautiful.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
They have the long
flowing hair that we all

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:90%
associate with mermaids.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I think we get
our depiction of mermaids from.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's more from
the Andromedan version.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
The Sirian mermaids are a
little more fishy looking,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
so they're not super
beautiful by Earth standards.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they magical?

00:18:38.045 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe in magic, yeah.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do for us?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They pretty much
maintain the water frequency.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So they have a water
management system.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So they watch out over
the water environment

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and the water beings that
live within the environment.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't Darrel Hannah
play a mermaid in a movie?

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
she did at "Splash."

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was a great movie.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With that little
sound she made [VOCALIZES]

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
I love that movie.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
based on reality?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Some of
it might be, yeah.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not all of it.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates
you about all this, Debbie?

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.445 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
the thing that

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
fascinates me the
most about elementals

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is how they interplay
with our world,

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and how they're part of
the frequency management

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
of our physical reality.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I also love how we're all
connected to them in some way.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I've done thousands of Akashic
readings, and many of my clients

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
have been very fascinated
with certain elemental beings.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to go on a
journey in the Akashic Records

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to see these beings.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.543 align:middle line:84%
And the more I found
out about them--

00:19:57.543 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't
one of those kids

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:90%
that grew up loving fairies--

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
but the more I found
out about these beings,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.617 align:middle line:84%
the more I have a great
respect and love for them.

00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were witnessed by
a lot of people, weren't they?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They were, yeah.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the people
know what they were seeing?

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think some people
did probably in the past.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
We hear of a lot of
Druidic practices

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
where they interacted with
these elementals quite a bit.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a lot of
people don't realize this,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
but dragon beings are
also an elemental being.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Dragons are the few
elementals that--

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about werewolves?

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Werewolves,
not so much.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't consider them.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Mermaids, yes.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Phoenixes and unicorns, yes.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Dragons actually encompass
all the elements.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're one of those few
beings that aren't associated

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:90%
just with one element.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we'll
come back a little bit

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
later in the program to talk
about dragons because they're

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:90%
fascinating, indeed.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the four elements
that you talk about,

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
are there any more
than the four?

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Dragons
actually encompass metal.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So we do see some metal
dragons and ice dragons.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by metal?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Like metal.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Like a mineral.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Like a metal dragon.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Elements.

00:21:26.627 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Elements, yeah.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So any element-- dragons
are one of those few

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:90%
that encompasses all of them.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all on
planet Earth right now?

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think a lot of
them are in the spiritual realm,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
but there are a few that are
still in the elemental realm.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So I would say yes
and no to that.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen
any of these beings?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I have in
the Akashic Records.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I have not seen them in-person.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean you've seen them

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
in the Akashic Records?

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I've seen
them through my journeys

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
Akashic Records.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So opening
up that book, right?

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Right, yeah.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
seen all four of them?

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.786 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I've seen
quite a variety of them.

00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the four
elements, the beings,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
which one would you like
to be associated with?

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: I think
I love all of them.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:10%
But, I think, if
I had to choose,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:10%
I would choose
the air elementals

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:10%
because they're the
highest vibrational.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have another picture
for you to describe for us.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love these
pictures, the artworks.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
there's Paracelsus,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
a depiction of the Swiss
philosopher I was telling you

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:90%
about earlier.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is Paracelsus who was
the first one who described

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:90%
these different elementals.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And around him is depictions
of the four elements

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that he talked about.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So on the upper left, we have an
example of an earth elemental,

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:90%
which is a gnome.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And then on the upper right,
we have an air elemental

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.415 align:middle line:90%
that is a sylph or a fairy.

00:23:10.415 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A fairy.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And then,
on the bottom left,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:84%
we have the undine, which
is associated with water.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the beautiful
salamander to the bottom right.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a fire elemental
representation.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
people think of this guy

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.973 align:middle line:84%
during this era talking
about stuff like this?

00:23:28.973 --> 00:23:30.015 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You know what?

00:23:30.015 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they believe him?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
He probably had a hard
time during that time.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
These weren't concepts that were
readily accepted during the time

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:90%
that he was talking about them.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think he
was well respected

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:90%
because he was a scientist.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't just work
with elemental beings,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
he also worked
within the elements.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So, I think, to a certain
extent he was probably

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:84%
very well respected, but he had
some really out there ideas.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what are
nature spirits compared

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.933 align:middle line:90%
to elemental beings?

00:24:03.933 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They're
the same thing.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK just a
different phrase?

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.862 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:07.862 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they each
have a specific role?

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, they
maintain the frequency

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of that particular element.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So elementals cannot
switch elements.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So once they're associated
with a certain element, that's

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:90%
the element they stick with.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a fire elemental,
you're always a fire elemental.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're shapeshifters, but
they cannot change elements.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they evil at all?

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, I don't
believe they are.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they lean towards
the positive polarity.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll take another look
at another picture here, Debbie.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Soon as
we make the change.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Gnomes.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Gnomes, yeah.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, gnomes those were very
prevalent in the Pleiades

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.668 align:middle line:10%
and actually here
on Earth as well.

00:24:59.668 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Looks like
one of Santa's helpers.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, it sure does.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I love this image.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:10%
It reminds me of
the garden gnomes,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:10%
a lot of those little
statues like we

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.485 align:middle line:10%
like to have in our gardens.

00:25:11.485 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:10%
But they come in all
shapes and sizes.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:10%
Some look more plant-like,
some are large, some are small.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:10%
So elementals come in all sizes.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:10%
But gnomes particularly take
care of the earth environment.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:10%
So they're associated
with rocks and the earth

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.463 align:middle line:10%
and trees and minerals and gems.

00:25:34.463 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's got a
mustache bigger than I do.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, he sure does.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take another
look at a different picture.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Those are undines.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:10%
So those are the mermaids and
the water sprites and naiads.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So those beings are
associated with water,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:10%
and they take care
of the water beings.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:10%
So they take care of the
fish and other beings

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:10%
that live in the ocean.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They also take
care of humans too.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:10%
The undines in particular are
very emotional, very loving,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:10%
friendly beings.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:10%
So probably some of
the stories we've

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:10%
heard from sailors
interacting with these beings

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:10%
were because they were trying
to help them to some extent.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, next one.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: These beings probably
don't have as much interaction

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:10%
with humans, but this is an
example of a salamander, which

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:10%
is a fire elemental being.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And salamanders are
associated with fire.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:10%
So they actually taught
the Lyran humanoids

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:10%
how to use fire, which the Lyran
humanoids brought to Earth.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:10%
So there's a story about
Prometheus in Greek mythology.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:10%
I sometimes wonder if he was a
Lyran humanoid visiting Earth

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:10%
and bringing fire to Earth.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've caught a lot of
salamanders in my life, Debbie,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.403 align:middle line:84%
but I've never
found one like that.

00:27:00.403 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, me neither.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, me neither.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, this is kind of
a stylized humanoid version

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.545 align:middle line:10%
of one, for sure.

00:27:08.545 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:10%
OK, another picture.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: This is
the group that I

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:10%
think a lot of people
love and that's

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:10%
the fairies and the sylphs.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:22.785 align:middle line:10%
So these beings actually are the
guardian spirits for animals.

00:27:22.785 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:10%


00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:10%
So you know how humans
we have guardian angels,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:10%
they're the guardian
angels for animals.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:10%
So they take care of
the animal kingdom.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.877 align:middle line:10%
And they also can
help us heal as well.

00:27:37.877 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they magical?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:10%
I have great love for
the air elementals.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.215 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where do they live?

00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: They just
live in our environment.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:90%
So they live amongst the nature.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a
reason why a lot of us

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:10%
feel very connected with
nature because we feel

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:10%
a connection with these beings.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:10%
And it brings us back to
maybe past lives where we had

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:10%
more interactions with them.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:10%
And some of my
clients have even had

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:10%
incarnations as these beings.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.915 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are the four
royal stars of the Zodiac?

00:28:10.915 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, that's a
topic I just absolutely love.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for bringing
that up, George.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I love talking about
the four royal stars.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:10%
So the four royal
stars are the stars

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:10%
that are the major stars
within the elemental kingdom

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:10%
but also within
our Zodiac wheel.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.430 align:middle line:10%
So they're the stars that
are in the four fixed

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:10%
signs, which is water.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:10%
Water is associated
with Scorpio.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Fire is associated with Leo.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:10%
Air is associated with Aquarius.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:10%
And earth is
associated with Taurus.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So the elements are associated
also within the astronomy

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:90%
and astrology.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:10%
So earth elementals
are particularly

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:10%
connected with Taurus.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:10%
And the Pleiades is
located within Taurus,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:10%
which is pretty fascinating
because there was a lot of Earth

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:10%
elemental beings that
came from this system,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:10%
particularly Aldebaran,
Pleiades, and Hyades.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, the royal star of
Aldebaran is associated

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:10%
with Archangel Michael.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:10%
Water elementals are
associated with Scorpio

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:10%
which is Antares, which is the
biggest star in the Scorpio

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:10%
constellation.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
That's associated with
Archangel Phanuel.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And we also see water
elementals associated

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:90%
with Sirius and Andromeda.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:10%
Fire elementals are mainly
associated with Leo, which

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Regulus is the major star.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Very connected with
archangel Raphael,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:10%
but there's also
fire elementals that

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:10%
are aligned with the
constellation of Draco.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And then the last but not
least is the air elementals

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:10%
that's Aquarius, which is
the star called Formalhaut

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:10%
which is associated
with Archangel Gabriel.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:10%
But these beings
are also associated

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:10%
with Lyra and Andromeda.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what is the
significance of this, Debbie?

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The
significance of this is--

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.575 align:middle line:84%
and this is just my galactic
historian approach to it.

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:11.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: But
these are the stars.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:10%
So the Zodiac wheel is kind of
like the backbone of our galaxy.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:10%
So these are the stars
that I call stability stars

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.050 align:middle line:10%
because they create a
stability within the Milky Way.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:10%
And when the physical reality
was created in this galaxy,

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:10%
these were the stars
that were created

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:10%
to hold these four elements.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who came up
with these concepts?

00:30:41.318 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: I think
these were concepts that

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.460 align:middle line:10%
were talked about in antiquity.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these were talked about
since the Egyptian mystery

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.135 align:middle line:10%
schools and Sumeria
and even beyond.

00:30:52.135 --> 00:30:54.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They really had some
amazing knowledge of the past,

00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They did.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they had amazing knowledge
of astronomy, for sure.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have any of these
elemental beings, fire, earth,

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.180 align:middle line:84%
water, air ever
hurt a human being?

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, they interact
with us quite a bit.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever hurt them?

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Ever hurt
them, I think if they

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:90%
deserved it, yeah, sure.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said, they
can be mischievous at times.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think if they
were hurting somebody,

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
it was probably in
self-defense or because there

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:90%
was a bigger reason to do so.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, where would
one find these elements?

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would
say mainly in nature.

00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just go out in the
woods and look for them?

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.922 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: You can just
go out in the woods

00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and meditate and
connect with them.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unicorns, where do
they come into this picture?

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of
people love unicorns,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and unicorns have been
depicted throughout history.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one of those
long-standing beings

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:84%
that people feel a very
deep connection with.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.740 align:middle line:84%
My understanding with
the unicorn energy

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
is that it originated from Lyra.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was a ninth
dimensional elemental being

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that came from
the Lyran Stargate

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and came here to Earth to assist
with the frequencies here.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.890 align:middle line:84%
These beings represent
Christ consciousness.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.600 align:middle line:90%
So they are very pure hearted.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't see unicorns so much
anymore because unicorns--

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness has changed.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
People don't believe
in them anymore.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
real or a myth?

00:32:36.853 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I believe
they're real.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I do believe they're real.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They just exist in a
different dimension.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember, there
was a song about a unicorn?

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
I think so, yeah.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (SINGING) There were
green alligators and long-necked

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:90%
geese...

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:90%
It just went on but--

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:90%
something about a unicorn.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, unicorns have been--

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:84%
you see it a lot in depictions,
I would say, particularly

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But they've been depicted
throughout history.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's like if you keep
seeing the same images over

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and over again, I don't
believe they're made up.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I do believe they're
based in reality.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned dragons
earlier in the program.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.362 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what you
call salamanders or are

00:33:22.362 --> 00:33:23.210 align:middle line:90%
they separate?

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They're kind of
separate from salamanders.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Dragons are in a
category all of their own

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because they encompass
all of the elements.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fire breathers.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, they're very
much connected with fire.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But there's water dragons.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.400 align:middle line:84%
There's Earth
dragons, ice dragons.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So they can encompass all
different types of elements.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they fly?

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, they do fly.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.508 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they do have wings.

00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to them?

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think just
like other elementals they

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:90%
shifted into higher dimensions.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't interact
with humans as much

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.240 align:middle line:90%
as they used to in the past.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Lots of different
civilizations have

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:84%
had depictions of dragons,
Chinese, the Celtics,

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and even Mayan
civilizations they've all

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:90%
had their versions of dragons.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it's
like if you're

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing these beings in
different civilizations,

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.860 align:middle line:84%
there must be some
truth to them.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But no, dragons exist
in the higher realms.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They're still here, but they're
just not in the 3D reality.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some dragons have
been slaughtered by humans.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think just like
a lot of different beings,

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:84%
they've been maligned just like
cats were back in the Middle

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Ages or other types of beings.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been maligned
for various reasons.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe dragons
are necessarily evil.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I do think they're more
of a neutral polarity.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So they can shift polarity, I
guess, according to their whim.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know,
they might have

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:84%
had their reasons for
doing harm to humans,

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:90%
and humans retaliated.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.985 align:middle line:84%
So there's many reasons why they
might have been slaughtered.

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
ancients, there's

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
pictures of people sitting on
dragons while they were flying.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:84%
People have had interactions
with them in the past.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They were considered
to be great teachers,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
particularly in Chinese culture
but even in other cultures they

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:90%
were considered to be teachers.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't there a dragon
called the Komodo dragon?

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That's a lizard,
a very large lizard.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that actually
exists in real life.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it an
offshoot of a real dragon?

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Possibly.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Or it might have been an
offshoot of reptilian genetics,

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.310 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the phoenix.

00:36:01.643 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The phoenix
is an elemental

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
being very much associated
with the fire element.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And the phoenix represents an
energy that rebirths itself.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of mythology and a lot
of spiritual schools of thought

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:90%
have phoenix representation.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So even the Egyptians
had phoenixes.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So this was a being that
consumed itself in fire

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.930 align:middle line:90%
but then got reborn.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of Christian
belief around maybe Jesus being

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
a representation
of a phoenix energy

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and other types of
beings that might

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
be connected with this
energy, maybe even

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Horus in Egyptian mythology.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.473 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
Horus had a bird head.

00:36:52.473 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, so there might
be some correlation with that.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, in your client
sessions and past sessions,

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
were many of the clients
elementals in their past lives?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Quite a
few of them, actually.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say every
single one of them,

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:84%
but I've had a few
clients who have

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
had past lives as elemental
beings, mostly the water and air

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
but even some that have been
connected with the earth element

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and fire element.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
through reincarnation?

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we're
multi-dimensional beings,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and we have varying levels
of existence and multiple

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of us might
have had past lives

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
as animals or as
different types of beings,

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily always human.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't hear much
about the elemental beings

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't teach it in school.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No,
they don't, really.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an
impact today at all?

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I think
people have grown away

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
from the connection
with elementals, which

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is a shame because a
lot of our history we've

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:84%
had very much a closer
connection in past history

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:90%
with elemental beings.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we've become very
disconnected from nature

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:90%
and from Earth reality.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So I do think it has a negative
impact in the sense that we

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:84%
don't have that deep spiritual
connection with our planet

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:90%
like we used to in the past.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you have been
an elemental in a past life?

00:38:29.255 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I wouldn't
be surprised.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the four
what might you have been?

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Probably water or
air I would guess.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember past lives
in Lyra, so it's very possible.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our producer,
Tom, was a gnome.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
If he is, he's a
really cute gnome.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.600 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you know
that somebody was an elemental?

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I have
clients who really embody

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
a lot of elemental energy.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And the way you can tell
is they're very super

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.920 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, they don't
like loud noises,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:90%
or they like being in nature.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know that describes
probably a lot of us,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:30.020 align:middle line:84%
but they have a luminous quality
to their skin and their eyes.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And they might have very fluid
movements, very refined hands

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:90%
and feet.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So I do have some
clients that embody

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.947 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this kind of energy.

00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important for
soul evolution to reconnect

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.760 align:middle line:90%
with the elemental?

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would
say it's because we've

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:90%
come here to save this planet.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So we've come here to help Earth
evolve to the fifth dimension.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And part of our evolution is
to reconnect with these beings

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become the
true caretakers of the Earth

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:90%
like we were supposed to.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We've become so
distracted with technology

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and our day-to-day lives that
we've forgotten our connection

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
with the environment.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of our journey back
towards the fifth dimension,

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe
Earth at one time

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
was a fifth
dimensional planet, is

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with these beings
and work alongside with them

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to bring Earth
back to its glory.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're teaching
about elementals

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and their galactic
history now, aren't you?

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got a
trailer for your webinar

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that is absolutely fantastic.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Thank you.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Oftentimes, when doing a
galactic Akashic reading,

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:10%
I will encounter clients who
have had close connections

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:10%
with personal guides,
or may have even

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:10%
had past lives incarnating
as elemental beings.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the beings we all
fondly know today as

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:84%
fairies, gnomes, dwarves,
pixies, brownies, mermaids,

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%
little people.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:10%
Most people associate
these beings

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:10%
as being connected
to planet Earth,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.610 align:middle line:10%
but there are many elementals
that reside in other star

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.650 align:middle line:10%
systems too.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:10%
The first elementals
in this galaxy

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:10%
incarnated into physical form
in the Lyra constellation,

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:10%
most notably in the Avyon,
Avalon, and Bila planets.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Their main role on
the Lyran planets

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:10%
was to maintain the energetic
frequencies needed to sustain

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:10%
the physical realities there.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Mermaids in galactic
history are mostly

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:10%
associated with the
Sirius B system,

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:10%
but there were also
mermaid like beings

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.450 align:middle line:10%
that resided in the
Andromeda constellation

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:52.510 align:middle line:10%
and possibly even other star
systems throughout this galaxy.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.440 align:middle line:10%
They were the keepers of
the divine feminine energies

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.760 align:middle line:10%
in these systems and were known
for being adept sound frequency

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:10%
healers.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did your animation?

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:90%
well done.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.162 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, one
of your employees did.

00:42:05.162 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:90%
So Billy Rude.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:90%
He did a phenomenal job.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great job.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, he
did a phenomenal job.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
little creature

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning running
around, was that a gnome?

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.313 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That was like a
gnome or a pixie or a brownie.

00:42:16.313 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
depiction of a brownie.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.793 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did
they look so evil?

00:42:19.793 --> 00:42:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I don't
think they look evil.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.835 align:middle line:84%
I think they just
look different.

00:42:22.835 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that little
one looked kind of scary.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.188 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, I don't.

00:42:26.188 --> 00:42:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I think they looked cute.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's just me but--

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people find out
more about this topic, Debbie?

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They can visit my
website debbiesolaris.com.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell it out for us.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS:
D-E-B-B-I-E-S-O-L-A-R-I-S.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And if they go to the
training page on my website,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:10%
they will be able to
purchase this webinar.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is
your next project?

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: I'm working on
a galactic Akashic healing

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:10%
and clearing course.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.830 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to be
developing that this summer

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.445 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully offer
it in the fall.

00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.405 align:middle line:90%
It's been great to be here.

00:43:04.405 --> 00:43:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, earlier in the program,
I said I wouldn't go swimming

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.850 align:middle line:84%
with a mermaid, but after seeing
some of the great graphics,

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:90%
maybe I will.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
