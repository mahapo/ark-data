00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.530 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.298 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:12.814 align:middle line:84%
>>People basically going to
keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.694 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to another edition

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, you may be looking at
me, saying, wait a minute.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
That's not George.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you a real quick story
that I was trimming my mustache

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
this morning, and the
trimmer guide fell off,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't notice that.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
trimming my mustache.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I took the whole
half off by mistake.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had to make a
decision whether to do

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the show with half a
mustache or no mustache,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:90%
so I took the whole thing off.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It'll be back on a future
Beyond Belief show.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It grows pretty quickly.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But our special guest in this
program, Sandra-Leigh Serio--

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and Sandra, of course,
is a psychotherapist,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but a different
one because we're

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about astrology.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Sandra.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA-LEIGH SERIO:
Well, thank you.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel somewhat
naked without my mustache.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, that's
your issue, right?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, would astrology
have said, George,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a strange day today.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.784 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:01:28.784 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Astrology
would have said

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
that Mercury is
about to retrograde,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.806 align:middle line:90%
so you'll grow it back.

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it will.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.535 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: And it will.

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it will.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how a psychotherapist
got involved with astrology.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SERIO: Well, I'm really first
an astrologer and, second,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.855 align:middle line:10%
a psychotherapist.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:44.646 align:middle line:10%
It's a combination.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:10%


00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:10%
But if you know much
about astrology,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:10%
astrology is the
study of personality.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And what happens-- it's
kind of fascinating.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:10%
At the moment you
take your first breath

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:10%
independent of your mother,
when the umbilical cord is cut,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:10%
at that moment, you
take in the influences

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:10%
of the solar system
and the universe.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
And so each planet up in
the sky is frozen in time,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and each one represents
a different experience

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have in your
life, kind of like archetypes,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
where you can look
at Venus and talk

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
about love and relationship.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And so each planet has its
own individual meaning.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So we freeze that in time.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
sky keeps moving,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
but as we free it
in time, we also

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
draw a line to the horizon, and
that becomes your rising sign.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
connection to psychology

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:90%
is your personality pattern.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And based on personality--
think about this.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
That personality is-- astrology
chart is about personality.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.526 align:middle line:84%
Personality is about character,
and character is destiny.

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Sandra,
when they took Pluto out

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of the planet system
and made it a planetoid,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
did that screw things
up for astrologers?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, first
of all, Pluto's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the type of planet
that's used to that,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.835 align:middle line:84%
used to being somehow
sacrificed or-- I

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
mean, Pluto's used to being
kind of raped, in a sense,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:90%
always stripped of everything.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
No, it didn't bother us at all
because we had observed Pluto

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
for many, many,
many years, and we

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
know that it works
in a birth chart.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they could do
whatever they want to Pluto.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:90%
But we know it works.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And you could say
to someone who's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
a Scorpio, whoever
had a Pluto transit,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:90%
they know what Pluto's about.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Astrology,
of course, goes back--

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I would assume--
since the dawn of man.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yes, it does.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was just observing
the sky, and the planets,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and the eclipses,
and certain stars

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
rising, when the Nile flooded.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it has a
wonderful history.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It supposedly predates
all the other sciences.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it fell
out of favor because it just--

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that the powers that be
were afraid that people would

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
believe too much in astrology
and that they wouldn't believe

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.715 align:middle line:84%
in God and certain other
things and heads of state, so--

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I can see
how that could happen.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.664 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah.

00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.038 align:middle line:84%
You could understand
that, right?

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you look
at the stars in alignment

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
with everything
else, how does that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
coincide with the individual?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
How does that determine
the individual's future,

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:90%
the individual's past?

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Right, and
it's a fascinating study

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
because, again, each
of these planets

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
represent a different
part of your personality.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And their relationship to
each other up in the sky

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
could show harmony in certain
areas of your life or discord.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I said, we
freeze the sky in time,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes
your birth chart.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But this sky keeps moving,
and as it's moving,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
it triggers these
planets, and it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
triggers the events
and the activities.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing about astrology
that's really important

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and it is that it's not
so good at predicting

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:90%
an event that's going to happen.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.324 align:middle line:84%
But it's very accurate
at predicting experience.

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Experience-- so let's
say that your mother dies,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and you have a brother.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is the same
event, but the experience

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
to the two of you
is very different,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it
goes in astrology.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So in a chart, you might
see a loss in a chart,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
but the loss isn't always
a person in your life.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.344 align:middle line:90%
It could be a job.

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:19.385 align:middle line:90%
It could be a different--

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A
relationship, anything.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.271 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, it could
be anything, right?

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Or loss of money-- so
the experience is you

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
feel something's
taken away from you,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to an experience--
an event-- that you would feel.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come
it can't pinpoint,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
with a little more accuracy,
what that experience could be?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, it does
pinpoint the experience,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:90%
but we're not sure of the event.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.555 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure what's going
to cause the experience.

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping I'm
clarifying that for you.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
here's an example.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at someone's
astrological chart,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
can you determine if
something fatalistic

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen to them,
that maybe they're going to die?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, can you
determine when and how?

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: You can determine--
I feel, and a lot of people

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
feel this way,
that in a lifetime,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:84%
there might be two times,
maybe three, that you

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:90%
could exit this existence.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So the birth chart shows
you the timing of that.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%
That is a time to be careful.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We have free will, but
the free will, honestly,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
is kind of shrouded in destiny.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.412 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're kind of-- you
have free will in your choices,

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
things you can't

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
avoid in life because
it's part of your karma.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what you chose to
experience in this lifetime.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So it is difficult
to avoid, but you

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
can see certain times
that are difficult.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.359 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going to
talk about some charts later,

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see that maybe there
were times that were difficult

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that, if you knew astrology,
it might help you avoid

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
certain situations that
would make-- that would

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.421 align:middle line:90%
be catastrophic in your life.

00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were doing
a reading for an individual

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and you saw these huge-- I
will call them pits of life,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
would you tell them that
here's a danger point, folks?

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.715 align:middle line:90%
You got to be careful here.

00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I feel like you should
be honest with the client

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:90%
but not scare the client.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell
them what you see,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
but I'm very
diplomatic about it.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So I might say to someone,
you know, in this year,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
it's not a bad idea to stay
in touch with a doctor.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't ignore symptoms.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
that pops up,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
but you could probably
take care of it,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
as long as you go
visit the doctor.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.587 align:middle line:90%
Get a medical opinion on this.

00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you kind
of massage it a little.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, you have to.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:90%
But you do see certain things.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
question you

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
ask because timing
in astrology even

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
can be a little difficult
because I believe

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:90%
time is an illusion, right?

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not linear
like we think it is.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, in
astrology, things

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
can happen a little
earlier than you think,

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
or even a little
later than you think.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.897 align:middle line:84%
It's not always right
at that precise moment.

00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you never get to a
point where you look at a chart

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, my god!

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god!

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you run out of the
room or anything like that.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah,
you'd never do that.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want
to panic them that way.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.335 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: You never do that.

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But I did have a
client who's told me

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that a woman-- she
ran into a woman

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
in the supermarket who
was psychic, and the woman

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
said to her, oh,
my goodness, you've

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
had the most horrible
life, or something.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
She really kind of
scared her a little bit.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't so much the
woman as her husband had

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
had a very difficult
experience in his life,

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and I think she was
picking up on that.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But no, you'd never
do that to a client.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why doesn't science
get involved with astrology?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with the stars.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with planets.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
So there's a basis of
science right there.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But they don't seem
to get involved in it.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, it's more
qualitative, rather than

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:90%
quantitative.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
more about experience

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's more
empirical knowledge,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:90%
like what you're observing.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand about science,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.449 align:middle line:84%
they didn't like
psychology, either.

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They thought psychology was a
bunch of hooey 100 years ago,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
150 years, and they
didn't like it.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I
say, George, I think

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
it's better that the scientific
community does not recognize us

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
because we'd never have
access to anybody's birthday

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
if they realized
how powerful it was

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to see within the
personality of a person.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.219 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going
to-- I don't think

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:90%
you'll prove it scientifically.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they're looking
for more measurements

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
from the planets to prove that
the planets have an influence,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if it's so
much an influence as reflective,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:90%
like as above, so below.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's some kind of pattern
that we see that we can read,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
just like palmists
look at your palm

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and certain lines
mean certain things.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think it would
be hard to prove

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to the scientists, especially
the kind of-- what I call

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.669 align:middle line:84%
the sort of hardened scientists
that just-- you meet someone

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
at a party, and they'll
say, oh, you really

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
believe in that stuff?

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just say, well, how
long have you studied it?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they say,
well, I never have.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, yeah,
because it doesn't work.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, how do you know?

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Where's the open
mindedness on this?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If two people-- in my
particular case, born June 4,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.707 align:middle line:84%
1950-- are born on that day,
will we have a similar path?

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Oh, and there's
a great story about that.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you asked
that because you

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
would be astro twins.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're born on the same
day, at the same time,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.154 align:middle line:84%
in pretty much the
same geographical

00:10:14.154 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
location because different--

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.986 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you say same time-- I

00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
was born at 10:33
AM in the morning.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Does somebody have to be
born at 10:33 in the morning?

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Within a
minute of that, yes.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
story, as it goes,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that somewhere in
ancient time, there

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
was two people born
at the same time.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
One was a-- his father was
the king of the country,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and the other one was a pauper.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.329 align:middle line:90%
But they had the same chart.

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying,
well, how could that be?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's environment, right?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But on the day that the son of
the king ascended the throne,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
the pauper opened a shop up.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So in his environment
and his circumstances,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:90%
that was a big deal.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:90%
He became a merchant.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
He became a store owner.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And to him, that was
just as an important

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:84%
an experience as the man
who became the king, right?

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Different event,
same experience.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at a
number of people, including me.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: OK.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: June, 4, 1950,
10:33 in the morning.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Hey, world, here I come.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, I think
the most wonderful thing

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
about that is you freely give
out your birth information.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not afraid of anybody
delving into who you are.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you, I
looked at this chart yesterday,

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I think
he should sing.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.887 align:middle line:90%
He has all this music in here.

00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that you
actually do a little singing.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yes, I know.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
That was surprising.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I do events
around the country

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and will sing with
a band or stuff.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.551 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, I mean,
music is within you.

00:11:48.551 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very selective songs.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right.

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So of course-- and
maybe you've heard this

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.726 align:middle line:90%
before-- you're a Gemini.

00:11:54.726 --> 00:11:56.226 align:middle line:84%
That's the sign of
the communicator.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And not every person is going
to communicate to the level

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But all Geminis would
need to communicate

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.712 align:middle line:84%
on some level, like have their
voice be heard in some way.

00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
Leo rising, which,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:90%
of course, is the performer.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.672 align:middle line:90%
So here we go again.

00:12:10.672 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're a
natural performer,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
as you probably know,
and you have your moon,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
which is your
emotional nature, what

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.227 align:middle line:84%
you need in life is Aquarius,
which is people, community.

00:12:21.227 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
things that are going

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to be near and
dear to your heart.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
your chart, the planets

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
are scattered all
over the place.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.679 align:middle line:84%
That's a chart like
Thomas Jefferson--

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little like my life.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, like your life.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But what it means is, which
is beautiful about it,

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:90%
is a universalist.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You could be a scattered person.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But you could be
a universalist who

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
knows a little bit about
everything, you see?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And you do.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You interview people
from different walks

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
of life and different
backgrounds, right?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:90%
So if it reflects who you are.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're an
information gatherer.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You know a little bit
about a lot of things,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
or you know a lot a bit
about a lot of things.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:10%
And then, your chart has what's
called the grand triangle

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:10%
in it-- grand trine,
beautiful-- and air signs,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.444 align:middle line:10%
the sign of communication--
here we go again.

00:13:06.444 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
something called

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
these minor grand
trines, which are

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:90%
two planets 120 degrees apart.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of them
is a planet 60 degrees.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And those are talent trines.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So they also give you great
creative ability, by the way.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, again,
you converse with people,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and you do that very well.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So I like to look at charts
sometimes as past lives.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
at yours, I really

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
believe you were a singer
in another lifetime,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.865 align:middle line:84%
that you used your
voice as a livelihood.

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt like you were also a
spokesperson for something

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
in another lifetime, somebody
that Jane Roberts in those Seth

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:84%
books, if you've
ever read those--

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember those.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: She talked
about speakers,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that these are speakers in
our century or in our world,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.209 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you were
one of these speakers.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:10%
You had something to say
that was important for people

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:10%
to listen to.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:10%
I also feel that,
in a past life--

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:10%
I say there's a very strong
spirituality here, of course,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:10%
because your sun and Neptune,
the spiritual planet,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:10%
are in harmony.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's very natural for you.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of see you as a
yogi in another lifetime,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
meditating on a mountaintop
in one of the lifetimes.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've done such
a variety of things.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You're a very old soul,
but you probably know that.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But you're also a very hard
worker in this lifetime.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And working and being
industrious and ethical-- I

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
think those things are
very important to you.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
believed in reincarnation,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.977 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that the soul
reincarnates until it perfects,

00:14:39.977 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and then it doesn't
come back anymore.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why am I
still coming back?

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.271 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:44.271 --> 00:14:45.686 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I think
you're a speaker.

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot to
offer the world.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.401 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're coming back
because you have a really

00:14:49.401 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
definite purpose
to sort of raise

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
of other people.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
keep coming back.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But you might not have too many
more lifetimes to finish this.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:90%
You might not.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.725 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
near, I think, the end.

00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Getting close.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Right, you're
getting close, yeah.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.357 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Oh, I think
it's a good thing.

00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I would
miss this planet.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Well, you would.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
why you're coming back

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
now again and again.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sadly, we lost a
great comedian, a great actor,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:90%
with Robin Williams.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I know.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at some of his work.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.294 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.294 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm very excited
because this is

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:10%
my time when I was watching
World Cup Soccer, my man.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:10%
I saw World Cup, baby.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.554 align:middle line:10%
No, no.

00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
A few soccer fans-- the
rest of you are going,

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.812 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's like football
without pads, right?

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of the
world, it's football.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's like Australian
sport played by damaged people.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, we made it
in the World Cup.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Everybody plays it.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.115 align:middle line:84%
Not like the World
Series, because the French

00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:90%
don't have a baseball team.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.114 align:middle line:84%
If they did, they would
only have left field,

00:15:50.114 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:90%
and no one would be safe.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.905 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:53.905 --> 00:15:55.402 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:56.899 align:middle line:90%
What can you do, huh?

00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robin Williams
was, as we just saw,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%
a dynamic performer.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about him?

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, he was a Cancer,
and he was very sensitive.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, he was
Scorpio rising, so he

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
did have a private side to him.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, sometimes, it
was a little bit dark.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And he-- the fascinating
thing about this chart

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
is the ruler of his ascendant,
Pluto and Mars, and the ruler

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
of his eight house, which
is the house of death--

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:84%
it's also surgery,
taxes, things you

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
can't avoid in this lifetime,
as they say-- those two

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
planets-- it was Mercury
ruling his house of death

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto ruling
his physical body,

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
the ascendant-- were
conjoined in his chart

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
in a very public
place, which means

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that he could have a
hand in his own death.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And he
did, unfortunately.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But he was in a very
bad cycle, and if he

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
had known that, in
just a few more days,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
he would have been
out of that cycle.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
He also, like you, is a
spokesperson-- the Mercury,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.038 align:middle line:84%
the communication, and Leo--
he was the star performer.

00:17:07.038 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:90%
There was no doubt.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:90%
We all knew him.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.331 align:middle line:90%
We loved his humor.

00:17:09.331 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And he had Mercury with
Pluto, which, again,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see very deep
into people with that

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
or into a situation,
but it can also

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
put you a little bit on
the dark side at times

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:90%
if you can't control that.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And he had a Pisces moon.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Pisces moon people absorb
everything around them,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
so he could take in
other people's pain.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:90%
He really could.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.272 align:middle line:84%
But what a wonderful man, and
such a sad loss for the world.

00:17:35.272 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would his
chart have shown

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.867 align:middle line:84%
you, Sandra, of the
conflict within himself?

00:17:39.867 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Absolutely.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would have.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Mars, the co-ruler of his
ascendant-- physical body,

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
the way-- his projection
to the world--

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
was with the planet
Uranus, which

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
can be a genius on one
hand, but a little bit

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
erratic on the other hand.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, in
a chart, you can

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:90%
see people who have mood swings.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see the potential
for bipolar disorder

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
or for some other
mental disorders.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have been
able to had advised him,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.799 align:middle line:90%
we have a serious problem here?

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
You need some help.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, but I don't
know if he would have listened.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:90%
See, some people don't listen.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:90%
And you could have advised him.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Someone could've
advised him to be

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:84%
very careful during
that time frame.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That was a tough-- we had
a Mars-Saturn conjunction

kind of in Scorpio,
which is kind of unusual.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio is very deep
and dark and frustrating.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
other things in his chart

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that were going on
at the time as well.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you can pinpoint
periods in your life

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that you just-- you've
got to be careful.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%

person we're going

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
to do a reading on--
on a chart, of course--

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.725 align:middle line:84%
is another former,
late superstar.

>>War's over, man.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.116 align:middle line:90%
Wormer dropped the big one.

00:18:49.116 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Over?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Did you say "over?"

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:10%
Nothing is over until
we decide it is.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Was it over when the
Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Hell, no!

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.331 align:middle line:90%
>>Germans?

00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Forget it.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:90%
He's rolling.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:14.995 align:middle line:84%
>>It ain't over now because
when the going gets tough--

00:19:14.995 --> 00:19:16.468 align:middle line:90%
the tough get going.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John Belushi,
again, like Robin Williams,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
entertained millions of
people, was well loved,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.965 align:middle line:90%
but had demons within him.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, and he
did have the signature

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
of bipolar disorder.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I'm not saying--
I'm not diagnosing him,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just saying there
was the potential for that

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
in the chart.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you see these
potentials in charts

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
or you see potentials
of drug addiction,

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and the person is
not drug addicted,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but they work with drug
addicts all the time.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So it has to influence
their life in some way.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So he had this moon in the sign
of Sagittarius, opposite Uranus

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
in the sign of Gemini.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So emotionally, the
moon is your emotions.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Uranus is erraticness
and genius.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
lot of ups and downs.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:10%
He had a luck
factor in this chart

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:10%
that I think got him
into show business,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:10%
but that same luck factor
showed indulgences, overkill,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.965 align:middle line:10%
not knowing your boundaries
with food and drink and drugs.

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
self-destructive?

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I don't think overtly.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I think he was just a guy
that-- he didn't have strong

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, so he thought
he could do more, and more,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and more, and still--

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pushed himself.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, and be
invincible or impervious to it

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:90%
affecting him.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
was a misjudgment.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does a chart like
John Belushi's-- does it spike?

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you see things that
just stick right out?

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Oh, yeah.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:10%
He did have a great luck
factor of Venus and Jupiter

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.216 align:middle line:10%
together in the
sign of Capricorn.

00:20:53.216 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:10%
We see this
sometimes with people

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:10%
who financially don't have to
worry that much about money,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:10%
usually.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We also see it with
people who are lucky.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
He makes friends.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:90%
They like him.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So it opens up his
world for him--

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that he can attain
some of his desires.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.184 align:middle line:90%
And that was the performing.

00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
He had a good Neptune.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Neptune are creative people
who can do imitations,

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and he certainly
was born with that.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.611 align:middle line:84%
And it was an exact square from
Venus and Jupiter to Neptune,

00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's, again,
where he didn't realize

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the danger of
experimenting with drugs.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You see, it would be
like kind of delusional.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thought it was
obvious, he should have known.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.851 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right, he should have.

00:21:31.851 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the chart-- or
does the chart show the death

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
or something that you could
interpret as the death?

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: You mean
at the time he died?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.366 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yes.

00:21:43.366 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
in front of me,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
but there were
factors, certainly,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:90%
that would set this up.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you would
see some major events.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: You would see
these things being set off

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:90%
in the chart.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you would.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And he had Pluto in his
eighth house of death

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that he was born with,
and it was in Leo.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
So he's having a good time.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Leo is let's have fun.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to a party.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's perform.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.034 align:middle line:84%
And so-- yeah, and it's
really too bad, right?

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
We've lost some really
wonderful people.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We sure have.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:90%
We lost another one.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.629 align:middle line:90%

>>SERIO: You can

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
So Capricorn.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So there was
ambition, of course.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns-- they
want to produce.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They want to be
productive in life.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And he had Sagittarius rising.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
He actually loved
traveling around.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is a person who
likes to have a good time,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:90%
and he did.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And in his chart, he
had another Pisces moon,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
which means this sensitivity,
just like Robin Williams.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
He was-- some people
with Pisces moons,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:84%
especially men--
it's hard for them

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because their emotions
are not-- they

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
don't acknowledge them as
strongly as women might.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And so a Pisces
moon-- he absorbs

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
all the negativity
around him as well

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:90%
as the positiveness around him.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think he had a
little bit of a temper.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
little bit of a temper

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.591 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit of frustration.

00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Would those
demons have shown up?

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
If you had done a reading
for him when he was born,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
would you have seen the
same pattern, even though he

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.146 align:middle line:84%
was only two months
old, let's say?

00:23:57.146 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.186 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you would
see the potential.

00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
That's where there
is some free will.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But you see a potential to
sort of look at the dark side

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
or to delve into the dark
side there a little bit.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
You could see that.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure he-- there
were things he just

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
couldn't shake in his life--
couldn't shake them off.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And also,
it shows he had

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a difficult
childhood, which

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think is
written about very much.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, you don't
blame the parents.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It could be how he interpreted
his childhood and what he felt.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
He might have felt that his
parents were hard on him.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
He might have felt that
they were restricting

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:90%
his emotional expression.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And they might not have
felt they were doing that,

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
so we're not
blaming the parents.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.237 align:middle line:84%
But this is his
interpretation of it.

00:24:38.237 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our last person,
of course-- again,

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
another superstar that some of
you will know, and some of you

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
may not.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.294 align:middle line:90%

Darin, singing one

00:25:07.924 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite songs,
"Beyond the Sea."

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
A classic person, died
at 37 of heart issues.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:84%
He was operated on, never
came out of it, and died.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:90%
What do we see here?

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well,
part of what I see

00:25:22.425 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:84%
is they might have waited
too long to do the surgery,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they just didn't have
the techniques they have now

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
or the medicine they have.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He probably would
have been alive today.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Today-- I
agree with you there.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, the voice-- he was
Taurus, the sign of the voice.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Streisand, Taurus.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the voice.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And he had-- he was a
Taurus with Taurus rising,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
so this is a double impact of
this wonderful voice he had.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And Venus was rising in
the chart when he was born,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.604 align:middle line:84%
which is a blessing
if you have that.

00:25:52.604 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And I think he liked people.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
He had an Aquarius
moon, like you do,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
so a need with
community and people.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And he had a lot of Gemini.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
He was versatile-- was a
versatile person, maybe more so

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:90%
than it showed in his career.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It might not have shown
as much of his versatility

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
as he was capable of.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel that,
when I look at this chart,

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
there might have been a genetic
factor involved in his heart.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.175 align:middle line:90%
In those days--

00:26:18.175 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had rheumatic
fever when he was a little boy.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.674 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, there it is.

00:26:21.674 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the genetic factor.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But also, in the '30s, women
took different drugs sometimes

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
during pregnancy
because they didn't

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
realize the effect
it could have.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And there might have
been some exposure

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:10%
that his mother had
that also affected him,

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:10%
and the rheumatic fever would
just exacerbate it, right?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's sad
when I look at it

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.902 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
great performer.

00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We lost another one.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.318 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: We lost another one.

00:26:47.318 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandra, if people
want to get a hold of you,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
or if they want to check out
what you do, where do they go?

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Probably, my
website is the best place.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell it out for us.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SERIO: Well, it's
sandraleigh.com,

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.375 align:middle line:10%
and Leigh is L-E-I-G-H.

Well, I look forward

in another future issue
of "Beyond Belief."

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Astrology-- it's a fascinating--
to me, a fascinating science,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.190 align:middle line:10%
where the charts of
stars and planets

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:10%
truly can pinpoint and
determine your future.
