00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.395 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.166 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.416 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.165 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to give
people the information.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR: And now the host
of the nationally syndicated

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: The sad part of
living is one day all of us are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
going to die.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sure many of you aren't
in any rush to get there,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.171 align:middle line:90%
but imagine dying three times.

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things we're going

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to talk about on
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
My guest tonight, noted
author, "Saved By the Light,"

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
this person died three times.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And thank God, he's here to
talk about it, Dannion Brinkley.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.265 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:11.196 align:middle line:84%
All right, hey,
you're looking good.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.237 align:middle line:84%
>> DANNION BRINKLEY: You're
the one looking good.

00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Way to go, George.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.595 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Gosh,
it's been awhile.

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: It's
been way too long.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Before we get into
these incredible things that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
happened to you, I want you
know that the Dannion is now

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
devoting his life to what he
calls the Twilight Brigade.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Somebody like me,
I spent nine years

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:90%
in the United States Navy.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I understand--

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.212 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Come on.

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:35.693 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --what's it's like.

00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:36.655 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Service
is service, right?

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
service is service.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But you spend almost
all your waking time

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
at the bedside of soldiers
who are almost ready to die.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.125 align:middle line:84%
And you, my friend, deserve
a round of applause.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.666 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
thank you, George.

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> [APPLAUSE]But do
you know what, George?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
If you go through
this experience

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that we presently call death,
and you realize that it never

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
really happens-- I grew
up as a complete jackass,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
tough, redneck, hillbilly
from South Carolina.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You were mean.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And served in the
Marine Corps during that weird

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to see
that kind of personality,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and you see the world
from that point of view,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.809 align:middle line:84%
you would never even
appreciate the idea

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of that there was
a life after death.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.745 align:middle line:84%
And if you grew up in
the fundamentalist South,

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you knew for sure you
were going to hell.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And from the time I
was five years old,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
everybody told me I
was going to hell.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you suddenly
discover-- one day

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:90%
you're talking on the phone.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't believe any of that
stuff, fundamentalist religion

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality and these palm
readers and all that stuff,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
you don't believe
any of that crap.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
One day, you get
struck by lightning,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
you're burning in your own fire.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:90%
You cannot move.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.884 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what happened.

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And lightning hits me
in the side of the head,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and it goes down
my spine, and it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.347 align:middle line:84%
welds the nails of the heels
of my shoes to the floor,

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:01.305 align:middle line:84%
throws me in the air and
suspends me in the air

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and throws me back down.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't see and I can't move.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
I lift out of my body.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Raymond Moody's
legendary book

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
had not been written, George.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I had nowhere to turn to as
I'm looking down at my body

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and watching what's
going on around me.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.875 align:middle line:84%
But I'm watching it from
a different point view.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching it from a point
of view as I'm an observer.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.245 align:middle line:84%
Like watching a 3-D
film, I'm an observer.

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And no pain.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%
No pain.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: No pain
and I could see.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
When I was lying on
the floor, the flash

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
of the ball of lightning burnt
my eyes so bad I couldn't see.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I lifted
out, I could see.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I was safe.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I was at peace.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at it
from another point of view.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.022 align:middle line:84%
I was an observer of the events,
as opposed to a participant.

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I just need
to let everybody know.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:84%
After I went through
this standard, near-death

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
experience, it took
me two years to learn

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:90%
to walk and feed myself.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.185 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I was
dead for 28 minutes.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
paralyzed for six days,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed for
seven months, two years

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to learn to walk
and feed myself.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
If I had not discovered that
this is just a part of life,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:90%
I would have never made it.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I would never made it.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And where we move to, in
this advancing world of where

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
we are, where
we're moving to is,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
we now have doctors
who are going

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
through the
near-death experience,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
with the standard arguments used
by scientists as their basis.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But now those doctors are
having these experiences.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed, on "Coast to
Coast," Dr. Evan Alexander,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
a neurosurgeon who never would
have believed in the afterlife.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:90%
But he had meningitis.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
He was in a coma.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I came back.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.619 align:middle line:84%
You found that out, not
once, not twice, three times.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But what you
have to also look at, George,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I was a non-believer.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you lift
out of your body

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and you see the spiritual
identity of yourself,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
you recognize the
safety of where you are.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And that I have gone through
struck by lightning, 13

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
years later, open heart surgery,
seven years after that, brain

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
surgery, given less than
a 10% chance of surviving.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
After the brain surgery, I
spent 41 hours in recovery

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
because they could
bring me back.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Then I had a massive
grand mall seizure,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.552 align:middle line:84%
went into cardiac arrest,
and was put in life support.

00:05:39.552 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you done
with those episodes now?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.718 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I need one more.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want
one more, huh?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: One
more, because, look,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
when you realize you don't die,
and you realize the science is

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
coming forth to prove it, we
don't have to listen to swamis

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and people being
contemplating their navel.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to listen to that.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The argument in science with
it based on quantum dynamics

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.255 align:middle line:84%
and quantum physics is
quantifying the fact

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that the possibility
of it exists.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.095 align:middle line:84%
They called it the
non-local reality

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of probable possibilities.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a scientific term,
because in quarks they're

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
seeing all these things
come to-- there are neurons.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
can't explain it.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Not only
can then not explain it,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.612 align:middle line:84%
they have to recognize
that it exists.

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So here is
where we sit it in this age.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
In this age of
transformation, we

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
have to take a good look
at death as a value.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And why it's so
important, and why

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that
you and this show

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.797 align:middle line:90%
are doing this, baby boomers.

00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's us.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.546 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yes, sir.

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're the
next on the list.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
We are the largest
expanded group

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of births in Western
history, 1945 to 1967.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
With the few people who have
come in with green cards,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.611 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a few who don't,
we're roughly 81 million people

00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I hope I'm
down on that list.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.444 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I hope
I'm right at the top.

00:07:06.444 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We'll you've been
there before, I haven't.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But
this is the point.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
You see, George, I know
there's life after death,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
because I had one
death experience

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
for 28 minutes,
wrapped, tagged, bagged.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And then two near-death
experiences, open heart surgery

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:90%
and brain surgery.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So I have a 22 year
period to observe.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And because of this
event, the greatest thing

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that anybody can take from
the near-death experience,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
there is no such thing as death.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:90%
You have to get over it.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think you were
sent back to give us messages?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, I was
on a radio show with one

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of your competitors,
if you have any.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We don't have
competitors on the radio show.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.394 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Just checking.

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:53.565 align:middle line:90%
I had to clarify the language.

00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I was on a show and
someone asked me,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
they said, Mr. Brinkley, you
have like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.595 align:middle line:90%
Hyde personality.

00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, what's the point?

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As you smacked them.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.239 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
or thought about it.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Given the maximum opportunity
to die for whatever

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:90%
you believed in.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.292 align:middle line:84%
And so when you listen
to it, I said, well.

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
why in the world do

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
you think God
would pick somebody

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
like you to come back and
bring forth this information?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know the
answer to that.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They were scraping the
absolute bottom of the barrel.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.108 align:middle line:90%
And they said, wait a minute.

00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:37.378 align:middle line:84%
We've completely
run out of messiahs.

00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've got to tell you,
doesn't he look a little like

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:90%
an angel?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You say
that all the time.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.094 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You look
like an archangel.

00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
missing are wings.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Now they must be back
there, somewhere.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, I would
have a show if I had wings.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:90%
But you know something, George?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:84%
As we move and we grow and
our age group transforms,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.555 align:middle line:84%
by looking at this
research-- let

00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
me finish my punchline
of my other joke.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.107 align:middle line:84%
So when the lady
said, why do you

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
think God would have picked you?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, they were scraping the
absolute bottom of the barrel.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They had completely
run out of messiahs,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were sitting
around at the angel bar

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
taking cloud shakes and they
said, here's what let's do.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's find us a jackass.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's put it all off
on him and send him back

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to see how well he does.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:29.965 align:middle line:90%
And she laughed.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you may
think that's funny,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
but that's how
you got here, too.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
When you start to look
at how you got here,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
you got here the same way
as I got here, everybody.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
different about me,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:90%
except I know you don't die.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So what motivates
me is not fear.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
What motivates me is
intention and direction

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
of what I want to
achieve and why

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to achieve it, from
the highest standards.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And when people start to
look at this issue of death,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
it will be the driving force of
the next 40 years, the next 51,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Maya, of this culture.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.554 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you're not in
a rush to jump off, are you ?

00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: You never know.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You enjoy your life.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Ooh,
come on, George.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.608 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's changed.

00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:90%
You're a good guy now.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You devote your time to the
troops and the fallen soldiers.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.512 align:middle line:84%
You're not in a rush to get
to the other side, are you?

00:10:23.512 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You never know
when the bell is going to ring.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you have been dead,
you better get ready.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:84%
If you've been where
I've been, you better

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
clear your
consciousness, you better

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
take a look a bit back
that whatever scares you

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:90%
the most is not death.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
You perceive it as that
from a religious context.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But what affects you the most
is pain associated with death.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And the methodologies
of advancement

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of chemistry and medicine
in our environment.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.195 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Back about four
years ago, in St. Louis,

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine
is a motorcyclist.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.016 align:middle line:90%
And he died.

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
it served him right.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.915 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He did-- well,
he did something stupid.

00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That
will teach him.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He was-- you know,
the old cop lights were up,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:90%
and he decided, you know what?

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to outrun these guys.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: He was
probably in the Navy.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.969 align:middle line:90%
Was he under your command?

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, he was not.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.216 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Just checking.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He hit
a car broadside,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
goes flying off the bike and
lands on top of a stop sign,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and it almost severed his body.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, he died.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I go to the funeral, and for
the first time in my life

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.002 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this corpse-- I
hate these things, by the way.

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Why?

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I just don't like
these wakes and funerals

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.246 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:42.536 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I can accept that.

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I'm
looking at this guy.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.171 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Open casket?

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Open casket, and
I'm thinking to myself--

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why this
came over me-- but I said,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
what if there's not
life after death?

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:90%
What if it doesn't exist?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the loneliest
feeling I've ever had.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought about you
and other people I've talked to,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:90%
about what is on the other side.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And it came back
to me real fast.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I got to tell you,
it's the worst feeling thinking

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
else, that it's over.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.535 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But you
know what, George?

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Think about it like this.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
What I decided to do from
my near-death experience,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, people say
it's life changing,

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:90%
you hear all the stories.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I figured, based on what I
had seen on the other side,

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities are
the absolute magnificence

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that we are, that we chose to
block from our consciousness

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.425 align:middle line:84%
so we can achieve the goals
we chose to come to do here.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.951 align:middle line:84%
I figured what
could I do the best?

00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The best that I could do
with my life as my hobby,

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.802 align:middle line:84%
and I have only one hobby,
OK, which is end of life care.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I love
to be at the bedside.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been a hospice
volunteer for 35 years.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I have somewhere around
28,000 hours at the bedside.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I've been with 2,006 people
going from this world

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
to the next, and 423
taking their last breath.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you
tell them, at that moment?

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.172 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: You listen.

00:13:10.172 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:90%
You listen.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody needs closure.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
you were lonely when

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
you were looking in that
casket, think about it

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%
when you have a month.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Think about when
you fought in a war,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and you shot people
who looked like you

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or didn't look like you,
and you swept a village

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.930 align:middle line:84%
with burning children and
animals and mission, mission,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
mission.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, just like any
military, mission, mission,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:90%
mission.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.202 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you get
to lying in that bed

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
look at your life,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
has to have closure,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
there's an art
form to transition.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that I would
try to co-create that,

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
so that not only do I talk about
it, write books about death

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.464 align:middle line:90%
and dying, I live it.

00:13:54.464 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
there, every day.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.296 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some
questions for you.

00:13:57.296 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Dannion Brinkley with us.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go ahead.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Claudia.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, people
are on great amounts

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of morphine and other
drugs before they die.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that
affects the dying process?

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Are they able to transcend?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.564 align:middle line:90%
Two levels in morphine.

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Morphine is a painkiller,
and it's a good one.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't allow
you to be lucid.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Oxycontin is a
better painkiller,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
but people abuse it,
and here we go again.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.399 align:middle line:90%
But what has to happen is this.

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The moment you lift
out of your body,

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
all that other
chemistry is nonsense.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We're in two places
in our world.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Chemistry and
scientists, they believe

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
in basic physics,
chemistry, pharmacology.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So they think that the
brain creates everything.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That every felling you
have, every emotion you have

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
is based on chemistry.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means everything
is a dead universe,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
or we focus from
the spiritual point

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
believe it's a living universe.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
the deciding factor.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you deal with
morphine, agitation, the things

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that you see, the moment
you lift out of your body,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you're not attached
to the chemistry

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and the medicalogical prospects
and aspects of your identity.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
You go from the human
mental, physical identity

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual identity,
which is naturally you, always.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Life is like a costume party.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You dress up in this big bag
of water, which is basically

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
empty space, and you
come into this dimension

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:90%
to think you are real.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And science can prove,
you're not only not real,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
you're not even here.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
greatest part of it.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love that.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I've got to ask you
this about dying.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I popped a pizza roll
in a microwave oven.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:90%
And I read the instructions.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.534 align:middle line:90%
I did what I was supposed to do.

00:15:48.534 --> 00:15:49.908 align:middle line:84%
And it says, make
sure it's cool.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I touched it,
and it was cool.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I popped this little thing
in my mouth and I bit into it,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:90%
and it was like molten lava.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.298 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I'm sorry.

00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it burned the
top of the skin off the roof

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
of my mouth.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But what it also
did was, it started

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to compress my ear passage.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It started swelling up.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.774 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't breathe.

00:16:07.774 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Physical
defense mechanism.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And to me, one of
the worst ways of dying is

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
suffocating, because you just
can't breathe or anything.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't sleep,
Dannion, that whole night.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Makes sense.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because I didn't know
if I was going to not be able

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:90%
to breathe.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't if my auto reflexes
would kick in and I'd be OK.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed awake.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was a horrible feeling.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
When you die-- and I
got to ask you this--

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.612 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to be morbid.

00:16:30.612 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, be morbid.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I
mean, does it hurt?

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: No.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Pain comes in the
medical paradigms.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Pain comes in the injury.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you've been at this,
because, George, remember, what

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
gave me the platform-- I'm
just another near-death

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
experiencer-- but what
gave me this platform

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to speak emphatically about it
is, I've had this experience.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And I die with people.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I study it.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:90%
I study ways to reduce the fear.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I watch the pain that happens.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But the hospital that
they took me to in 1975,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on September 17,
Dr. Raymond Moody,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the author of
"Life After Life"--

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The giant of this.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.792 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Godfather, was
a medical intern and going

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to medical school at the
hospital they brought me to.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.041 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about that.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And I became
a fable in the hospital.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
180 something thousand
volts for 2 and 1/2 seconds,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
melted the telephone.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And that I was
struggling to stay alive,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
but I was paralyzed.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
So Raymond found me.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship
of the early days

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death
experience, I got

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to be around Raymond Moody and
Bruce Greyson and Michael Sabom

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.882 align:middle line:84%
and Ian Stevenson
and George Richie.

00:17:46.882 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The giants
of that field.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, and Ken
Ring-- when they were brave.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They were stepping out
into a world to see,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
based on studying these
things, a phenomena happening.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we had advancements in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
because we had new medical
paradigm protocol procedures.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
More and more of us
are going to come back.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we are a part
of the mainstream.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We're part of the dialogue
when people on television

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
say, well, that was a
near-death experience.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming a part
of the mainstream.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
What I hope what
your show is doing,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and what this program does,
is drive people to come

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
to get concise information
about the reality

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
they live in, but based on
real identifiable causes

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and purposes.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to die.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not going to
die, then the next thing

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:90%
is, why are you living?

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I watched George
Richie, a brilliant psychiatrist

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Virginia,
where Raymond went to do

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is internship for
psychiatry, because he

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be a
forensic psychiatrist.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.762 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to study
serial killers.

00:18:58.762 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:90%
This is how cool Raymond--

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: To each his own.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That's
how cool Raymond is.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.613 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But we know
Raymond, and he's different.

00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: He's a little,
I call him the Rain Man, OK?

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
it from that point,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and I've watched 37
years of this experience,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and I've lived on the
cutting edge about it

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and sold millions and millions
of books and live in it,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
reduce the fear of death.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And religion and institutions
and government structures

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.735 align:middle line:90%
in place, a sense of--

00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Fear.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: --fear
and an inequality.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
That we begin to think we're
not great powerful and mighty

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And the very moment that you
think anything other than that,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you have a tendency to
fall for so many things.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to
depend on it's fear-based.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff comes about.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not driven
by being fear-based,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:90%
and my life is full.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.717 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly can't wait
till that bell rings again.

00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just don't come and
get me when you get there.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back in just a
moment with Dannion Brinkley.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.238 align:middle line:84%
More "Beyond Belief,"
don't go away.

00:20:09.238 --> 00:20:12.202 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:20:12.202 --> 00:20:14.664 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.664 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with
Dannion Brinkley.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:90%
This is a live studio audience.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:90%
This is not canned applause.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
If it was, we'd still be
clapping for you, Dannion.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.852 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I am great, George.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
always a pleasure.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:90%
What is it like to die?

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:90%
You said it was fast.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:90%
You said it doesn't hurt.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody is in a car
accident-- I've always wondered

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
this-- even if it's
a split second,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%
they got to feel something.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Well.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.001 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or is it just
gone, the lights are out?

00:20:47.001 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Depends, OK?

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Because each of us are
unique and individual.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to accept that
there's no common position.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
We are each unique, individual,
great, powerful, and mighty

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.285 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
could ever go wrong

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:05.368 align:middle line:84%
with a great, powerful,
and mighty spiritual being

00:21:05.368 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
with dignity,
direction, and purpose,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.325 align:middle line:84%
if they have allowed something
to affect their dignity.

00:21:10.325 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Death and the fear of
death affects your dignity,

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.485 align:middle line:84%
which affects your
direction and purpose.

00:21:15.485 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
there's no other crisis.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people
need a little pain.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I got struck by
lightning, was burning

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and on fire, was
blinded, and paralyzed.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Who were you
talking to, do you remember?

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I was
talking to my best friend.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I know it was him that was
supposed to get struck.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.659 align:middle line:84%
But you know, God probably
had a Grand Marnier that day.

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, and
my mother always told me,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
during lightning, George,
stay off the phone.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.034 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't believe her.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And here you are.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.625 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, you keep
doing it. then, George.

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, everything that
I've ever had happened to me,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.994 align:middle line:90%
I had it coming.

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You were that bad?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.327 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Oh, please!

00:21:57.327 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's not--

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But you were a Marine.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.371 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Oorah!

00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Get some.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But a bad one?

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.085 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
I was a good one.

00:22:03.085 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A good Marine?

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yes, sir.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A bad person?

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, yeah.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
But pain comes in this.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to so many
people who are resuscitated,

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
because like I said
earlier, I lived

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
around the beginning
researchers.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
When it wasn't like Ebert or Pim
van Lommel, the brilliant works

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.782 align:middle line:84%
of scientists
looking at something

00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
they totally couldn't believe
because they were scientists.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And yet it occurs.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And now it's call
non-local possibilities

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
in quantum science.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
ancient traditions.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
modern day physics.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Modern day ways to
look at this issue.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
We just have to move past
the fear base and embrace it,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
because every
single one of us are

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:90%
going to be a hospice volunteer.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So in pain, depends on
looking at how long you

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:90%
want to prolong that pain.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
$0.70 of every dollar in health
care is spent in the last six

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
months of life to extend
life an average of 16 days.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever
seen that 16 days,

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
based on fear and your
family and medical issues--

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because if $0.70 of every
dollar is spent in the last six

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.245 align:middle line:84%
months, where's all the money
going and who's getting paid?

00:23:14.245 --> 00:23:15.786 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
what it's all about.

00:23:15.786 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I went online a
couple months ago

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at my high school
class that had graduated.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And they had little
depictions of people,

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, George Noory doing
this, and people like that.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was in shock,
Dannion, at how many people

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
in my graduating
class have died.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Some in Vietnam, some
in car accidents,

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:90%
some because of ill health.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
get us all one day.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: It's
going to increase.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:90%
So let's finish pain.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Any time somebody's in
pain, you've got it coming.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.402 align:middle line:84%
Because there was something you
were doing stupid, or something

00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't believe
about yourself that you would

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.909 align:middle line:84%
put yourself in a place
that you prolong it.

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:02.325 align:middle line:84%
But I've talked
to people, George,

00:24:02.325 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
who have been in car accidents,
that it is impossible for them

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to have survived it,
but somehow they did.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.689 align:middle line:90%
97% observed it from above.

00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So there
is a mechanism that,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
when the check is getting
ready to be cashed,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
there is a system in
play that says, oh, well,

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:90%
this fool won't make it.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And lifts them out
so they observe it.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, by whatever how the
divine determines these things,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to come back.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.505 align:middle line:84%
And you know from
people who have

00:24:34.505 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
had these kind of
experiences, your children

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
need to be raised, your
grandmother's not ready,

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:90%
you have to go back.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, no one ever gave me a
choice to stay or come back,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if they'd have
given me a choice,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
this would be an empty chair and
you'd be talking to a mirror.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:84%
There is no way,
once you see there,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that this place is anything
but like a playground.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to Disneyland.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.279 align:middle line:90%
You want to stay over there.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
know what it's like?

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you
think you're dead?

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Does that even
come into your mind

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
when you're on the other side?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Not till the
panoramic life review.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.599 align:middle line:84%
You lift out of
your body, you watch

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
everything that's
going on around you

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from a non-attached
point of view.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.540 align:middle line:84%
You have a certain
sense of finality

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and you're an observer.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But you become a distinguished--
with being of integrity.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.465 align:middle line:84%
You don't have your little
pseudo psychological natures

00:25:29.465 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.101 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, at
what point do you say,

00:25:32.101 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:90%
I haven't eaten in six months.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when does it
hit you and you realize

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:90%
you're not human anymore?

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY:
Panoramic life review.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I never-- I mean, it
was just someplace else.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And wherever it was I
was better from where

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I left, because I was paralyzed,
burning, like drinking

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
battery acid, on
fire, and blind.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't do
anything to this place.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:84%
When you acclimate yourself
to this blue-grey place

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and then you move down
a tunnel, you usually

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.972 align:middle line:84%
hear a series of chimes, or
you cross a meadow, something

00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that psychologically
represents a change.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Loved
ones there for you?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.411 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Everybody you've
ever loved and everything

00:26:08.411 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
you've ever loved comes
to greet you-- your pets,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:16.001 align:middle line:84%
your parakeets, you know,
dogs, cats, everything.

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: My frogs
I used to launch,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.365 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little
boy, in a rocket?

00:26:19.365 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:90%
They come back?

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.448 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, they'll be
patting their feet and making

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.777 align:middle line:84%
those croaking noises, because
of what you did to them.

00:26:24.777 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
thought, wouldn't you

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.737 align:middle line:90%
hate to die on the day--

00:26:27.737 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They didn't die.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They came back.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.075 align:middle line:90%
They were alive.

00:26:30.075 --> 00:26:30.991 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, OK.

00:26:30.991 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They floated down.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Oh, well, then
you don't have to worry.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll be happy
to see you, George.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you imagine the
stories they told their little

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:90%
pond friends?

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.406 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Think about it.

00:26:39.406 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This guy kept put me
in a rocket shut me up 1,200

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:90%
feet.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what they'll say.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.633 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I think
that's wonderful,

00:26:44.633 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:90%
because you think about this.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you hate to die the
day that a Nebraska dairy

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
farmer passes, and all those
cows are there to greet him,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to get your
loved ones, dodging cows.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when you meet your
loved ones it's a reunion,

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a celebration, and to
know that there is continuity

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
within the context of
this next adventure.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you have, George, what
is absolutely, unequivocally,

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
the most important issue of
the near-death experience.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks dying or
not dying is the issue.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:90%
That's crap.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:84%
You will see your entire
life pass before you

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:90%
in a 360 degree panorama.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.745 align:middle line:84%
And you will realize that you
missed absolutely nothing.

00:27:28.745 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if think you're
a know-it-all now,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:90%
wait till you're dead.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a
sudden, you encapsulate

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
everything, every
entity, everything.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you see this
panoramic review--

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and I always use this
term-- you know how many

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
hairs was in the nose
of the doctor who

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:90%
pulled you from your mother.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You have missed absolutely
nothing of this life.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But you chose to come,
and we chose to come,

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you have a specific mission,
and you focused on that mission.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you literally
see the panorama.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you literally watch
it from a second person

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.160 align:middle line:90%
This is the life review.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It happens to everybody.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is, you
don't see what you did wrong.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You see the choices
you had to make,

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.124 align:middle line:84%
and how close you
got to the right one.

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Not that you did wrong, because
there's not a whole lot of

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:90%
did wrong over there.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.512 align:middle line:84%
It's, let's look at it as a
great, powerful, and mighty

00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
spiritual being with dignity,
direction, and purpose,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and you, yourself,
personally look at.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
point of this is

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to review this life to
see what you achieved.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, you literally
become every person

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever encountered.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the direct
results of your interaction

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:90%
between you and them.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.091 align:middle line:84%
I had to see-- my first
panoramic life review, George.

00:28:44.091 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That must
have scared you.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that when we come

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.467 align:middle line:90%
right back on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:54.684 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:28:54.684 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.391 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've got a
live studio audience.

00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I think, next time, I
should have a live studio

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.271 align:middle line:90%
band in here.

00:29:01.271 --> 00:29:02.020 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, Leno
has one, Letterman has one,

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:90%
why don't I have one?

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.949 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I think so.

00:29:06.949 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Hey look, the opportunity
of us, in our age group

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and the age group just beyond
us, just younger than us,

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and just a little older, they
are searching for answers.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the main issues
is end of life care.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Look what you said.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
How many of those classmates--
I graduated with 371 people,

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:90%
and 46 of them are gone.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, amazing.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I lost 10 people
since January, family, aunts,

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:90%
uncles, OK?

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's in the field
of learning and facing death.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so proud, thanks
for having me on this show.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I try to
drive away so people

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
get a chance to see what is
happening, how to look at it.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:90%
My biggest deal is this.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
If it's not funny
it's not spiritual.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to talk to me
about death and the other side,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not making me
laugh, based on what I know

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and what I've seen.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
First, you're funny
and ill informed.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So in the end of the point of
once you become every person,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the direct results
of your interaction between you

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else, you have
to come to two conclusions.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the most powerful
thing about that?

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness, and this is
a fair and just universe.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.332 align:middle line:84%
When you know it's a
fair and just universe,

00:30:24.332 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:84%
you know it's a level playing
field, no matter what anybody

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
says, how much
conspiracy is going on,

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a level playing universe.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that, the
power of forgiveness means,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:84%
why in the world would I get
between you and something

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
you did to me when I know
you're going to have to be me?

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And most of my stuff
was bad, George.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to go and be
people I had beat up and shot.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And [GUTTURAL NOISE] just
growing up as an insane person.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But the next two
near-death experiences,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I could see that
I have improved.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to the
great book of records,

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the hall of records, the akashic
records, the book of judgement

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
that everyone talks about.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.037 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is one.

00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who reads it
to you in that state?

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: See
how great that is?

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.859 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think knows
more about you than you?

00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just you.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.775 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: You've got it.

00:31:18.775 --> 00:31:22.784 align:middle line:84%
There ain't Saint Peter or God
standing there with a magazine.

00:31:22.784 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's all--

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.181 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hey, Dannion,
this thing you did in 1804.

00:31:26.181 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, you
know, you blew your nose.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who believes
all that stuff?

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:90%
That's just crazy.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.470 align:middle line:90%
You judge you.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And what you do
is, you look back

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
over the panoramic life
review, the choices

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:90%
and then the interaction.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you seeing
glimpses of your past life?

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.195 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: No,
you are seeing--

00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.727 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen a past life.

00:31:47.727 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'm telling you
now is exactly what happened.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This life?

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And is it, like, on video?

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: It's
even more than that.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:90%
You are living in it.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You are participating
and connected to it.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The great lesson of
over there, George,

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is you are a part of
it, but you are also

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
recognized as it
being a part of you.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.705 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons we choose to
try to come to the earth life

00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:17.901 align:middle line:90%
is we can hug.

00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:18.525 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:18.525 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: We can appear
and feel like we're separate.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's a rare gift
for a spiritual being.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to
the book of judgment,

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:90%
this is the Dannion perspective.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is what guides my life.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I used the term God,
or divine, or ultimate one,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.520 align:middle line:84%
If I could comprehend
what it was,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be worth knowing,
as big a fool as I am.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's true.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But if God couldn't come today,
and God sent you, in the life

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.385 align:middle line:84%
you just reviewed, what
difference does God make?

00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, the difference
that I saw in me,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
based on having so many
of these panoramic life

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
reviews till it gets depressing,
is I could be at the bedside.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I can listen and
help you find closer.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I can create an organization
called the Twilight Brigade.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can drive people
to come and learn

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
the art of being present and
listening, because everybody

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:90%
needs to be heard.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And this event, in
this new book, George,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
called "10 Things to
Know Before You Go,"

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
it's my new book for Harper,
"10 Things You Need to Know

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.106 align:middle line:84%
Before You Go; Aspire to
Inspire Before you Expire."

00:33:29.106 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That's
the name of it.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is,
you want to create a guide,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.140 align:middle line:84%
a way to observe, and get
reinforced in the process.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The first page of
the book it says,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
what's the number one
cause of death in America

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and most other countries?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:90%
That's all it says.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.427 align:middle line:84%
You turn the page
and it says, birth.

00:33:51.427 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, from
the moment you're born.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Birth is the
number one cause of death.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:84%
You turn to the next page
and it says remember,

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're breathing,
you're leaving.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you just took a
breath, this book is for you.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So what I want to
do is take people into a place,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.506 align:middle line:84%
we got to get over it,
because you got to help

00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
your grandmother, your brother,
your sisters, your aunts,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.780 align:middle line:90%
your uncles, your classmates.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:90%
You have to be knowledgeable.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.489 align:middle line:84%
And if you can ease
into it as a caregiver,

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
compassionate, if you

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:84%
can ease into it as a caregiver,
you not only lose your fear,

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.489 align:middle line:90%
you help people in situations.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Some will have
near-death experiences

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:84%
and come back and
tell you about them.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But others, people
need to be heard.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:90%
So they find and lose the fear.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
And then we break
the medical paradigm

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that is keeping people alive
long past their time to go.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And then once we
get a way to look

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:84%
at this thing we
call death, we can

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
create ways to open up to
broader aspects of what's

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:90%
going on in our life.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this new book because
I'm sick and tired of death.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:57.434 align:middle line:90%
I'm breathing.

00:34:57.434 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.267 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: It's about living.

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, if there's 10 things
you need to know before you go,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:90%
what's the book about?

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.010 align:middle line:90%
It's about life.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you a believer
that what you do in this life

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
comes back to you
10-fold in future lives?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Or wherever?

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, I absolutely
believe that without any

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.035 align:middle line:84%
question, because it's
a byproduct of realizing

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
you're a great, powerful, and
mighty spiritual being with

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.044 align:middle line:90%
dignity, direction, and purpose.

00:35:24.044 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You were that
before you got here.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You'll be that
while you're here.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be that
when you leave here.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Now here is the opportunity
mess it up a little bit,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
which I'm the best
there is at it.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know about
reincarnation, George.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:84%
When I sit here, before
you and this audience,

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
what I'm talking
about, about death.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This life.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I know it.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
You cannot, after 37 years
of being in end of life care,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing hospice
before I came here,

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and I lost a 37-year-old Navy
guy who weighed 62 pounds.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I watched what
he was going through.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.089 align:middle line:84%
And that I know my way and I
understand these principles.

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
well, Dannion, do you

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
tell them about the
near-death experience?

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe one out of 40.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not about me.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's about them finding
ways to appreciate

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that their life was well lived.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So that they can go
in peace and comfort.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'll know how to go
from this world to the next.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Someone always comes.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:90%
You're not ever left alone.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And once you get comfortable
with this, what we can do

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.505 align:middle line:84%
is explore everything
else without fear.

00:36:32.505 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
What people can do, and you
can look at art forms of life

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to improve it, I want people to
get the most out of this life.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Because, like you said, I
know when you get over there,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
based on the panoramic
life review, where

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.915 align:middle line:84%
you get to go on vacation
after you've done your duty--

00:36:51.915 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: This is
like serving nine years.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is like six years
in the Marine Corps.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're on a mission.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
finished with the job,

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
based on how well you achieved
your goal, where you get to go,

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.100 align:middle line:84%
where you get to explore--
so when you say, you know,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go to
heaven or hell-- well

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.581 align:middle line:90%
I never got to hell.

00:37:16.581 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So all I know is it's
like Genesis says,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:90%
there're seven heavens.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've seen four of them.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'm going to try
to do a good job at being

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:84%
at the bedside
and helping people

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:84%
reduce their fear of death
and empower their life.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it
happens to someone

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
they're close to, they can
be the greatest caregiver,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
using the art form called
the Twilight Brigade,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.445 align:middle line:84%
to help that person go from
this side to the other.

00:37:41.445 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you feel as
if you're giving back now?

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Does it make you feel good?

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.371 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, it keeps
me out of trouble, George.

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:50.950 align:middle line:84%
If I stay at the bedside,
I can't start but so much--

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can't be doing
whatever you were doing.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.235 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, what
else my mind goes to.

00:37:54.235 --> 00:37:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have an obsessive
compulsive personality.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to continuously
be stimulated.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And conversations,
perfect example.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a guy that
no one talks to him.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
He's mean as hell, OK?

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.389 align:middle line:84%
So I get all the
people who are bad.

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You get to him.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: No, all my
Twilighter guys make me a list

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:90%
of who's the bad guys.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.480 align:middle line:90%
I go there.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy, mean,
aggravated, and I stand there

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, I know
exactly how you feel.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I act like that
most of the time.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, but tell me who you are.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:90%
And this exchange game--

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He starts opening up.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: And he starts
to see being appreciated.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.565 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was in North
Africa, a black gentleman,

00:38:39.565 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in North Africa
and he was a cook.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And a guy in his bathrobe
came out and said,

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:90%
is this your Jeep?

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.018 align:middle line:90%
And he's delivering potatoes.

00:38:48.018 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, take those
potatoes out and take me

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:90%
to my tent.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So he did it, looked
like an officer.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It was George S. Patton.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And this was George
S. Patton's driver.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hahaha.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: From
Sicily to Berlin.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What history.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: My God, George,
I'm hearing stories of Patton

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:84%
in a 1939 Willis Jeep,
in a battlefield,

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.580 align:middle line:84%
with our little Sherman
tanks against Panzer Tigers.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's riding in the middle
of dodging bullets in a field

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.386 align:middle line:90%
with this guy driving the Jeep.

00:39:24.386 --> 00:39:26.863 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, and this
guy is opening up to you,

00:39:26.863 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
and he's become a nice guy.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Not only
that, somebody cared.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Somebody wanted to
listen to his story.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And someone like me, I mean,
all of the great battles.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And to listen to that, and
that's what I get back.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You showed you cared.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for you, Dannion,

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:90%
from our audience.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.735 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:39:48.735 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Dannion, you've
got a very positive attitude

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:90%
on the afterlife.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with it.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Maurice
Rawlings, in 1993,

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.220 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "To Hell
and Back," and his research

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.660 align:middle line:90%
on the near-death experiences.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people had
quite a different take

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.226 align:middle line:90%
on the afterlife.

00:40:09.226 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Are you familiar with that?

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.494 align:middle line:90%
And what is your opinion?

00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:14.785 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's not all fun
and games on the other side.

00:40:14.785 --> 00:40:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah, it is.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.539 align:middle line:90%
Look, George.

00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The devil made
you say that, didn't he?

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.975 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well,
you know, hey.

00:40:22.975 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I just had to see what the
paycheck was, you know.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, isn't there
a place where evil goes?

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Let's hope so.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:90%
But let me tell you something.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
panoramic life review,

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:36.140 align:middle line:84%
you've got to remember, as long
as you exist in this paradigm,

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, then there is
a transitory place.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I call it the blue-grey place.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
It's where people float
above and look and watch.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The first two times I was
in the blue-grey place,

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
13 years apart, I thought
I was the only one there.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Which is how I think
about everything, anyway.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.595 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the only one
there, you know,

00:40:53.595 --> 00:40:55.600 align:middle line:90%
it's, everything's about me.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.614 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
this was another realm,

00:40:58.614 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that there were levels
of consciousness.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it in
"Secrets of the Light."

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have to go
down the tunnel as long as

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
you're dimensionally
connected to the earth plane.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you go down the
tunnel, that life review

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:90%
is hell enough.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:84%
That life review, from a
powerful, mighty, spiritual

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Good or bad, it's
got to be pretty strong.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: A
creation of the divine.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Ultimate love and compassion,
integrity, honesty, and honor--

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:84%
there are no other functions
once you see yourself

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:90%
in that realm.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:84%
To see the stupid stuff
you do in the name of ego.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It's never what you
do, it why you do it.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.236 align:middle line:84%
So as I look at the
near-death experiences, sir,

00:41:43.236 --> 00:41:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't
give us your name.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mike.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: As I look at
the near-death experiences,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:84%
like we said earlier, I have
lived in it for 37 years.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.319 align:middle line:84%
I know every major
researcher in the world.

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I know them, I look
at their studies.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I look at their information.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Because every person
is individual.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 3% of all
near-death experiences

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:90%
are hellish experiences.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But the place that you go
is that in between world.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:84%
That place where you're
caught up, still, in you.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus have a name
for it, the Tibetans

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.099 align:middle line:90%
have a name for it.

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:19.015 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did we call
it purgatory in our day?

00:42:19.015 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, the
Catholics call it purgatory.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's a place.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And until you decide to
let go of all those issues,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that ego-driven or like, I
was thinking about Hitler,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:90%
someone asked me about Hitler.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Where would Hitler go?

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm pretty sure he
stayed in the blue-grey place

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:84%
a while so he could keep on
doing whatever he thought

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.080 align:middle line:84%
was right, because
he had that mindset.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.705 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: But once you get
down that tunnel and you have

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
a life review and you're going
to be everybody you've ever

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:84%
encountered, he has six
million people he tortured.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.809 align:middle line:90%
He's still there.

00:42:57.809 --> 00:42:59.558 align:middle line:84%
He's still being
everyone of those people.

00:42:59.558 --> 00:43:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's his torture?

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That's everybody's
Hell, but let me finish,

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:90%
can I finish this?

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right, go ahead.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.529 align:middle line:90%
And we'll take one more.

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: So about 3% of
the cases that I've seen,

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.940 align:middle line:84%
which is probably about 40, I
can, right away and understand,

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2%, drugs, chemical
reactions, type of reaction,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:23.180 align:middle line:84%
some shock, and a basic
mental/spiritual concept

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.790 align:middle line:90%
of their reality.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a 1/2%,
I have no idea.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Or are setup as psychologies,
but basically, none of you

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.570 align:middle line:90%
are going to hell.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if I didn't go, you
don't have a chance at it.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You can absolutely
forget it as a concept,

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and let love and compassion
and joy and kindness drive you.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the greatest
reward when you are everybody

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:90%
you've ever encountered.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.701 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, Dannion,
you hug everybody.

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, who do you
think I'm hugging?

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Me.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when I get
on the other side,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I have 15 million hugs to
go through before I even

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with some of
that crap I got myself into.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you going to have
anybody on the other side that

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:90%
you hope you don't see?

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.625 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Long as I'm only
other side, I don't care.

00:44:19.625 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Because you see, George, watch.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's my personality and
people dealing with me.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.290 align:middle line:90%
I have a joyous sense about it.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I see the most horrible
transitions on earth.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:34.790 align:middle line:90%
And I see it every day.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And I see some of the greatest.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not funny,
it's not spiritual.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.876 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't see
the joy in this life,

00:44:42.876 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and whatever is stopping
you from not seeking

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.540 align:middle line:84%
this joy in this
life, you are doing

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.877 align:middle line:90%
your own self an injustice.

00:44:48.877 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I want people to get that.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.880 align:middle line:84%
We live in a changing
world of insanity.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It is changing so fast
that we don't really

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
see how quickly it's
changing around us.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:90%
$16 trillion?

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Who in the hell's going to
pay $16 trillion, George?

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
When did this even
come into existence?--

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:84%
1946, Dumbarton
Oaks in Brentwood.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
choice but to change.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.899 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
choice but to embrace.

00:45:12.899 --> 00:45:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And if we embrace the
identity of ourselves

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.780 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings, death
will be the first, then pain,

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and then without fear we
can make the right decisions

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.050 align:middle line:84%
collectively, together
as spiritual beings,

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:84%
to transform the world
that we're living in,

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.440 align:middle line:90%
or we will be in world war.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're at the precipice
of world peace or world war.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You are an example
of why the other side is well

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:84%
worth looking at,
every once in while.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Thank you, George.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.371 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're coming back,
final segment with Dannion

00:45:39.371 --> 00:45:40.903 align:middle line:90%
Brinkley on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:40.903 --> 00:45:45.221 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:45:45.221 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we're
with Dannion Brinkley.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Dannion in December of
2011, I lost my father.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.020 align:middle line:90%
He had fallen.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:84%
He was 88 years old,
World War II veteran.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Broke his neck.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Never complained.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in St Louis
and LA, he's in Detroit.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.010 align:middle line:84%
My mother started seeing his
neck swelling and swelling

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:90%
a week or so later.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.355 align:middle line:84%
And so she brought
him into the doctor.

00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, he's
going right into the hospital.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So they put him in the
hospital and they x-rayed him.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And while he was in bed
listening to the doctor talking

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to my sisters and my
mother, the doctor said,

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
operate on him to fix it.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
his throat, in the front,

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and try to repair this
severed bone back there.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:84%
He heard that and
decided to leave.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: I am out of here.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He died,
just like that.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.366 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I am blowing
this popsicle stand.

00:46:38.366 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have
always wondered,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:90%
he seemed to go peaceably.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you
think about, no one

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.797 align:middle line:90%
ever thinks about themselves.

00:46:48.797 --> 00:46:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The first thing a
person thinks about,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:84%
George, is who you can
control, because you're

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.400 align:middle line:90%
losing your ability.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The three reasons
for suicide, there's

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:84%
three reasons-- improper pain
management, loss of dignity,

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:04.660 align:middle line:90%
a burden on the family.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: OK.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.780 align:middle line:84%
He thought, was it
going to be painful?

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.149 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 88 years old
and I lived this long.

00:47:12.149 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm not going
to go through that.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.398 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Second, what am
I going to put my wife through

00:47:16.398 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and my daughters through?

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I go
through it, then what

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.160 align:middle line:84%
are the risks, improper
pain management.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:25.960 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And then, burden on the family.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.380 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual being
ranges those three.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll see if there's
anybody they need to see.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I saw a woman with
leukemia that there

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle line:84%
was no possible way
she could be alive,

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.365 align:middle line:84%
and lived 55 days on a
half a glass of water

00:47:41.365 --> 00:47:42.870 align:middle line:84%
a day until her
sister got there,

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:90%
so that they could have closure.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And then she died.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean the 20 minutes, 55 days.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.944 align:middle line:84%
So Pop, you know,
he's laying back.

00:47:49.944 --> 00:47:51.110 align:middle line:90%
George is doing pretty good.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.440 align:middle line:90%
The daughter's doing good.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I see the daughter knowing this
is going to take care of momma.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, I am out of here.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.060 align:middle line:90%
You are in control.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.480 align:middle line:84%
You think you're not
in control, but you

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.500 align:middle line:84%
can go to any emergency
room or intensive care unit

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and you can ask any
doctor or any nurse

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
or any orderly in there
about who's in control.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.925 align:middle line:84%
What we get caught
up in, George,

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
is all those systems of
what you've got to do.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to keep
them alive forever.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do all
that kind of stuff.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And dad, that's the man from
the greatest generation.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
just cool, George.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
something else--

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not supposed be
in the Swami business--

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.280 align:middle line:90%
but I can sense his presence.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I can sense him, influences
you in books and things

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're writing
about communication.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Because Edison thought
about communication.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the next 20 years, we
will have communication devices

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
that will be able to
achieve that as we break

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.920 align:middle line:84%
through the Higgs Boson
particle concept in CERN

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:90%
in the accelerator.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Once we move to
sub-sub-subatomic,

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
where neutrinos are broken down
into their three basic wave

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:84%
particles, which is where
we are now in science,

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not in
Newtonian mechanics.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We're in wave particle
dimensional, psychological,

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and physiological
quantum concepts.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Once we do that, we will
pass through the veil.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.640 align:middle line:90%
The veil is very thin.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency in harmonics.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Those seven tones that
I heard, you know,

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.250 align:middle line:90%
there are seven tones.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them is
a frequency transition

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that my body
reverberates and lets

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.340 align:middle line:84%
go of material aspect
concepts and enters

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.850 align:middle line:90%
ethereal spiritual concepts.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.520 align:middle line:90%
So dad hung around.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We'll be
talking to them.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.114 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it's not a
long distance phone call.

00:49:46.114 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, it depends
on the frequency modulation.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:53.245 align:middle line:84%
Look at AM and FM, which
is now digital compression.

00:49:53.245 --> 00:49:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I mean,
it's instant, is global.

00:49:56.975 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, I don't think
it's ever going to be possible.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I can take my cell phone out,
I can take a picture of you,

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and I can send it to a
friend of mine in China.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.880 align:middle line:84%
From right here, click,
put in my pocket,

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.771 align:middle line:84%
in less than three
seconds he has you.

00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:84%
If that's possible, think
about where Dick Tracy would

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.710 align:middle line:84%
be today with that stupid
two-way wrist radio.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.020 align:middle line:84%
If that's possible
that that can happen,

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.560 align:middle line:84%
to believe that we
could communicate

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.420 align:middle line:84%
with other dimensions,
look at CERN, George.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Look at this collider.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.550 align:middle line:84%
They can take a neutrino,
which is a particle that you

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:37.580 align:middle line:84%
can measure, you can add a
tachyon nano transmitter, which

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:84%
is an even smaller
particle called a tachyon

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and you can attach an
identifier onto it.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you can bombard
it with electrons.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And it will leave
this dimension.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:90%
It will leave it.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:53.225 align:middle line:90%
It'll go.

00:50:53.225 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, what does that
tell you about what happens

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.200 align:middle line:90%
to us?

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.116 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: But what?

00:50:57.116 --> 00:51:00.100 align:middle line:84%
At the moment you
release that bombardment,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.540 align:middle line:90%
the same neutrino comes back.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It went somewhere outside
of basic physics concepts.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.975 align:middle line:84%
And because it had a
tachyon marker on it,

00:51:10.975 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:90%
you know it's the same neutron.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Well think about
what it does for us.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.510 align:middle line:90%
We are neutrons.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.060 align:middle line:90%
We are neutrons and electrons.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you pass, you
change your frequency.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.010 align:middle line:90%
You change your frequency.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to come back, the
hardest part about coming back

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is how we deal with
those who are gone.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, do you think mother's OK?

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm depressed, she left me.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You think I'm going to
come back from heaven

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.759 align:middle line:90%
to prove to you that I'm OK?

00:51:40.759 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You
can forget all that.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're gone.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: You better
be cheerful and stuff,

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and I might show up.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, how do you
explain hauntings and things

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.410 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: The
blue-grey place.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.442 align:middle line:84%
I never believed any of that
stuff, and I was dead twice.

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I never believed any of that.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the third near-death
experience, after 22 years,

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
before I ever stayed
in the blue-grey place.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, I spent 41
hours in recovery,

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.330 align:middle line:84%
George, because I was so
obsessively compulsive

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:07.560 align:middle line:90%
about this blue-grey place.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I had already
been down a tunnel,

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.844 align:middle line:84%
and had the panoramic
life review.

00:52:10.844 --> 00:52:12.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'd already seen heaven.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, damn, where
in the world it this?

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.850 align:middle line:90%
And you could see veterans.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Why I created the Twilight
Brigade is veterans

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.210 align:middle line:90%
were trapped.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:90%
They felt betrayed.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.840 align:middle line:90%
They were in prison camps.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And they kept wandering
through prison camps and war

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and battlefields and
all those things.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And I saw them trapped.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I created the
Twilight Brigade

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:84%
so that I could train
people to help people cross.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Once they got to
the other side, they

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.300 align:middle line:90%
could help those in between.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Because this is how it operates.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.547 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see
hauntings and ghosts,

00:52:46.547 --> 00:52:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I never believed in any of that.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I listened to
people tell those stories.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like you and I when
we're at a convention, when

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.300 align:middle line:84%
you sit around at the end
and everybody's a Swami.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the Swami
business in some field.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I used to listen to
all that, you know?

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But once I saw the
blue-grey place--

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about in "Secrets"--
I realized what ghosts are,

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.350 align:middle line:84%
why they stay, that they
have a valuable presence

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
the in-between world.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:84%
They can enter this world based
on the thoughts and emotions

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.650 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, it has to
do that we either were afraid of

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.490 align:middle line:84%
or we liked some
pattern of behavior.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at abuse.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think domestic
violence and abuse

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.024 align:middle line:90%
becomes almost--

00:53:30.024 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Commonplace.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.064 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: --commonplace.

00:53:32.064 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
attracting fields

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of energy of people who were
so used to it, that they didn't

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:90%
want to go down the tunnel.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
They were so connected to
it as abusers and abusees

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that that energy
flows back over here

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:47.100 align:middle line:84%
as a pattern when
those people set.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.665 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is that
tunnel that you talk about,

00:53:49.665 --> 00:53:51.580 align:middle line:90%
that so many people talk about?

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, I've
looked at black holes, quarks,

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.800 align:middle line:90%
quantum dynamic theory.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a methodology,
because most people it's

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel, some it's a
bridge, some it's a meadow,

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:08.810 align:middle line:90%
it's a boundary.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But most people, I mean,
from Tibet, it's a tunnel.

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a spinning
energetic field

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that we pass through
as we release

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.590 align:middle line:90%
the mental, physical self.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's moving,
whether I was moving or not.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.500 align:middle line:90%
It was changing color.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was colors
that I had never seen.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And I could hear these tones.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And each tone, I would become
more focused in that world,

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.820 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the
one I had left.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I got
to the end of the tunnel

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:44.340 align:middle line:84%
in this blue-grey
place, I was aware

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.034 align:middle line:84%
that I was somewhere
completely different

00:54:48.034 --> 00:54:48.950 align:middle line:90%
from where I was left.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.158 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know I was dead.

00:54:50.158 --> 00:54:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.330 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't hit you right away.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BRINKLEY: It's nonsense.

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the near-death
experience, George.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.430 align:middle line:84%
You're having a
near-death experience.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Every breath you take
is the way of knowing

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:03.740 align:middle line:84%
you're having a
near-death experience.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.114 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've been
known to die on the air before.

00:55:06.114 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, I
have never heard it.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But over there is
the life experience.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.340 align:middle line:84%
When you quit breathing,
you become alive--

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.894 align:middle line:90%
when you quit breathing.

00:55:18.894 --> 00:55:20.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
things I learned,

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:27.080 align:middle line:84%
George, is that people don't
know when something spiritually

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.080 align:middle line:90%
ethereal happens.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.950 align:middle line:84%
It happens when you breathe
in and there is a place

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:37.320 align:middle line:84%
before you breathe out
that your breath stops.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.137 align:middle line:84%
Like there is a space
in between each word.

00:55:40.137 --> 00:55:42.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, when you breathe in,
you breathe in everything

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
around you, colors,
hues, energies.

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.060 align:middle line:90%
You analyze it.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.840 align:middle line:84%
It touches the divine in
your eight sinus cavities

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.930 align:middle line:90%
in that one moment.

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And the action you take
when you breathe out

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:52.562 align:middle line:90%
is how you transform the world.

00:55:52.562 --> 00:55:54.561 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, you
breathe in for you and out

00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:55.760 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual involvement.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.447 align:middle line:84%
You don't throw a
punch breathing in.

00:55:57.447 --> 00:55:58.780 align:middle line:90%
You throw a punch breathing out.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you came
back, this tough Marine,

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.900 align:middle line:84%
who was not a good
person, as you'll admit,

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.420 align:middle line:90%
what made you change?

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: That I saw that
when I was going to be every

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:84%
person I had ever encountered,
why was I hitting my own self

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.770 align:middle line:90%
in the face?

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.690 align:middle line:84%
If I'm seeing the
damage I'm doing--

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.389 align:middle line:84%
that's why I like
forgiveness-- I'm not

00:56:23.389 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:84%
going to get between
you and what's coming.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.013 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you do
this to yourself, then?

00:56:27.013 --> 00:56:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Did you cure yourself?

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: Well, wisdom
and knowledge is the greatest

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.230 align:middle line:90%
bearer of change.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And if I went through
it the first time,

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I realized that by the time
that 13 years had passed,

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.940 align:middle line:84%
it was time that
they kill me again,

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.343 align:middle line:90%
because I resent hypocrisy.

00:56:44.343 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: I cannot
stand-- the most fierce word

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in my language now
is tacky, you know,

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
where it was about
nine four-letter words,

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.860 align:middle line:90%
now it's tacky.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're tacky
and you're a hypocrite,

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.660 align:middle line:84%
idle in hypocrisy, I don't
want anything to do with it.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And you anger me.

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're watching
happen is based on an illusion.

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The physical, mental
state is an illusion.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Science can prove today
that nobody is in this room.

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But what it doesn't
do-- it does it

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:18.790 align:middle line:84%
science, chemical--
not energetic.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Because now with
quantum physics,

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.630 align:middle line:84%
energetically, we
are in this room.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.310 align:middle line:90%
We are not just chemistry.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.260 align:middle line:84%
They've proven that they
think they're right,

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.930 align:middle line:84%
because they create
drugs and they give us

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.570 align:middle line:84%
identity of the
mental/physical self.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But there is a spiritual self
that's-- physical matter is 99%

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:40.510 align:middle line:90%
percent empty space.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're just a
big bag of water.

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you tried to look
at yourself physically,

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.970 align:middle line:84%
you realize that you're just
basically a water treatment

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:47.470 align:middle line:90%
plant.

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Dannion get out your website,
author of "Saved By the Light."

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.900 align:middle line:84%
New book, what's the
title going to be?

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> BRINKLEY: "10 Things
to Know Before You Go."

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's just dannion.com.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Or just punch d-a-n-n-i-o-n.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And you will find,
probably, one of the most

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.210 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, insane
people that you've ever

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.199 align:middle line:84%
had the privilege
to hang out with.

00:58:07.199 --> 00:58:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, everybody,
for being a part.

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:10.445 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Dannion Brinkley.

00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my friend.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.265 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:58:14.265 --> 00:58:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, I've had the
pleasure of talking to Dannion

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.850 align:middle line:84%
for years now on
"Coast to Coast" radio,

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and now on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Every time I talk
to him, he just

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.540 align:middle line:84%
amazes me about his
caring, his energy

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:84%
in helping us
understand just what

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.450 align:middle line:90%
could be on the other side.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:34.410 align:middle line:90%
