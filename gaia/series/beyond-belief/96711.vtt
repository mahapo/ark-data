>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.408 align:middle line:90%

>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:10%
All of us at some
time in our life

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:10%
have tried to ask ourselves
that question, who are we?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on "Beyond
Belief," Gregg Braden.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Gregg is an author, a
researcher, and an explorer.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
One of his latest
works, of course,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
called "Deep Truth," trying to
find out just where in the heck

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.764 align:middle line:84%
we came from and what
we're doing here.

00:00:50.764 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: I can't think
of a more important question

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:90%
to answer, George.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:10%
You know, the key to the way
that we solve our problems

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:10%
and the way we think of
ourselves in the world-- it's

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:10%
all based in the way that
we have been led to believe,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:10%
what our relationship is
to ourselves, to our body,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
to the world around us, to
our past, to our future.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's so very
fascinating to me

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is that in the
modern world, we've

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
been steeped in a story,
a scientific story.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:90%
It's about 300 years old.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We say science began
about 300 years ago.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a story of separation.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And that story of
separation is the way

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have been taught
to think of ourselves

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and see the world around
us and solve our problems.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
If we want to see
the consequence

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
of doing precisely
that, it's the world

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:90%
that we have right now.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Some things are certainly
working better than others.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So what science has tried to
do is what our ancestors have

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:90%
done for thousands of years.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
There are a series
of questions are

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
called the perennial
questions of life.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors
have always believed

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
if they could answer these
fundamental questions,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that in answering each of them
individually, collectively,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.136 align:middle line:90%
we would have an answer--

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Makes sense.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --to help us--
to help us know who we are.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So the six questions essentially
in one variation or another,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
they begin at the very bottom
of an inverted pyramid.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:10%
We can think of it that way.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And the first question is
the most fundamental of all.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
What is the origin of life?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.569 align:middle line:84%
The second question is, what
is the origin of human life?

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
evidence suggesting that

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it may not come from where
the other life has come from.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The third question is, what is
our relationship to our bodies?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Are we separate and powerless
when it comes to our bodies

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
or are we somehow
deeply connected

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.444 align:middle line:84%
in ways that science is only
beginning to understand?

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The next question is,
what is our relationship

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:90%
to the world beyond our bodies?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Are we deeply connected to
the world that surrounds us,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
or are we separate and
independent from that world?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
The next question
after that is, what is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to the past?

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have been led to
believe-- the history books

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
today, our young
people in school,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
are taught that
civilization, for example,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
is about 5,000 years old.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It began 5,000,
5,5000 years ago.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And that there's
been a progression,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
a linear progression, that's
happened one time that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
culminates with us
and the sophistication

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the story
that we're being told.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And the last question
is, how do we

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
go about solving our problems
when times get tough?

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
When we're up against
the wall, do we

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%
cooperate or do we compete?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.865 align:middle line:10%
Well, for 300 years we say
that science-- modern science

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:10%
is born around the
time of Isaac Newton

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:10%
when they formalized the laws
of physics about 300 years ago.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We have been led to believe that
the answer to those questions,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
if our viewers can
visualize on the side

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of this inverted
pyramid, the origin,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
where do we come from--
we've been taught that we're

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
completely random and
the origin of life,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the origin of human life we're
taught, is completely random.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.724 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that we are
separate from our bodies.

00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:02.723 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that we are
separate from the world

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:90%
beyond our bodies.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that civilization
is a one time deal.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.624 align:middle line:84%
It's happened once
and that we're

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:90%
the pinnacle of sophistication.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're taught
that nature is based

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
upon this model of
competition and conflict.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.829 align:middle line:84%
That story of separation
has led to the world

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have to say it
has worked well enough,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
George, to get us
to where we are.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, the best science
of the 21st century-- and this

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:90%
is peer reviewed science.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the theory,
hypothesis, speculation.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Peer reviewed science
has now overturned

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
every one of those
statements that I just made.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that the story,
our story, our relationship

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to the world, is
a story based not

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
upon separation, but on
connection and cooperation.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that the physical
evidence does not

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
support that the origin of
life is completely random.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
The DNA evidence doesn't support
that the origin of human life

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
toss out Darwin?

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Right out the window?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm going to talk
about Darwin in just a minute.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a very important
part of what we're doing here.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't toss it out, but it
means it's a special case.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.754 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:13.754 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When it comes to our
relationship to our bodies,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.544 align:middle line:84%
our own science
now is telling us

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, feelings,
emotions, beliefs

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
create precise chemistry
within the brain that match

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:90%
each of those experiences.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.264 align:middle line:84%
And when we know how to
create those experiences,

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
we literally have our
own medicine chest

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
in our brain to create the
chemicals in our bodies.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're not separate
from our bodies.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The world around our
bodies, our quantum physics

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
now is telling us that we are
deeply connected to ourselves,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to one another, to
our world in ways

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
understood in their time

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're only beginning
to understand in ours.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to civilization,
the best science of our time--

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and I've had the opportunity
to physically document some

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
of the archaeological sites
now that are pushing the date

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of advanced technological
civilization--

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way back.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.257 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Back over
twice, almost three times

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
what we're being taught,
what our young people are

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:90%
being taught, in schools today.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
We're being taught that,
again, 5,000, 5,500

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:90%
years with ancient Sumeria.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
We're now looking at
ice age civilizations--

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
technological ice
age civilizations.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know, our
dear friend Michael Cremo--

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.755 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Long time believes that
mankind, intelligent mankind,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
goes back millions
of years in that we

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
might have obliterated ourselves
and started over again.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And this process just
goes on and on and on.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The data
now is supporting

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:90%
some of these theories.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a little
slow in catching up.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say the last
one, when we talk about nature,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the best science
of the 21st century

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.692 align:middle line:84%
is now telling us that nature is
based in a model of cooperation

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and what biologists
call mutual aid.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that violent
competition and conflict

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
happens and they
don't deny that.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But those are responses
to specific circumstances.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not the general
law of nature.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So now when we look at
this pyramid of these six

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:90%
perennial questions, who are we?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
We now are being shown
through peer reviewed

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
science a story of
cooperation and connection

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.445 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
separation of the past.

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:27.331 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me all the
time, they say, OK, Greg.

00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
We got it.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Darwin wasn't right 100%.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.742 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the archaeologists
weren't 100% right.

00:07:33.742 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
What difference does it
make, is what they say.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is
that we think of ourselves

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
through a lens.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We define ourselves--
consciously, subconsciously--

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:90%
through a lens of perceptions.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Science helps us with
those perceptions.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Our families, our
communities, our religions,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.067 align:middle line:84%
culture all help with
those perceptions.

00:07:57.067 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
now, George, it's

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:90%
a silent revolution.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's like an
earthquake that is rocking

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
the foundations of
everything that we've

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
been taught about us and our
relationship to the world.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The story just changed
from a story of separation

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to a story of connection
and cooperation.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So the way we go about
solving our problems,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.112 align:middle line:84%
and I think our
listeners all know

00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've got some big
problems to solve right now--

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The old solutions
don't seem to be working.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons may be
because those old solutions are

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
based on what are
called false assumptions

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:90%
of an obsolete science.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.211 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:90%
I was trained as a scientist.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I think science is good.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
In some respects, I think we've
asked too much of science.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Because all science can
do is give us the facts.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Science can give us information.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's human
experience that brings

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom that tells us how we
apply those facts to our lives.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I don't think
science tells you the how.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.667 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: No, it can't.

00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the why.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: No, it could
tell you the nuts and bolts

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:90%
of how things fit together.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, science is
telling us quantum physics,

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:90%
saying everything is connected.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are saying,
OK, we're connected.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're connected.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: How--

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This happened.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know why.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, there really
is very little controversy

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
as to the connection itself.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
The controversy now is coming
to what extent are we connected.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
How deep does that
connection go?

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
How much of a role do
we play consciously

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
in applying that
connection in our lives?

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening right
now, there's-- this is

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
so interesting to me-- is that
peer reviewed science now has

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
overturned 300
years of thinking.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And answering
the way that we think

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves on the one hand.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there is a-- I'm

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
going to say there's a
reluctance, in many cases

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
a flat out resistance to
sharing this in the mainstream.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thrilled to be
here with you today.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
In the mainstream,
mainstream media,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
mainstream documentaries,
mainstream classrooms,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
mainstream textbooks, we are
now teaching our young people

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
the very principles of false
assumptions of science,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
asking them to
solve the problems

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.575 align:middle line:84%
that we've created through
the same thinking that

00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
created the problems.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make
any sense at all.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of a battle is there

00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
between intelligent
design and Darwinism?

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There's a huge battle
between intelligent design

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and Darwinism.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one
of the places science

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:90%
is designed to serve us.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And in its purest
form, it can do that.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Science has been hijacked
in the modern world

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
through money, power,
ego, corporations.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I know you've talked about
that in many of your programs.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.376 align:middle line:84%
So Darwinism is
a perfect example

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of where we're seeing this.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Darwin put forth
a theory in 1859.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said very
clearly-- I have

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the original copies of
his text-- the original title,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
"The Origin of Species by Means
of Natural Selection." that's

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the title most of our
listeners know that book by.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what we know, yeah.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: OK.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:90%
That is not the full title.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the title was
relegated to the inside pages

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:90%
early in the 20th century.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would know that?

00:11:09.682 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, the
scholars know it very well.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the rest of the title,
"The Origin of Species by Means

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of Natural Selection."
and then it has the word,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:10%
"Or the Preservation of
Favored Races in the Struggle

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:10%
For Life."

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.175 align:middle line:10%
That's the rest of the title.

00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us a
very, very different feel

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:90%
for Darwin's work.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us two
things about Darwin.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
First, it tells us
he believed there

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:90%
were favored races, number one.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Number two, he believed
life is a struggle.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So every observation that
he made that he wrote about

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're now teaching
in our textbooks,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
he made those through his
preconceived ideas of struggle.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
He saw the struggle everywhere.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he a
believer in God?

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think he
believed in a higher power.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But he specifically said up
until 1859, those big questions

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that I've just
shared, they were all

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
answered by the church and
religious organizations.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And he did his very best.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I think he was a good scientist.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
He did his best to
take the first step

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.254 align:middle line:84%
to move us away from religion
when we go about answering

00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
those questions.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.221 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 155 years ago.

00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think it
was a good scientist.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:84%
However, and I just
want to be really clear.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.749 align:middle line:90%
People ask me this all the time.

00:12:21.749 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with what he did.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Where I think
Darwin went wrong is

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
that he made a generalization.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
He believed that
when he saw nature

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
in one place in one moment in
time in one part of the world,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
what he saw happening there
represented a rule that applies

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to all nature everywhere
all over the world

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and beyond, including us.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he didn't have
our kind of tools that we have.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: He didn't.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.328 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder how
his thought pattern would

00:12:49.328 --> 00:12:51.319 align:middle line:90%
be if he were around today.

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
Darwin was the first.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And I show this in the books.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, I am offering a
theory that will move us away

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.252 align:middle line:90%
from religion.

00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is
only the first step.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It was not meant
to last forever.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was willing
for his theory to fall.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, when my theory
falls, the discovery that

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
breaks my theory
becomes the new theory.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was willing for
his theories to fall.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.339 align:middle line:84%
The academia of today,
the academic institutions,

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are refusing
to allow his theories to fall.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
For example, he believed life
began with a single organism

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and evolved slowly over
long periods of time.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:90%
That was his original theory.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
about this before.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So he believes that there
would be fossil evidence that

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:90%
would support that.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So what science
did 1859, they were

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
so willing to embrace his ideas,
there wasn't a lot of scrutiny,

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of critique,
a lot of criticism.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%
They embrace the ides.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
They developed a model.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening
is that today,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists today-- and
I have friends in the field.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
conversations all the time

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.745 align:middle line:90%
in the universities.

00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
battles or conversations?

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, they're
conversations between us.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They're battles that
they're fighting

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:90%
within the institutions.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
thinking is, they're

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:84%
looking for fossil evidence to
fit into a preconceived model

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of this evolutionary
idea rather than allowing

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the fossil evidence to tell
the story that it's actually

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
telling.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And what the story is telling
is that evolution is a fact.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a geologist, I
could tell you that.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in
the fossil record.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It breaks down when
it comes to humans,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:90%
the evolutionary theory.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:90%
We appeared in these bodies--

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're just, like,
something totally separate.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We showed up on
Earth about 200,000 years ago,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to take
a skeleton of one of us

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago and if
it were in another chair

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
here next to us, except the
legs were little thicker,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and they think that maybe
because we ran more or walked

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:90%
more back then.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure, we
didn't have cars.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.993 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: You can't
tell them from us.

00:14:55.993 --> 00:14:57.535 align:middle line:10%
Our cranial size is the same.

00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:10%
The cranial capacity
is the same.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:10%
The body proportions
are the same.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:84%
We haven't changed
in 200,000 years.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's not Darwin's
idea of evolution.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.172 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know--

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a but here?

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I don't want to get
sidetracked on that right now.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
doing, and this

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is one example, is that we're
refusing to allow the evidence

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.742 align:middle line:90%
to tell the story.

00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
force the evidence.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Not you and me,
not our listeners,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
but academia in
general trying to force

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the evidence into a story
that the data simply

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What story,
what conclusion

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:90%
are they trying to reach?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That we have
evolved from lesser

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:90%
forms, more primitive forms.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little organisms
along that chain.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Perfect
example-- there was-- 1987,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
there's an amazing discovery
northern Europe in a cave.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:54.332 align:middle line:84%
Underground, they found the
body of a baby Neanderthal girl.

00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in Germany, they
call it "Neandertal."

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:90%
So they let me know.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.211 align:middle line:84%
They let me know it
was "Neandertal."

00:15:59.211 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
Cremo says all the time.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.572 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think most of
our listeners know that

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the textbooks say that
Neanderthal is our ancestor

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
that we've-- if you
look at the family tree.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.943 align:middle line:84%
1987, he found the body
of this baby girl, George.

00:16:12.943 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It was preserved so well.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said it almost
wasn't mummified.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't frozen.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't fossilized.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The term they used
was preserved.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:90%
The hair was preserved.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:90%
The fingernails were preserved.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The skin was preserved so
well that for the first time,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.652 align:middle line:90%
we had really good DNA--

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: --that we
could compare our

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:10%
supposedly our ancestor
to modern humans

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:10%
to see where we really
fit in this family tree.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:90%
It was 1987.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The results were not
published until the year 2000.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The very prestigious
journal "Nature,"

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:84%
March, 2000, volume 490, was an
amazing expose of the forensics

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:90%
data that came.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And they went to some of the
very high profile forensics

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.039 align:middle line:84%
labs that do the high
profile crime cases.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.289 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The best of the best.

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And one of them
was in the Netherlands,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I believe is where it was.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And three independent
labs look at the DNA.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line,
the last sentence

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.175 align:middle line:90%
of the last paragraph of--

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Each report.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.299 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --of the report,
I'll just cut to the chase.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It said there's not enough
similarity between our DNA

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
today and the Neanderthal
DNA to suggest that we

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:90%
evolved from the Neanderthals.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.289 align:middle line:90%
And beyond that--

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.913 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They're
actually showing now

00:17:33.913 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that not only do we
not descend from them,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that we shared the
Earth with them.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
We had Neanderthal boyfriends
and girlfriends, apparently,

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we were sharing
the Earth with them,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
we could not have
evolved from them.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So now that changes the whole
branch of the family tree.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:90%
We're not hearing much.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.971 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How intelligent was
that species, the Neanderthals?

00:17:54.971 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We believe they
were very intelligent.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.487 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of conscious burial, of
an afterlife, the consciousness

00:18:01.487 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of an afterlife, and the
things that they believed

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:90%
would be needed.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we
call them the humans

00:18:05.883 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:90%
of the time on this planet?

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I--
personally, I would not.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
something about us.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes
down to the DNA.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the DNA is really

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
beginning to show the difference
is human chromosome number 2

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.239 align:middle line:90%
is really where the action is.

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the difference.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's the largest
chromosome in our genome.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- the geneticists
themselves say it did not

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:90%
form by natural processes.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:90%
It could not have.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's what's called a
telomere to telomere fusion.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So the ends of two different
types of DNA were fused

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
together in a way that they
say cannot happen under natural

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is peer review.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.611 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you say it doesn't

00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
happen under natural processes,
what does that then give us?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's where--

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the alternative?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's
where they stop.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
They said, we have to
stop, the scientists.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:90%
We must stop here.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Because to go farther than
that would be speculating.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.905 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
geneticists are saying

00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:07.035 align:middle line:84%
in peer reviewed-- there's
a whole conference,

00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
an entire conference on
human chromosome number 2

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:90%
that was in Europe.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's not
natural, then it's designed.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: They can't say that.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They can't say that because
they don't have the proof.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons I believe,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
George, and this is me as
an independent scientist.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We have compartmentalized
our world

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it's
very difficult for us

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.825 align:middle line:84%
to make the connections that
really connect the dots, put

00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
the pieces together.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
We've compartmentalized
science as a perfect example.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We say we have geology,
biology, chemistry, physics.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.004 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call these
different facets of nature

00:19:47.004 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:84%
so that we're comfortable
studying them.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.044 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
at nature, nature

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:84%
does not make that
compartmentalization.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
And our ancestors didn't.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't separate science
from art, from everyday life,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:90%
from the spiritual realms.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And because they
did not, they were

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
able to cross boundaries
that we've created

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.872 align:middle line:90%
in helping to develop answers.

00:20:07.872 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
They weren't scientific
answers, but they

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.045 align:middle line:84%
were accurate answers
in terms of how we work

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and how the universe works.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
most recent images

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
from NASA using some
very high resolution

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
filters of what
the universe looks

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
like through the Shandra--

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:20:28.005 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Shandra
Space Telescope

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
is what it's called
where we think

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.039 align:middle line:84%
there's empty space
between stars and galaxies.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
galaxies everywhere.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, you use the.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Filters and they're all
connected through stuff.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looks like a
huge cobweb, a spider web.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly the language
that our ancestors used.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
They always talked about
the web of creation.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi in the desert
southwest, spider grandmother

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
emerged into this world and
wove her web of creation.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.995 align:middle line:84%
The great god Indra in the Hindu
traditions created the web.

00:21:01.995 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how
would they know?

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:90%
How would they know?

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.514 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
that's the thing.

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon knew of the Sirius
B that is invisible to us.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And they preserved
their knowledge

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of the existence of the star
Sirius B in a dance where they

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
dance, literally
dance, the orbits

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and the paths of
Sirius A and Sirius B

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.707 align:middle line:90%
together, the twin suns.

00:21:25.707 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know until
the 20th century.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they claim that
their ancestors came down

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
from above and
told them about it.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.839 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
of the principles

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
We've got this
lens of perception

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:90%
that we have been steeped in.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The way we think of ourselves,
the story of separation,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and now the
scientific discoveries

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
are giving us reasons to
think very, very differently.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So the biology of
Darwin is telling

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
us very, very clearly
the new science,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that nature is based upon
this model of cooperation

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and mutual aid.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And where I find
this so fasting,

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:08.107 align:middle line:84%
George, is that the archaeology
supports the biology.

00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:90%
So the discoveries--

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They go together.

00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --that are being
made of the archaeological

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
discoveries of civilizations
throughout the world are now

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:84%
supporting the ideas of
Darwin's-- post-Darwin

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:90%
cooperation.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, we're
now looking at

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
advanced technological
civilizations that

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:90%
go back in the last ice age.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Personally documented Caral
in northern Peru, for example.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We're told civilization
began 5,000 years ago.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:90%
That's when this one ended.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It ended when we're told
the advanced technological

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:90%
civilizations began.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were no walls--
no walls to protect

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:90%
the homes in the cities.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge site.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It's 150 acre site,
five pyramids, three

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
massive circular complexes.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thriving city.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.651 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: No evidence of
any weapons, no evidence

00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of any large scale war.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:84%
When we go back into all
of the other civilizations

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
prior to 5,000 years,
we see the same story.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.559 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe.

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Turkey.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --in Turkey.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very near
the Syrian border.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a tough place to get to
right now because of the war.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating-- it is
rewriting the history books.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10,000 years ago.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.575 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It now is being
dated-- they have not excavated

00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom, George.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is now being dated at
12,000 years before present.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But they feel it's actually
11 three to 11 five is what

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're pretty
comfortable with that?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.263 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: For the
level that they are,

00:23:38.263 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:84%
they say now when they get
down to the lower levels,

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
looking at 13,000 years.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is the
Gulf of Khambhat in India,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:90%
9,500 years old.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Chateau Jiahu, 9,000
years before present.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
The Great Sphinx--
7,000 to 9,000 years.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
If it were one site,
it would be an anomaly.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
is the anomalies

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
tell a new story.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the place.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The story
is that the history

00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have studied
from Sumeria forward--

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
so we've got Egypt, Greece,
Rome, the Inca, the Maya, all

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating-- that
is only the story

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of the most recent cycle of
human history, a 5,000 year

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the cycle prior to that,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
all of these other sites fall
within that 5,000 year cycle.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that there's
another one before that pushing

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
it back into the last ice age.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing to me is
that prior to our 5,000 year

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
cycle, there's no evidence
of war-- large scale war.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
No evidence of weapons--
you don't find the weapons.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.685 align:middle line:84%
You don't find the mass
graves, the mutilated bodies.

00:24:41.685 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The first evidence--

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Should we find that?

00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The first
evidence of large scale war

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is 5,000 years ago, Sumeria--
the beginning of our cycle.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of
those places, George,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:84%
where if you look
only at the evidence,

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll never
understand the story.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But when we begin to cross the
traditional boundaries that

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
separated the sciences--
so when we listen

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to the indigenous
elders, for example,

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
they told us very
clearly that our cycles

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:90%
are based in cycles of climate.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.129 align:middle line:84%
And when the climate
changed 5,000 years

00:25:13.129 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
ago very similar to
what we're seeing now--

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.836 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --that is when the
first large scale war occurred.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that time,
we lived in what

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
was called a golden age or
an age-- or a cycle of peace.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And the evidence supports that.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, either we have not found
the weapons and they do exist,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:90%
or those weapons never existed.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.127 align:middle line:84%
And for all the sites
in the different parts

00:25:35.127 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of the world-- from Asia
yo Africa, South America,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and North America--
I would think

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
we would've found it
somewhere if it existed.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So there is a growing consensus
that large scale war as we know

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:90%
it today began 5,000 years ago.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous
story matches that.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And it says, we come from a
cycle, a golden age of peace.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, that was the
big deal about 2012,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
it was the close of a 5,000
year cycle of darkness and war.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.806 align:middle line:84%
We now are in the beginning
of a new 5,000 year cycle.

00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And the question is--

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of darkness and war.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, the question
is, will we perpetuate

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:90%
what we have come from?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little buffer
in between each cycle.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a 36 year buffer.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.755 align:middle line:84%
So the 2012 cycle
actually ended the 1980.

00:26:19.755 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And it goes until 2016.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
2016 is the end of the no time
buffer between the cycles.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
For a 5,000 year cycle,
there's 36 year window of time,

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of transition-- so
from 1980 to 2016.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what's
happening in the world today,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the Kondratiev cycles, if-- I
don't know if our listeners are

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the theories
around the cycle theory--

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
it began as economic
theory, but it

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:84%
applies to so many other
facets of our lives--

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
tell us that we are now in a war
cycle that actually winds down

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:90%
in the year 2020.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
we must have war.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.405 align:middle line:84%
It means there's
a vulnerability--

00:27:02.405 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --for--

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in that window.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We're in that window.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that
would be the opportunity

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to take extra precautions,
extra care when we're

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
making our negotiations to be
very clear in our communication

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and to take that extra step
to see if we can broker

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.702 align:middle line:84%
the deal, whatever that is, just
because of the vulnerability.

00:27:21.702 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, it doesn't
mean that the cycle

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.320 align:middle line:90%
predicts what will happen.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It says there's a vulnerability.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is all based on what
we see in the past cycles.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago, apparently, we
were in a very similar cycle.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And the geologists now
are confirming this.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a climate change
cycle that was missed.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so recent, they
thought the climate change--

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could they miss it?

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.826 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because they
thought it only happens

00:27:43.826 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:90%
on these huge scales of time.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So the researchers, they took
data from seafloor sediments,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
from Antarctica, from
the ice core sediments.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They went to the Andes and to
Southern Peru, ice sediments.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
They took tree ring data
from northern Europe.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They put all this together
and they said, my god.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.079 align:middle line:90%
5,000 ago?

00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It says-- and it's very,
very similar to what we have.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
one 5,000 before that.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.219 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't it interesting?

00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the flood of Noah.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
In all these things,
they all seem

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:84%
to correlate with each
other, don't they?

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They do when
we are willing to cross

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:84%
the traditional boundaries
that have separated

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:90%
the sciences in the past.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So my feeling is that we
are now facing these--

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.175 align:middle line:90%
it's not just one big crisis.

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:31.967 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
this convergence of--

00:28:31.967 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we at a
critical juncture here?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.074 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think we are.

00:28:35.074 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:90%
We are resilient as a species.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.802 align:middle line:90%
And we know how to adapt.

00:28:39.802 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But what's different
about today, George,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
we're really good at dealing
with one big problem at a time.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:90%
So, and like, the ice age came.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody was pretty
much focused on the ice age.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:90%
1929, the Great Depression.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.724 align:middle line:90%
We focused on that.

00:28:52.724 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:90%
We knew how to--

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we attacked it.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: World War
I, World War II--

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.923 align:middle line:84%
we knew how to deal
with those things.

00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:84%
What's happening, we've never
as a civilization, as a global,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
connected civilization, been
faced with so many unique

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
crises of such magnitude--
failing economies that now--

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.351 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All at the same time.

00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Climate
change, what's happening

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to social change
that's happening

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East, energy,
what's happening, the way we're

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:84%
doing with energy, disease, the
kinds of diseases we've never

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:90%
seen on a global scale before.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
the invitation for us

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to rethink the story of us and
our relationship to the world.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And the science gives
us a good reason

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:10%
to do that if we're willing
to honor the science, if we're

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:10%
willing to honor the data,
and allow the data to tell us

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:10%
the story rather
than trying to force

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:10%
the data into a
pre-conceived story

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:10%
the we know is no longer true.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gregg, I want
people to track you.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.237 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:29:50.237 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:90%
What's your website?

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Website--
www.greggbraden.com.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:10%
G-R-E-G-G-- that means
it's not a Gregory.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:10%
G-R-E-G-G B-R-A-D-E-N .com.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could go on
forever with you on this.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.092 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, and
I could as well.

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important, George.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
facts are clear,

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:90%
our choices become obvious.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the key-- when
the facts are clear,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to
be told what to do.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.480 align:middle line:90%
The choices become obvious.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.509 align:middle line:84%
And science has now
given us those facts.

00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's continue
talking about this.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.015 align:middle line:90%
Gregg Braden--

00:30:18.015 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Thank you so much.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, those six
questions that Gregg

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
had asked and mentioned
earlier in the program.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever get
the answers to them?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:10%
But if we ever do,
then we'll fully

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:10%
understand why we're here.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:50.026 align:middle line:90%
