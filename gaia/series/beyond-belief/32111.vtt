[Background Music]

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.903 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.303 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:08.442 align:middle line:84%
>> People need to keep on-- help
uncover what really happened.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.811 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.682 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:22.256 align:middle line:84%
>> And now the host of
the nationally syndicated,

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.657 align:middle line:90%
Coast to Coast A.M.  [applause]

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and  Gaiam TV bring you Beyond
Belief with George Noory.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.897 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Thanks again
and welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.733 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there
are forces at work

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:37.204 align:middle line:84%
to control your health,
to control your finances

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:42.342 align:middle line:84%
because they want to make the
money and take advantage of you?

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:46.346 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on Beyond Belief
is a homeopathic doctor,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.282 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Robin Falkov, Robin.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.717 align:middle line:90%
[Applause] Good to see you.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.551 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Thank you.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.486 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.755 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
did you get involved

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%
in homeopathic medicine?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.994 align:middle line:84%
What was it out there that
really sparked your interest?

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Well
it's an interesting story

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.599 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sure that
everybody can relate

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.536 align:middle line:84%
to because had I known what
homeopathy was I would not have

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:84%
really tried what was
recommended to me.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:16.143 align:middle line:84%
But not knowing I used
this particular remedy

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.478 align:middle line:84%
and I was wondering
what felt strange

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:25.018 align:middle line:84%
because there was a vocal cord
infection and some congestion

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.354 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't respond to
antibiotics and my neighbor

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.793 align:middle line:84%
at the time said try this but I
tried it and I didn't get tired.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:34.227 align:middle line:90%
My mouth didn't get dry.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:38.497 align:middle line:84%
My eyes didn't get wet
but my symptoms went away.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:84%
That was proof for me and
then I continued exploring

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.573 align:middle line:84%
and educating myself and was
so much motivated by homeopathy

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.409 align:middle line:84%
that I went back to
school and got my degree

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.111 align:middle line:84%
as a Doctor of Oriental
Medicine.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.212 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good for you.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
Robin is a frequent
guest on Coast to Coast.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.717 align:middle line:84%
So this is a first for us
before a television camera.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And you should not hide yourself
behind a radio mic so often.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And obviously you have
helped a lot of people Robin,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
not only on our program
but in all walks of life,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.734 align:middle line:84%
people that you know,
people that you care about.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.203 align:middle line:84%
What is going on, on this
planet right now to try

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:84%
to control the natural
remedies that are out there,

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.477 align:middle line:84%
that are available to
us, that are inexpensive?

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.846 align:middle line:84%
They want this because
they can't make any money

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:90%
at it, can they?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: No you've
really hit the point there

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.052 align:middle line:90%
with what's going on.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.287 align:middle line:90%
Homeopathy is cheap.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.491 align:middle line:84%
You don't have your
patient's coming back to you

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.926 align:middle line:90%
when you do a proper work up

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.797 align:middle line:84%
and you have identified what
their specific needs are

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:45.465 align:middle line:90%
to get to the root cause.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.568 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the root cause,
you're not treating symptoms,

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.037 align:middle line:90%
you're treating the problem.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:52.606 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you're
able to heal.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.207 align:middle line:84%
But that goes against
the business plan

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:58.045 align:middle line:84%
for western medicine because
when you treat symptoms the

00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:59.346 align:middle line:90%
medications have side effects

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.315 align:middle line:84%
and the side effects
bring the patients back

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.652 align:middle line:84%
for more medication and that
creates unknown entities.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
dangerous pattern

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.527 align:middle line:90%
that has become mainstream now.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.029 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know
I used to look at products

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:21.034 align:middle line:84%
that we would make as a
young boy and I would say,

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.269 align:middle line:84%
"Why do they want to
make a refrigerator

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.106 align:middle line:90%
that would last forever?

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.874 align:middle line:84%
They can't make any
money doing that,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.744 align:middle line:84%
selling one refrigerator
to one family.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.082 align:middle line:84%
They want these things to break
down every five years or so."

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.317 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with
a human being.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.654 align:middle line:84%
Why do we want to cure
you so that you never have

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:84%
to buy pharmaceutical
prescriptions?

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.558 align:middle line:90%
We want you sick.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.393 align:middle line:90%
We want you ill.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.627 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:51.431 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to solve
the human dilemma, do they?

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: No they
don't and oh gosh, George.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.204 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'll get into
some of this later.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.673 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing so much research

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.542 align:middle line:84%
which everything
is the right time

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.411 align:middle line:90%
because had I encountered some

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of this information before
I would have brushed it off

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and said they're conspiracy
nuts and that's how some

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.187 align:middle line:84%
of this information was
reviewed and denied to take away

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:18.658 align:middle line:84%
from what it really is and
it's a great business plan.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.594 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine a better plan?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.662 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It's genius.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes, yeah.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
But just let's not use it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.201 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I mean most people

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
if you're a good business
man and you've developed

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.606 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking for a
pharmaceutical company the name

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.208 align:middle line:84%
of the game is to come
up with new market share.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.711 align:middle line:90%
You come up with new drugs.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:84%
They race them through
the FDA for approval.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.783 align:middle line:84%
The FDA in a year or two
later yanks some of them

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.187 align:middle line:84%
because they cause all these
horrible things to people.

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:51.892 align:middle line:84%
It's an unbelievable game
that they're all involved in.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:52.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Definitely,

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:55.095 align:middle line:84%
and we look at the
other components

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
of the game we're dealing with,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.399 align:middle line:84%
people that are very high
up in the government.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.636 align:middle line:84%
They are elected
officials, then they're CEOs

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.338 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceutical companies,
then they work the for the FDA

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:10.544 align:middle line:84%
and they rotate through these
positions with a lot of baggage,

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:14.514 align:middle line:84%
a lot of baggage and a lot
of favors that are owed.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.417 align:middle line:84%
So we don't get what we
really need to be getting

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.086 align:middle line:84%
out of the companies that
are there to protect us.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.756 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Lawyers who
work for the FDA end up working

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:84%
for the companies that they
would approve or vice versa.

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The company's lawyers would
retire then they become top

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.499 align:middle line:90%
government officials in the FDA.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.468 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's an unbelievable
game.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:38.171 align:middle line:84%
I like and you do too,
mainstream medicine.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.107 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of good doctors
out there who are truly trying

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle line:84%
to make us better but
not a lot of them.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to
all understand

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.048 align:middle line:90%
that there are other ways

00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:51.384 align:middle line:84%
and alternative ways
to fix ourselves.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.021 align:middle line:84%
You do. You go through a regimen
of things to help people,

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.225 align:middle line:84%
people again that you've cared
about, no names mentioned,

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:03.096 align:middle line:84%
but you have been able to make a
lot of people healthy naturally.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Definitely.

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.632 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What does that
tell you about the human body

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:08.602 align:middle line:90%
and its ability to fight back?

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:11.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
It's powerful.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.273 align:middle line:90%
There are no limits.

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:16.443 align:middle line:84%
There really are no limits
and what I take issue

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
with are the physicians that
many of them are so well-meaning

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.384 align:middle line:84%
but they will still
tell a patient,

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.354 align:middle line:84%
"There's absolutely
nothing that you can do.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.255 align:middle line:90%
This has no cure.

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:29.456 align:middle line:90%
We can't had help you.

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.057 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing."

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It should be there's
nothing in western medicine

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
because there are many
other modalities not just

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.599 align:middle line:84%
homeopathies, not
just Chinese medicine,

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.735 align:middle line:90%
not just herbs or supplements.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
There's an enormous
amount to choose

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:90%
from that is highly effective.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.377 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How much of
our illness is directly related

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:55.915 align:middle line:84%
to what mankind has done in the
environment wherever you go?

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:56.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Gosh George,

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:02.522 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that's
the root cause

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.858 align:middle line:84%
because you have
the environment.

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:08.228 align:middle line:84%
You have all the chemical
pollution, nuclear pollution,

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:13.733 align:middle line:84%
oil, fracking, contaminants
from pesticides, from GMOs.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:18.371 align:middle line:84%
You have these enormous
loads on the immune system

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.673 align:middle line:90%
and there's just so much

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:24.077 align:middle line:84%
that a body can take before
that's the final straw

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and something happens that
you start to have symptoms

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.115 align:middle line:90%
and you start to break down.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:33.987 align:middle line:84%
Our food is grown is the soil
that does not have the minerals

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that are necessary
to sustain health.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle line:84%
The amount of time that
it takes for your food

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.227 align:middle line:84%
to reach the supermarket
can be weeks.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:45.832 align:middle line:84%
In that period of time the
nutritional quality breaks down.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:50.103 align:middle line:84%
So we're fighting a
battle that can be resolved

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:51.838 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to
just be saying bad things.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:54.474 align:middle line:84%
There are solutions
and that gets back

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.409 align:middle line:90%
to those little victory farms

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.946 align:middle line:84%
and people having
community gardens and sharing

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.015 align:middle line:84%
and really getting to
know their neighbors.

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:05.685 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: There's
nothing like a homegrown tomato.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
You go to a store and get one
it's like eating cardboard

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.194 align:middle line:84%
but you grab one out of your
own garden it's different.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
You know I always used to look
at how farmers would spray

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals to kill weeds in
the middle of their corn crop

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.638 align:middle line:84%
or their soybean crop and I'm
going they're spraying these

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:31.044 align:middle line:84%
weeds and they're spraying the
ground to kill these weeds.

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.413 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that stuff
grow up into the plant?

00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:35.949 align:middle line:90%
And then what does it do to us?

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Definitely.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.755 align:middle line:84%
I remember, gosh this
is in the late '80s

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:44.257 align:middle line:84%
or '90s there was
a big announcement

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
about the use of
Alar for apples.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.031 align:middle line:84%
All the apples throughout the
United States, spraying them

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.802 align:middle line:84%
but it was a systemic chemical
that the apple took up so

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:59.572 align:middle line:84%
that it would withstand
bruising when traveling

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.642 align:middle line:84%
so we could have our perfect
fruits because of the chemicals.

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather have the bruising
and not have the chemicals.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.315 align:middle line:84%
So I watched, sometimes
I'm lucky and I see

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
when a story breaks and I follow
it because we get one story

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:90%
that changes and changes

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.791 align:middle line:84%
and becomes spun
into something else.

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:20.493 align:middle line:90%
This was the reverse.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.596 align:middle line:84%
This was an honest
reporting that happened

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and that was back then
where they finally said

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.835 align:middle line:84%
after all the reports
that it was safe.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Grocery stores were stuffing
your shopping bags with flyers.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.808 align:middle line:90%
All your apples are safe.

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about this and then
they came out and said yes,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.979 align:middle line:84%
they are problems and
we can't be using this.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.781 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Of course,
there's always problems

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:45.151 align:middle line:84%
that they come out and tell us
later after we bend their arms

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.087 align:middle line:90%
or talk about it on the media.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:51.324 align:middle line:84%
As you all know I am a proponent
of supplements and vitamins

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:55.195 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, yet that area is
under fire too in several ways.

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:57.831 align:middle line:90%
One, I'm confused.

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be very
honest with you.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:01.734 align:middle line:90%
I'm told take fish oil.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.735 align:middle line:90%
It's good for your heart.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It's good for your arteries

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.173 align:middle line:84%
and now I've seen two
independent studies.

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.942 align:middle line:84%
I still need to find
out where they're coming

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.412 align:middle line:84%
from that says fish oil
is not good for the heart,

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:16.449 align:middle line:84%
could clog up your arteries and
it also causes prostate cancer.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Now what the heck is a person
who's reading information,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.224 align:middle line:84%
trying to digest so much stuff
so we can do what we need to do

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:27.861 align:middle line:84%
for our own health,
what do we do?

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.896 align:middle line:84%
I mean you get these
conflicting stories.

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:84%
I know our friend
Christian Wilde is trying

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.766 align:middle line:90%
to investigate this.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:34.901 align:middle line:90%
He's baffled.

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean now he's scared.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.837 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
I have the book.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.974 align:middle line:84%
They sent me the book
to review the book.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.843 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read through this.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:84%
I know some of the warnings
that I've been aware

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.548 align:middle line:90%
of for years with fish oils.

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
have sensitivities

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.253 align:middle line:84%
to certain fish oils
and they can present

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with arthritic type symptoms,
swollen joints, achy joints,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:84%
pains but the big
caveat with fish oils are

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.233 align:middle line:90%
where are the fish coming from?

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.302 align:middle line:90%
What's the size of the fish?

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:12.171 align:middle line:84%
So you have krill oil
which is very popular.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:17.844 align:middle line:84%
And krill are little tiny fish,
itty-bitty ones that whales eat

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:21.481 align:middle line:84%
so they use krill oil and
that is supposed to be good.

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.951 align:middle line:84%
It's got your essential
fatty acids, the DCA,

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
all of these other
things for the brain

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.124 align:middle line:84%
that help your body
function to optimal levels.

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:39.165 align:middle line:84%
I don't get the bad thing,
the bad quality products yes

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle line:84%
and that could be
where the research is.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But with what you brought
up George, there are a lot

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of studies that get published
every time they're ramping

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.375 align:middle line:90%
up attacks against supplements

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:53.112 align:middle line:84%
where they will make a blanket
statement Vitamin E has been

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.982 align:middle line:84%
shown to be harmful or
it causes more cancer.

00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.617 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Or D
is not good for you.

00:11:57.617 --> 00:11:59.285 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was good for you.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: But
with Vitamin E you want

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:04.824 align:middle line:84%
to take a Vitamin E that
has mixed tocopherols.

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:08.194 align:middle line:84%
Those are all the naturally
occurring components

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:12.031 align:middle line:84%
of Vitamin E and when you
have that it's balanced.

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:13.366 align:middle line:90%
The body utilizes it.

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not causing a problem
because something's missing.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So they don't give you the
source and they don't tell you

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.377 align:middle line:84%
if it's synthetic or
natural which is a big deal

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:27.714 align:middle line:90%
because our bodies are not going

00:12:27.714 --> 00:12:31.751 align:middle line:84%
to find the synthetics
biologically available, so.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.752 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You've
been doing a lot of work

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.354 align:middle line:90%
with light emitting diodes.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.688 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at what this is.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh, okay.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Now Dr. Falkov,
tell me about your work

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.829 align:middle line:84%
with live emitting
diode technology.

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Oh, thank you.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.167 align:middle line:90%
One of my big areas of interest

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:51.904 align:middle line:84%
for the past six years has been
light emitting diode technology

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.842 align:middle line:84%
and I have a very, very
dear friend and colleague,

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.277 align:middle line:84%
Harry Whelan who
is a neurologist.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:90%
He's in the NASA Hall of Fame.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing my
research the one name I came

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.454 align:middle line:84%
across Dr. Harry
Whelan, Dr. Harry Whelan

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:13.993 align:middle line:84%
and the big impressive data that
he showed through peer review,

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.296 align:middle line:84%
double-blind studies
was that the application

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:21.401 align:middle line:84%
of light emitting diodes using
infrared and far-infrared

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:25.438 align:middle line:84%
in the 630 to 680
nanometer wavelength

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:29.642 align:middle line:84%
which stimulates cellular
mitochondrial production

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:34.147 align:middle line:84%
of adenosine triphosphate
and that's the fuel

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:84%
that powers your muscles, your
nerves, your brain function.

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.086 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
does that work Robin?

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.989 align:middle line:84%
How do these light emitting
diodes actually heal people?

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh gosh.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:45.725 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
what do they look like?

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
It's wonderful.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
We're plugged in for one of the
units and this is the technology

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.868 align:middle line:84%
that I found for
my dog, for my dog.

00:13:55.868 --> 00:14:00.707 align:middle line:84%
She had contaminated food that
increased her liver enzymes

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to five times the range
and I did my investigation

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
because she was eight years
old, a bullmastiff, large breed.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.349 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is quick
to tell you oh,

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:13.286 align:middle line:84%
you know they only live
seven or eight years.

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.687 align:middle line:90%
She lived three more years.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:18.391 align:middle line:84%
Everything stabilized and I did
apply a slightly different type

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:26.799 align:middle line:84%
machine over her liver and this
is the color of a red light

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.969 align:middle line:84%
and the effective wavelength
as I had said is a 630

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.271 align:middle line:90%
to 680 nanometer wavelength.

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:36.008 align:middle line:84%
Now Harry Whelan, who I
mentioned, he's in the NASA Hall

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:39.345 align:middle line:84%
of Fame for the research
that he's done for NASA,

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:42.615 align:middle line:84%
for our astronauts
on this technology

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:48.921 align:middle line:84%
and he has his studies that,
peer reviewed studies, that--

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.157 align:middle line:90%
yeah, this unit gets hot,

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:54.227 align:middle line:84%
so there's a fan behind
here to cool it off.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.796 align:middle line:84%
And it cycles for
only for four minutes

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.097 align:middle line:90%
so you use three applications.

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.465 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So you put
it directly on the skin?

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: You
put it right on the skin

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:02.668 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have worry
about contamination

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.537 align:middle line:84%
because it's recessed
where the lights are.

00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:05.638 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you move
it or just keep it there?

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
You keep it in one place

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.743 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it there for four
minutes and if you're treating

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:15.214 align:middle line:84%
that one area you would do it
12 minutes total then you could

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.549 align:middle line:90%
move it up to a shoulder.

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:17.817 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Sore backs, anything?

00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:20.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes,
sore backs, dental stuff.

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:22.955 align:middle line:84%
I've just had so much
dental work done.

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:90%
This stuff, oh my gosh.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.858 align:middle line:90%
My dentist was wowed.

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.761 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I can't believe
how well you healed."

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.164 align:middle line:90%
So it's great like that.

00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Is it
also like a pain reliever?

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
It does, yes.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.336 align:middle line:84%
The FDA allows us to
state that this is

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:41.974 align:middle line:84%
for temporary relief pain
and increased circulation

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.777 align:middle line:84%
but going back to the peer
reviewed research data

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:49.949 align:middle line:84%
that Harry Whelan did it
showed that that wavelength

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.751 align:middle line:84%
of light can increase
the production

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:56.489 align:middle line:84%
of adenosine triphosphate which
is the fuel inside your cells

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:59.592 align:middle line:84%
that makes your muscles contract
and let's your brain think

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
wonderful things

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.062 align:middle line:90%
that we need to do to be alive.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It increases that from
200 to 400 percent

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.502 align:middle line:90%
and that blows me away.

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:15.808 align:middle line:84%
And I have had reports from
patients and from customers

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.211 align:middle line:90%
that are just astonished.

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:23.816 align:middle line:84%
There was one conference that
I was at and I had always asked

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.252 align:middle line:84%
if someone in the audience
has pain at the moment

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:30.122 align:middle line:84%
and they can use the machine
and then we'll see afterwards

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:33.025 align:middle line:84%
and at the end when I
finished speaking he said,

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.527 align:middle line:90%
"Well Doc, no, no.

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:35.428 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:36.762 align:middle line:90%
I can't really say."

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And then two hours later
he's running to tell me.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.437 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.839 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: My father
a long, long time ago,

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:49.876 align:middle line:84%
my late father used to
use an infrared light,

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:53.546 align:middle line:84%
a red infrared light and he
used to hold it on himself

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.248 align:middle line:90%
for a while and I'm wondering

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:57.783 align:middle line:84%
if that might have been
the same principle?

00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:59.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: It's
the principle with the red

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:02.855 align:middle line:84%
and the penetration of
infrared to relax muscles

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.791 align:middle line:84%
and increase circulation
so it's quite similar.

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:09.662 align:middle line:84%
This has been fine tuned
to that specific wavelength

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:12.265 align:middle line:84%
for the cellular
interaction with it.

00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:15.368 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And isn't
amazing in Star Trek,

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.804 align:middle line:84%
good old doc would
use a light like that

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.573 align:middle line:90%
or something like that to heal.

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:23.442 align:middle line:84%
I remember in "Close Encounters
of a Third Kind" or "ET",

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:26.379 align:middle line:84%
The Extraterrestrial,
the Spielberg movie,

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.347 align:middle line:84%
didn't he have a little light
at the end of his finger

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and he healed people like that?

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yeah.

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:33.085 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So
there's a technology there.

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.922 align:middle line:84%
Does this technology get
better in the future?

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.324 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything more
they can do with it?

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:39.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes.

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:42.495 align:middle line:84%
There are enormous
possibilities and you have--

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:47.033 align:middle line:84%
there was a study that
Harry Whelan got approved

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:49.535 align:middle line:84%
for the National
Institute of Health

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:84%
where he was combining an
engineered blood protein

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.007 align:middle line:84%
that would be attracted
to light.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So they engineered it
to be photo-sensitive

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:03.282 align:middle line:84%
so they can implant these
little LEDs in the brain

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:08.921 align:middle line:84%
and then they inject the drug
and it gets drawn to that area

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually a
website anyone can go and look

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.758 align:middle line:84%
at Photofriend [assumed
spelling]

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.361 align:middle line:84%
where they're using
this to treat cancer

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.464 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing you
have to be careful of is

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:22.602 align:middle line:84%
that light sensitization can
be, this would be killer,

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%
but regular room light.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a period of
about six weeks that you'll want

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.044 align:middle line:84%
to wait and be covered and
be very careful with block

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.647 align:middle line:84%
to protect yourself
but great results.

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:37.216 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take some
questions for Dr. Robin Falkov.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right over here.

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:39.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Robin.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.787 align:middle line:84%
My name is Catherine
and I struggle

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:46.926 align:middle line:84%
from some serious health issues
and I am pretty much given

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:48.761 align:middle line:90%
up on modern medicine.

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:51.464 align:middle line:84%
To heal myself I
have my own garden.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.898 align:middle line:90%
I'm a vegetarian.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.968 align:middle line:84%
I want to know where
I can get one

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
of these machines
that you have there.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:03.909 align:middle line:84%
Are they available to
be purchased through you

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.078 align:middle line:90%
or how would I obtain one?

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.147 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yeah, can
you get these or do you have

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.882 align:middle line:84%
to get a prescription
to buy it or what?

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: No, you
don't need a prescription

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:14.487 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for the
question Catherine

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:18.057 align:middle line:84%
and it's good what you're
doing with your own garden.

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:20.126 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I sell these units.

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:22.361 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: On your website
healthfreedom rights.com.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: And
you're welcome to speak

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
with me afterwards or however
you'd like to contact me.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
long does it take?

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:31.504 align:middle line:84%
Like you were talking about
the guy with the back problem

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.274 align:middle line:84%
at the convention, a couple of
hours later he's jumping around.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
That was unusual.

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.443 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Generally
how long does it take?

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle line:90%
How long do you apply it?

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you do it every
day and for how long?

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Okay.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:46.018 align:middle line:84%
With this unit you would
apply it for 12 minutes

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:49.055 align:middle line:84%
to one particular
area and then move it.

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:84%
What happens is your cells
get saturated with light.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.261 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of
biophotonic energy,

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.831 align:middle line:84%
a similar kind what you get
when you're picking that tomato

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.334 align:middle line:84%
from your garden and it's just
bursting with all the vibrance

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:06.272 align:middle line:84%
from the sun and there are
actual measurements that show

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:10.476 align:middle line:84%
that level of energy that
the cells hold on to.

00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:13.846 align:middle line:84%
So you'd wait probably
around four

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:16.816 align:middle line:84%
to six hours before
repeating the treatment again

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:18.484 align:middle line:84%
so that you know it
will be utilized.

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
But it won't hurt you.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.356 align:middle line:90%
It's very effective and please,

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:27.793 align:middle line:84%
keep in mind there are
many reports from patients

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:30.362 align:middle line:84%
and from friends
and treating animals

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of wonderful therapeutic effects

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
but technically the FDA
allows the statement that it's

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.441 align:middle line:84%
for temporary relief of pain
and increased circulation.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.242 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.081 align:middle line:84%
How valuable is the Internet
these days Robin to people

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.184 align:middle line:84%
who want to self-diagnosis
and try to take care

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
of themselves naturally?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Well, with a little bit

00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:00.926 align:middle line:84%
of guidance it's priceless and
what I find very frustrating

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.995 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people that
I've come in contact

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:06.532 align:middle line:84%
with they consider
having a procedure

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:09.935 align:middle line:84%
to get more information,
something diagnostic

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor tells
them, "Don't worry.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.608 align:middle line:90%
There's no issue with this.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.777 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
be concerned about."

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.378 align:middle line:90%
And you can do Google search

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:22.047 align:middle line:84%
and the way the search
engines are operated it's

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.683 align:middle line:84%
from the frequency of
the sites that you go to,

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:27.853 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are on
top, it doesn't mean

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
that that's the right
information

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:33.826 align:middle line:84%
so in this particular
instance you have to,

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:38.597 align:middle line:84%
it was for a procedure that was
an angioplasty, you have to go

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
down the page and see and
then maybe seven or eight

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:48.374 align:middle line:84%
down you find out there could be
fluid around the heart, stroke,

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:52.344 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, heart attack,
all kinds of problems

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:57.449 align:middle line:84%
that can happen so you'll
want to proceed carefully.

00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:00.886 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a big
challenge that I find

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle line:84%
because most doctors will
just do what I said initially,

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:06.458 align:middle line:90%
"Don't worry.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.359 align:middle line:90%
You go home with a band aid.

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.994 align:middle line:90%
It's no big deal."

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
How many patients are
going to push and ask,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.566 align:middle line:90%
what are the complications?

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:16.168 align:middle line:84%
What's the percentage
of complications?

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:22.541 align:middle line:84%
Because me, you, all of us
we fall into that percentage

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:23.876 align:middle line:90%
at one time or another.

00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:27.379 align:middle line:84%
You never know when you're
immune system will be different

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:31.784 align:middle line:84%
than expected and you can have a
reaction that they don't expect

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:36.288 align:middle line:84%
so you really have a lot of
due diligence that's necessary

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.658 align:middle line:84%
and I feel for everyone
because I find the same thing

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:84%
for myself, the same
conundrum like the fish oil.

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.531 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you
recommend that everybody

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
at least take a multiple
vitamin every day?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Multiple vitamins are great.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:53.405 align:middle line:84%
You've got to determine if
they have iron in them or not.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
There are some viral conditions.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.574 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Some people
can't take iron, right?

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yeah.

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:57.509 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Hemochromatosis.

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Hemochromatosis,

00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:01.847 align:middle line:84%
viral infections
they thrive on iron.

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:06.085 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
different things to check

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:08.153 align:middle line:84%
and you know what a
pain I am about that.

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:09.288 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
you're the one that got me

00:23:09.288 --> 00:23:11.957 align:middle line:84%
on to Co-Q 10, saying
that you've got to have

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:14.827 align:middle line:84%
that for your heart and
especially if you're trying

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:16.528 align:middle line:90%
to reduce your cholesterol.

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:19.131 align:middle line:84%
It depletes that in your
body and it's critical

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.466 align:middle line:90%
to have that in there.

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:25.304 align:middle line:84%
So I take 200 milligrams a
day, even took one last night.

00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:29.541 align:middle line:84%
What has been the
most satisfying thing

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
for you in this field?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh, gosh.

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:37.616 align:middle line:90%
When I get the feedback.

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.619 align:middle line:84%
You'd be surprised a lot of
times people don't get back

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:43.022 align:middle line:84%
to you and say, "That
was wonderful.

00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:44.723 align:middle line:90%
I feel incredible."

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:45.924 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You need that.

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.092 align:middle line:90%
You need to learn.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes, yes.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.363 align:middle line:84%
So recently I broke
one of my rules

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and someone was having a problem
and I had worked with them

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.974 align:middle line:84%
and helped them out and just
simple product for fibromyalgia

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:05.978 align:middle line:84%
and then for sleep
problems and it was

00:24:05.978 --> 00:24:09.315 align:middle line:84%
like this woman's life
was back on track.

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:10.549 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What I've noticed

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:12.918 align:middle line:84%
when you mentioned
sleep problems,

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
you go to a drugstore they're
all selling now natural sleep

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:90%
remedies, nonprescription

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
that you can find right there
over-the-counter these days.

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, whether it's
melatonin or something else,

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.136 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pharmaceutical
companies,

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:34.807 align:middle line:84%
drugstores are beginning to go
natural with a lot of stuff.

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.508 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have
their pharmacies

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're making a
lot of money doing that

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.714 align:middle line:84%
but I've noticed a lot of
natural things on the counters.

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
There's a demand.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.354 align:middle line:84%
They're taking advantage of the
demand and the interesting thing

00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:50.923 align:middle line:84%
with melatonin that
I found personally

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:52.524 align:middle line:84%
and then have reproduced
with a lot

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:57.997 align:middle line:84%
of my patients is a low
does is more effective

00:24:57.997 --> 00:24:59.131 align:middle line:90%
for knocking you out.

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You're right.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
I was astonished

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.936 align:middle line:90%
that that is how it works.

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:06.038 align:middle line:84%
You can get therapeutic
effects with melatonin

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:09.174 align:middle line:84%
for other conditions in
building the immune system

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.442 align:middle line:90%
but the low dose works.

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:13.812 align:middle line:84%
The only warning with
melatonin is that if you're

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:17.416 align:middle line:84%
under 30 years old you
don't want to take it

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:20.352 align:middle line:84%
because you want your body
to produce it naturally.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.788 align:middle line:84%
And to do that it's very
important that you sleep

00:25:22.788 --> 00:25:24.456 align:middle line:84%
in a dark room and
you're exposure

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:26.992 align:middle line:84%
to bright lights at
night is limited.

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:29.928 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Does your body
generally reduce the production

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of melatonin as you get older?

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: It depends
upon, you know people sleep

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
with a light on or the
bathroom door light is on

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.841 align:middle line:84%
and that effects your
production of melatonin

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:47.279 align:middle line:84%
and it can taper off but
you can build yourself back

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to having the ideal amounts just
with your environment changes.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Higher doses
you get wild dreams with them.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.456 align:middle line:90%
It's strange

00:25:57.456 --> 00:25:58.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Sometimes yeah.

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:04.096 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I tested myself
on melatonin about ten years ago

00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:07.266 align:middle line:84%
and I think 50 milligrams is
probably the good level now.

00:26:07.266 --> 00:26:09.201 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you'd
call low dose?

00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:12.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh, no, no
like one milligram is low dose.

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Really?

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:14.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh, God.

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.241 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: No wonder
I'm having these wild dreams

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:19.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
I think I'll have

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:22.514 align:middle line:84%
to try the 50 milligrams
and have some wild dreams.

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.916 align:middle line:90%
>> It is amazing.

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.584 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: There aren't
a lot of people that freeze up

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.419 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
what to ask the doctor

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.088 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor probably
isn't a great communicator.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:35.427 align:middle line:84%
And he or she doesn't know
what to say to the patient.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:38.096 align:middle line:90%
How many people are like that?

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Probably the majority

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.499 align:middle line:90%
because what you're dealing

00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:43.902 align:middle line:84%
with is something that's
actually measurable.

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:46.171 align:middle line:90%
It's called white-coat syndrome.

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:84%
When the patient is
at the doctor's office

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're checking the vitals,
including the blood pressure.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.714 align:middle line:84%
>> I was that way since
I was a young boy.

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.915 align:middle line:90%
Whenever I'd going

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:59.017 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor's office my
blood pressure would be

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.419 align:middle line:90%
out of control.

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:03.322 align:middle line:84%
They actually thought oh my God
something's wrong with this kid

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:07.726 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as I calmed down
or realized I was leaving

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:11.697 align:middle line:84%
or he wasn't going to give me
a shot it came all the way back

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:12.798 align:middle line:90%
down again.

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly what
you're talking about

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Yes, definitely.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.104 align:middle line:84%
And you have an attitude
which is unfortunate

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.573 align:middle line:84%
because there are
a lot of physicians

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that have the right intentions
when they go into healing

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.048 align:middle line:84%
and something changes with the
pressures that are put them

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:33.719 align:middle line:84%
by different medical
organizations and the lack

00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:36.822 align:middle line:84%
of time and the, oh my gosh,
the nightmare of changes

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:40.592 align:middle line:84%
that we have now with insurance
where you're having doctors

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that are dictated to about what
they can do, so they're shorter

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.200 align:middle line:84%
with the patient but a lot of
them have this problem with,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.271 align:middle line:84%
I don't know it's
not, pontificating

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:56.608 align:middle line:84%
with being crystal ball readers
where they'll tell someone,

00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:00.379 align:middle line:84%
"Well, you're going to
die in three months."

00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.981 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see that.

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.149 align:middle line:90%
You can't judge that.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:07.352 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing
is programming somebody

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
on multiple levels to live
up to that expectation

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.794 align:middle line:84%
and as we have discussed
in the past there's

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.996 align:middle line:90%
so much that can be done.

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:23.869 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole function of
being an advocate to reassure

00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:26.772 align:middle line:84%
and be that presence either
being there physically there

00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:31.043 align:middle line:84%
with them through Skype,
there's so many different ways

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:34.279 align:middle line:84%
so that the patient gets
heard and they're not told,

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:38.417 align:middle line:84%
"That's okay dear, we
know what's best for you."

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:39.451 align:middle line:90%
which happens.

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.552 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It happens a lot.

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.321 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy who
went to see his doctor.

00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:45.757 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't feeling well and the
doctor gave him a blood test

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.359 align:middle line:90%
and he came back and said

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.861 align:middle line:84%
"I've got some really
bad news for you."

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:50.963 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "What do you mean?"

00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:53.999 align:middle line:90%
He says, "You've got ten."

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:56.969 align:middle line:90%
And the guy says, "Ten?

00:28:56.969 --> 00:28:58.537 align:middle line:90%
Ten what? Ten years?

00:28:58.537 --> 00:28:59.204 align:middle line:90%
Ten months?

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.372 align:middle line:90%
What doc? What?"

00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:03.342 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor went,
"Nine, eight, seven, six--

00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:07.613 align:middle line:84%
" The doctor wasn't
a good communicator.

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:10.449 align:middle line:90%
What is a patient's advocate?

00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: It's the
person who will be there when,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.391 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can accompany someone
to these doctors' visits.

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.994 align:middle line:90%
I can be there in the hospital.

00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:24.796 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
to go about it.

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.466 align:middle line:84%
I can work with the
family closely.

00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:32.604 align:middle line:84%
The big deal is to be available
and I can make myself available

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:36.642 align:middle line:84%
to answer those questions and
then be present through Skype

00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not in the same location
because we have a situation

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:90%
that was just reported on.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:90%
About five days ago with a woman

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.156 align:middle line:84%
who had what they assumed
was a drug overdose

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.924 align:middle line:84%
and they thought
that she was dead.

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:57.496 align:middle line:84%
And she had mixed different
pharmaceutical drugs

00:29:57.496 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and she was out.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.564 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: They were ready

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.833 align:middle line:84%
to take her organs
out and donate them.

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:04.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes
and she opened her eyes.

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:06.071 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: On
the operating table

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:09.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: And they
were ready to harvest so I mean,

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:13.045 align:middle line:84%
you cannot leave anybody
alone in the hospital

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:14.913 align:middle line:90%
and even that goes to pets.

00:30:14.913 --> 00:30:18.517 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how far
people want to take it.

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Here's another case.

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:22.888 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks ago a
family just got convicted

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:90%
of their child who died.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:30.429 align:middle line:84%
It was a diabetic baby and they
elected no medical treatment

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:32.364 align:middle line:90%
at all, simply prayer.

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:36.768 align:middle line:84%
I'm the type of person to
say, look you need it all.

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.236 align:middle line:90%
You need natural.

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:40.439 align:middle line:84%
You need modern and
you need prayer.

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:43.775 align:middle line:84%
Put it all together but
they elected simply prayer.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:47.512 align:middle line:84%
As a patient's advocate I assume
you would have advised them a

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:50.348 align:middle line:84%
little bit more than
just prayer.

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Religious beliefs are something

00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:54.352 align:middle line:90%
that are very challenging.

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:58.123 align:middle line:84%
I can advise, and the
other doctors can advise.

00:30:58.123 --> 00:31:03.662 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's the patient's
right to choose for themselves

00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
has been taken away.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.633 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But the courts
have said it's not your right.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:13.505 align:middle line:84%
You killed your child by telling
them no medical treatment.

00:31:13.505 --> 00:31:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So who's right in a
situation like that,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.442 align:middle line:90%
the state or the parent?

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:19.778 align:middle line:84%
The parent who says, look
it's my responsibility,

00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:23.048 align:middle line:84%
it's my child, I'm going
to tell them what they want

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:26.485 align:middle line:84%
but the state steps in and says
you did not give this child

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:90%
proper medical treatment.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.357 align:middle line:84%
There's a definition there
what's proper medical treatment.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:35.727 align:middle line:84%
But they have convicted these
people for this, homicide.

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:36.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Oh, my gosh.

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:43.235 align:middle line:84%
That's tragic because
as much as I would

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:47.139 align:middle line:84%
like to see the other
treatments you have got to--

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:90%
it's a very, very fine line.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.075 align:middle line:90%
It's a very difficult case.

00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You have got to respect
the parent's right

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
because when you don't
and the state steps

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:84%
in as they have done they've
taken children and forced them

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:00.852 align:middle line:84%
to have chemotherapy
and they've killed them.

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:02.254 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I agree.

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It is a horrible position for
a parent to be in, either way.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:90%
It's almost as if you can't win.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:10.195 align:middle line:84%
Because at what point
did the state

00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:14.299 align:middle line:84%
through schools literally force
people to take injections.

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take this shot.

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:18.136 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take that
shot and you really have

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.273 align:middle line:84%
to be a conscientious
objector in order

00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:90%
to get your kid not vaccinated.

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yeah and
there are ways to do that,

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:84%
to not have your
children be vaccinated

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and there are wonderful,
wonderful organizations

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.719 align:middle line:84%
that will help and
provide the information

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.088 align:middle line:90%
and I share those links.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:40.392 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned something very
interesting with the schools.

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:42.828 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of parents
don't understand is

00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:46.932 align:middle line:84%
that schools receive additional
government funding for children

00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:49.601 align:middle line:90%
that are deemed special needs.

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:54.172 align:middle line:84%
So we have an explosion
of a diagnosis ADD and lo

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:58.176 align:middle line:84%
and behold we've got a
medication to treat it.

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:02.714 align:middle line:84%
Now if parents want to protect
their children they have

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
when you're child goes

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.155 align:middle line:84%
into school do not sign
forms that permit testing,

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:14.125 align:middle line:84%
psychological testing or other
testing because if they find

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:20.498 align:middle line:84%
that your child has a clinical
diagnosis they will force

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:90%
medicate your child.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:23.134 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Unbelievable.

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:26.071 align:middle line:90%
Just take the kid off sugar.

00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:27.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Thank you, George.

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:28.707 align:middle line:90%
Read my mind.

00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:33.645 align:middle line:84%
Clean up the diet, ripe
food from the garden.

00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Don't
give him a candy bar.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.748 align:middle line:90%
Give him something else.

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:37.883 align:middle line:90%
It is amazing.

00:33:37.883 --> 00:33:40.452 align:middle line:84%
As a patient's advocate,
will the doctor let you

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:42.454 align:middle line:90%
into that room with patient?

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:44.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Oh yes, they will.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.090 align:middle line:90%
They will.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.291 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Do they like you?

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:47.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:50.328 align:middle line:84%
I've had issues in the
past where I would have

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:56.067 align:middle line:84%
to prescreen doctors for my
patients and I would call

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.836 align:middle line:84%
and speak to the
doctors and some

00:33:57.836 --> 00:34:00.972 align:middle line:84%
of them did not want
to work with me.

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:02.973 align:middle line:84%
They just said, "No, you
can't work like that."

00:34:02.973 --> 00:34:04.709 align:middle line:90%
And I respect that.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:08.312 align:middle line:84%
That's their opinion and my
patients want me involved

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:11.049 align:middle line:84%
so they don't work
with those doctors.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.152 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Is it
uncomfortable sometimes

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:16.754 align:middle line:84%
for the patient, for
you to be in front

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:19.424 align:middle line:90%
of a doctor who's squirming?

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:21.059 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they don't
want to talk to you.

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:23.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: I've
had my own personal run-ins

00:34:23.727 --> 00:34:26.031 align:middle line:84%
with doctors that were
squirming and trying

00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:31.903 align:middle line:84%
to push recommendations and all
I kept thinking is don't let me

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:34.272 align:middle line:84%
find out you ever do this
to one of my patients.

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And I assume
a patient who would bring you

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.379 align:middle line:84%
into a doctor's office probably
doesn't know the questions

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:46.618 align:middle line:84%
to ask or is afraid and
they need somebody there

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:49.421 align:middle line:84%
to not only guide them
but to hold their hand

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:52.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Definitely
and it is such an important part

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:57.228 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be amazed how
quickly that fear goes away

00:34:57.228 --> 00:35:03.001 align:middle line:84%
after the first visit and
wow, I'm not wallpaper.

00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:06.805 align:middle line:84%
I'm not somebody for them
to just, okay, next person.

00:35:06.805 --> 00:35:08.173 align:middle line:90%
I'm heard.

00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It just makes the experience
something altogether different.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.778 align:middle line:90%
And that's as it should be.

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:15.313 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Let's do a role play.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.715 align:middle line:90%
You're the patient's advocate.

00:35:16.715 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You're Dr. Robin Falkov and I'm
Dr. George Noory, the oncologist

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.425 align:middle line:84%
and you're representing
Aunt Thelma, who has cancer.

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:31.162 align:middle line:84%
And she has come to you
and she says they want me

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:37.369 align:middle line:84%
to start radiation and chemo and
we don't know anything about it.

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you help us?

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.839 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:44.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Okay well,
first of all for my license

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:84%
and in the United States
you have to be an oncologist

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:50.482 align:middle line:84%
to treat cancer and the only
approved treatments are chemo,

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:52.851 align:middle line:84%
radiation and surgery
all of which are not part

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:54.586 align:middle line:90%
of my scope of practice.

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I work on the immune system
and getting the patient back

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.161 align:middle line:84%
in balance, getting that vibrant
state of health to be achieved

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.664 align:middle line:84%
because it's amazing
what the body's able

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:07.966 align:middle line:90%
to do once you've done that.

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:11.136 align:middle line:84%
So I will do the
research for Aunt Thelma

00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:15.573 align:middle line:84%
and I will show her the
different possible treatments

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.342 align:middle line:90%
from chemo, from radiation.

00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:90%
I will explain--

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.978 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do
you get a blood test

00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:21.746 align:middle line:90%
and look at her chemistry?

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:23.014 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Sure.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.417 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I can order labs and
get the blood tests done.

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:28.219 align:middle line:84%
Now for everyone there's
something very important

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.421 align:middle line:90%
to keep in mind.

00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:84%
There are specific tests
that are done for cancer,

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.595 align:middle line:84%
like the carcinoembryonic
antigen test, the CEA test

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:41.066 align:middle line:84%
and you can have your
numbers that are perfect,

00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:45.070 align:middle line:84%
no evidence whatsoever
and you can have cancer.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.704 align:middle line:90%
So you need a visual check.

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:50.341 align:middle line:84%
I think March was colon cancer
month and there are a lot

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:53.411 align:middle line:84%
of reasons for getting
a colonoscopy to have

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:56.514 align:middle line:84%
that seen just for
that particular reason

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:59.918 align:middle line:84%
that you can be the picture of
health from your blood work.

00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:03.121 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of other
indicators from the blood work.

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:11.262 align:middle line:84%
So you go from that and the
information is kind of slanted

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:15.733 align:middle line:84%
with explanations for
chemo and the side effects

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and the survival rates and
they give you a survival rate

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.338 align:middle line:90%
of five years.

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:24.943 align:middle line:84%
Now chemotherapy is-- they
consider that a success.

00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:26.778 align:middle line:90%
It's a highly toxic drug.

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:29.781 align:middle line:90%
We now have doctors and nurses

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that are administering
this whole family

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.588 align:middle line:84%
of highly toxic drugs
that have cancer just

00:37:36.588 --> 00:37:40.425 align:middle line:84%
from handling the products and
doing IVs for the patients.

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:41.526 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
They got cancer?

00:37:41.526 --> 00:37:43.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
They got cancer as well.

00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:49.501 align:middle line:84%
But the chemo and the radiation
can cause a great proportion

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:90%
of the time secondary cancers.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.105 align:middle line:84%
Some people if they're
that run down

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.175 align:middle line:84%
and depleted it might
show up very soon.

00:37:57.175 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Other people it might show
up five years and one day

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.948 align:middle line:84%
and you're past that
survival rate

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.683 align:middle line:90%
so they consider you a success.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.318 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So if
you come in with Thelma

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:11.055 align:middle line:84%
and you're interviewing me
and were questioning whether

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:14.926 align:middle line:84%
to give her chemo or
radiation and I say we're going

00:38:14.926 --> 00:38:17.128 align:middle line:90%
to administer both to Thelma.

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:20.598 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
her chemo and radiation

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:22.367 align:middle line:90%
over an eight week period.

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:24.068 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:28.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: I ask the
doctor what other alternatives

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.909 align:middle line:84%
do you feel there
are for Thelma?

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:35.113 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: There are no
other alternatives for Thelma.

00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:38.383 align:middle line:84%
We will give her
chemo and radiation.

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:41.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Okay,
and then I ask Thelma,

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:90%
what do you want for yourself?

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:45.523 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And she goes,
"I don't know, I don't know.

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:47.125 align:middle line:90%
You decide Robin?"

00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Well,

00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:49.994 align:middle line:84%
I don't make is the
decisions for my patients.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I will give them information

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
so that they can make
their own informed choices

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.035 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I would do.

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:02.373 align:middle line:84%
There are wonderful lifestyle
changes that a patient can make.

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.474 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot of work.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:06.077 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody wants to do that.

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.545 align:middle line:90%
They want to quick fix.

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:90%
So you might find somebody

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.951 align:middle line:84%
that thinks chemo's
really the answer for me.

00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:15.887 align:middle line:84%
I want to go that
route no matter what

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:18.289 align:middle line:90%
and that's your choice.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:19.858 align:middle line:90%
You have to respect it.

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:23.194 align:middle line:84%
But I will make sure
that everything,

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:26.931 align:middle line:84%
option-wise that I've come up
with is presented to Thelma--

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.333 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: And her family

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:30.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes, and
her family so they understand

00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:35.073 align:middle line:84%
and thank the doctor for his
time and ask him to write

00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:37.675 align:middle line:90%
out specifically what there is,

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:41.045 align:middle line:84%
what assurances he can
make for the treatment.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.514 align:middle line:84%
What kind of side
effects can be expected?

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:47.085 align:middle line:84%
What other options are there
with the drugs that he's chosen.

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:50.722 align:middle line:84%
Is he doing genetic testing
to discover the sensitivity

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.825 align:middle line:84%
of that particular type
of cancer to the drugs

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:55.393 align:middle line:90%
that are being recommended?

00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.428 align:middle line:84%
In other words how
thorough is he?

00:39:57.428 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
If you're going that
route there are ways

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:03.368 align:middle line:90%
to do it and do it thoroughly.

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.337 align:middle line:90%
I'm not here to push my way.

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.306 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to provide
the information

00:40:08.306 --> 00:40:09.607 align:middle line:90%
to make informed choices.

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:11.009 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, you
know I interviewed a person

00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:13.511 align:middle line:84%
from the City of Hope,
Cancer Research Center

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:18.149 align:middle line:84%
and that doctor told me
specifically, chemo is poison.

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:21.452 align:middle line:84%
That was the word but she said,
"We're working on ways to try

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.121 align:middle line:90%
to avoid all of that."

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:27.091 align:middle line:84%
What they want to do is to be
able to target the cancer cell

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.027 align:middle line:84%
and not all the healthy
cells around it.

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.262 align:middle line:84%
I hope they come up with
something that can do that.

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: They
have treatments like that.

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:37.268 align:middle line:84%
They are very interesting
treatments and that isolation

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:40.071 align:middle line:84%
of the cancerous cell or
that particular tumor depends

00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:41.706 align:middle line:90%
upon location.

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:47.178 align:middle line:84%
Some areas are not optimal
for that kind of a treatment.

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:52.216 align:middle line:84%
For something in the lung you
can do those isolated, you're in

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:57.522 align:middle line:84%
and out the same day or the next
day where they use a laparoscope

00:40:57.522 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:90%
to view where the tumor is

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.794 align:middle line:84%
and then you have something
called radio frequency ablation.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:07.031 align:middle line:84%
They're using microwave
now and this tube go in

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:12.537 align:middle line:84%
and these little wire baskets
will surround that tumor

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:84%
and the radio waves or
microwaves actually heats it

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and that breaks down the
protein in the tumor.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.546 align:middle line:84%
The body absorbs it and
then it's eliminated.

00:41:21.546 --> 00:41:24.816 align:middle line:84%
You can do that but there
are certain other areas

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
where let's say if it's in the
wall of the colon you can wind

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
up with leakage into
the abdominal cavity.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.092 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
had a friend of mine.

00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:37.095 align:middle line:84%
He was an ophthalmologist, went
in for a routine colonoscopy,

00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:40.631 align:middle line:84%
routine and he figured you
know what I've never had this

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.833 align:middle line:90%
done before.

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:44.402 align:middle line:84%
He went to a friend of
his who was another doctor

00:41:44.402 --> 00:41:48.072 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor punctured
his intestine during

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:50.208 align:middle line:90%
this colonoscopy.

00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:56.447 align:middle line:84%
He got septic shock and they
literally had to operate on him.

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:58.149 align:middle line:90%
Cut him from here to here.

00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:02.286 align:middle line:84%
Took the intestine out and
bathed and washed it for a day

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:05.456 align:middle line:84%
or so while this guy
was on some machine

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.358 align:middle line:84%
and then they put
it back into him.

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.359 align:middle line:90%
He's not the same.

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.994 align:middle line:90%
He is all chopped up.

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.598 align:middle line:84%
He's now come up with a hernia
that they put a mesh in on him

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:15.099 align:middle line:84%
and they have to go in
and take that out now.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
But there's a recall.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.502 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yeah,
there's a recall on that.

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:18.736 align:middle line:90%
It's just a disaster.

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:21.539 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Dr. Robin Falkov.

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:22.573 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right here.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.575 align:middle line:84%
>> I enjoy the show
Robin, thank you.

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.676 align:middle line:90%
I have a question.

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:30.181 align:middle line:84%
What's the mechanics
behind acupuncture?

00:42:30.181 --> 00:42:35.086 align:middle line:84%
And also what's the spiritual
implications with acupuncture?

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:38.022 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: A lot
of people swear by it.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes and
those are great questions

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.693 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say I
went back to school

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.896 align:middle line:84%
so that I would have a
comprehensive license

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
as a Doctor of Oriental Medicine
and part of that training is

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.004 align:middle line:84%
that you work with patients in
clinic and I would have patients

00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:56.641 align:middle line:84%
that come in with chronic
problems, five years,

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:00.478 align:middle line:84%
seven years and after three or
four visits they're telling me

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:03.381 align:middle line:84%
that they're better and
I would say, "Really?

00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:04.649 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure?

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:05.683 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure?"

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:10.755 align:middle line:84%
So an easy concept
to consider is just

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:13.157 align:middle line:84%
as we have blood circulating
through our bodies,

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:16.494 align:middle line:84%
we have energies
circulating through our bodies

00:43:16.494 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese have a
written history of medicine

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.432 align:middle line:84%
for over three thousand
dollars years

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:25.136 align:middle line:84%
and those energy pathways
are called meridians.

00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:28.873 align:middle line:84%
And there are specific points
on these specific locations

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:32.343 align:middle line:84%
that coordinate with
different systems of the body

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:35.346 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you determine
how to treat a patient.

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:39.584 align:middle line:84%
So you are tapping into
those energy pathways and one

00:43:39.584 --> 00:43:41.953 align:middle line:84%
of the principles of
Chinese medicine is

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.289 align:middle line:90%
that blockage causes stagnation.

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:50.528 align:middle line:84%
Stagnation, you have swelling,
things don't move, obstructions

00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:55.066 align:middle line:84%
or pain so if you can get
that energy moving and heal

00:43:55.066 --> 00:44:00.471 align:middle line:84%
that blockage that is the
premise for restoring health.

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:02.607 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The needles
that they put into people,

00:44:02.607 --> 00:44:06.244 align:middle line:84%
the acupuncture needle,
they're really fine aren't they?

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:11.782 align:middle line:84%
And they use a little tap
or a hammer to get it in?

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: No.

00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:14.952 align:middle line:84%
I have to say they're all
different sizes and lengths

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:84%
of needles and in China the
traditional Chinese medical

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.093 align:middle line:84%
physicians will use
some very long ones

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:26.164 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually go through
the hand, go through the ankle.

00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:26.664 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Really?

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.065 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: I've had
to use some very long needles

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:33.838 align:middle line:84%
that were a thicker gauge with a
patient who was very overweight

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:35.907 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to do a treatment

00:44:35.907 --> 00:44:39.176 align:middle line:84%
with thickened skin it's
challenging but you--

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:43.948 align:middle line:84%
it's experience to play with
it and once the needles are

00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:49.587 align:middle line:84%
in there's so much that can
be done by your physician

00:44:49.587 --> 00:44:52.623 align:middle line:84%
because you can regulate
how the energy's moving.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:56.627 align:middle line:84%
You can stimulate late it
or you can suppress it.

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:44:57.995 --> 00:45:00.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: So it's
open to fine tuning the needs

00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:04.135 align:middle line:84%
for the patient and that's a big
deal, to have those treatments

00:45:04.135 --> 00:45:07.305 align:middle line:84%
that deal with you
as an individual.

00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:08.372 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yeah,
people swear by it.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.141 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go to our
Beyond Belief cam.

00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:12.343 align:middle line:84%
We've got a question
for Dr. Robin Falkov.

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:17.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey Robin, this is Kelly in
Anchorage and I'm just wondering

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.884 align:middle line:84%
if you think the health
information that's available

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:22.987 align:middle line:84%
to us is going to get
better in the future?

00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:24.622 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was pretty good now

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.793 align:middle line:84%
with the Internet
but maybe it isn't

00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Gosh,

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.963 align:middle line:84%
that's such a big
question George.

00:45:31.963 --> 00:45:34.565 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful question
that Kelly brought up

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:37.668 align:middle line:90%
and what we are looking at

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:41.505 align:middle line:84%
and which is something
I've discussed for years,

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.275 align:middle line:84%
how to protect our
right to have access

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to the necessary information

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.781 align:middle line:84%
to make informed choices there's
lot of information that's not

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.717 align:middle line:90%
out there like it used to be.

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:55.119 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of medical
research papers that you have

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:58.389 align:middle line:84%
to pay a fee in order
to read the paper

00:45:58.389 --> 00:46:00.791 align:middle line:90%
and that can get very pricey.

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:03.928 align:middle line:84%
In the past, I was able to
do a search for patient's

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:07.431 align:middle line:84%
and treatments around
the world and get a list

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.801 align:middle line:84%
of what's being done in
western medical therapy research

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:14.238 align:middle line:84%
and alternative and go
through all of this data.

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:17.642 align:middle line:84%
It's not available because
they have to pay fees.

00:46:17.642 --> 00:46:24.415 align:middle line:84%
So you have the FDA that has
come down on cherry growers,

00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:27.118 align:middle line:90%
on wall nuts, on prunes.

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:31.155 align:middle line:84%
You cannot make these claims for
therapeutic effects from foods

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:34.125 align:middle line:84%
because that would
classify them as drugs.

00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Life Extension Magazine has--

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.263 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Can
you say may help?

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:41.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: There are
so many changes now George.

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:45.836 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you it's, for
everything that I discussed

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:49.507 align:middle line:84%
about Codex they are
in their end game.

00:46:49.507 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Things are disappearing
from the marketplace.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.946 align:middle line:84%
What they've done to restrict
information is let's say there's

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:59.183 align:middle line:84%
a website that's selling
nutritional supplements.

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.253 align:middle line:84%
You want to go and read about
the products and that's covered

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:04.955 align:middle line:84%
by DSHEA which is the
Dietary Supplement Health

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and Education Act that was
passed in I believe 1992,

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.197 align:middle line:84%
by an outstanding response from
the people of this country.

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:19.537 align:middle line:84%
I mean they flooded letters and
faxes and the law was passed.

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:21.272 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly being
challenged.

00:47:21.272 --> 00:47:22.973 align:middle line:84%
We have the Durbin
challenge now.

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:26.577 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's so
much that is going on.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:30.147 align:middle line:84%
So that information
they want to remove

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:34.218 align:middle line:84%
so you can't see what these
supplements can provide.

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:37.154 align:middle line:84%
And the insanity about cherries
and things that have been

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:41.625 align:middle line:84%
around for so long they
have restricted it.

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:44.028 align:middle line:90%
That's not in our best interest.

00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:47.465 align:middle line:84%
You know we need that
information to decide

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:51.035 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and what we're
getting is a nanny government

00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:53.738 align:middle line:84%
that's making the
decisions for us?

00:47:53.738 --> 00:47:55.706 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who wants that?

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.174 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Here's the
one thing I think we need

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to regulate and I don't
know how we do this

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:05.850 align:middle line:84%
without being considered forcing
but to regulate the quality

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.319 align:middle line:84%
of the supplements
that are being made

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:14.258 align:middle line:84%
because how could we decide
whether this turmeric capsule I

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:17.528 align:middle line:84%
take is better than
one that might be made

00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:21.599 align:middle line:84%
in some country and
their crooks.

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.268 align:middle line:84%
You know they're not putting in
the ingredients that we need.

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:28.072 align:middle line:84%
So what about trying to
regulate it, not control it

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
but at least regulate the
quality of what it is?

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:34.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
It's a very touchy point

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:37.848 align:middle line:84%
because that quality control
and that testing can be millions

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:40.084 align:middle line:84%
of dollars and what's
happened in Europe

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:44.421 align:middle line:84%
and other countries is the big
pharmaceutical companies have

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:47.091 align:middle line:90%
absorbed all of these small guys

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:49.326 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
afford to do the testing.

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.594 align:middle line:90%
I think it was four years ago

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:54.398 align:middle line:84%
when they pulled 200
different herbal products

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:57.334 align:middle line:84%
or they only left
200 herbal products

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:00.137 align:middle line:84%
and the rest they said
you have to do the testing

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.673 align:middle line:84%
and these companies didn't
have the money for it.

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:08.679 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fine line and we need
different review committees

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.849 align:middle line:84%
that oversee that
kind of testing

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:14.552 align:middle line:84%
and people need to
read the labels.

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:20.357 align:middle line:84%
But yes it's a real fine
point if the label is honest.

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.459 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But
how do you know that?

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:23.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Yes, I know.

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.396 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: A
reputable company only?

00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:26.797 align:middle line:90%
Somebody like that?

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Well that's
what it gets to at this point.

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.569 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And hope
that they do their homework?

00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:33.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: And
it's kind of challenging

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.872 align:middle line:90%
when so much product is imported

00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:38.075 align:middle line:84%
from China, so much
raw material.

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We
have seen what products

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.712 align:middle line:90%
from China have done to dogs

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.114 align:middle line:84%
with lead tainting
and everything else.

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
The melamine

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.586 align:middle line:84%
to increase the protein
testing that's blown

00:49:48.586 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:84%
out dog's liver's
and killed them.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.758 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is an awful lot
of issues and then we find

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:57.228 align:middle line:84%
out that we're the more
ingredients being produced.

00:49:57.228 --> 00:49:59.496 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the
United States anymore.

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:00.931 align:middle line:90%
They're in China.

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.633 align:middle line:90%
So the good thing, the Chinese,

00:50:02.633 --> 00:50:07.805 align:middle line:84%
when they catch somebody they'll
kill them in their company.

00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:08.939 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah, they will.

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:12.476 align:middle line:84%
Some of these CEOs
they've committed suicide

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:13.911 align:middle line:90%
after an event.

00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:16.213 align:middle line:84%
I mean they take
these things seriously

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yeah
and it should be serious.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.717 align:middle line:90%
Your life is on the line.

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:21.652 align:middle line:84%
Your loved one's
lives are on the line.

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:23.287 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why?

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:25.656 align:middle line:84%
This is what boggles
my mind George.

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:28.893 align:middle line:84%
Why have people accepted
what we have now

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:31.262 align:middle line:90%
when it can be so much better?

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:32.796 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What do
you recommend people do

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:37.101 align:middle line:84%
to better their health, to get
themselves back in a straight

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.436 align:middle line:84%
and narrow path because
I happen to think

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:43.407 align:middle line:84%
that your health beyond your
career is more important

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:47.444 align:middle line:84%
than anything because if you
have loved ones you can't be

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:48.679 align:middle line:90%
there with them.

00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:50.381 align:middle line:84%
You can't be there for
them if you don't take care

00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.683 align:middle line:90%
of yourself first and foremost.

00:50:52.683 --> 00:50:54.852 align:middle line:84%
And you know every day
when I've got a news story

00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:58.055 align:middle line:84%
about this Hollywood actor
has died or this has happened

00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:00.991 align:middle line:84%
to this person or something
like that what go people do

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.227 align:middle line:84%
so that they're doing
it the right way?

00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:04.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Oh, gosh.

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:06.697 align:middle line:90%
You take inventory.

00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:10.634 align:middle line:84%
If you work with someone
like me, I'm not easy.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:13.537 align:middle line:84%
I like to go to the
homes of my patient

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:17.141 align:middle line:84%
or with Skype we can walk
around and go through everything

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:21.111 align:middle line:84%
and examine cleaners
in the home.

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:24.915 align:middle line:84%
The use of pesticides,
personnel care products,

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:28.452 align:middle line:84%
reading the labels because
if you have health conditions

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:31.522 align:middle line:84%
you'll want to remove
all of those burdens

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:33.757 align:middle line:84%
and give you yourself
a chance to heal.

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.326 align:middle line:90%
So you go through that.

00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:37.728 align:middle line:90%
You go through food.

00:51:37.728 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Food is a sensitive subject.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.233 align:middle line:84%
I can say I'm doing
it for everyone

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.669 align:middle line:90%
that says, oh, it's impossible.

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.404 align:middle line:84%
In September it will
be two years

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:90%
that my diet is raw and people--

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:50.741 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
it works for you.

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:51.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
It works for me.

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.677 align:middle line:84%
People look at me
like I'm an alien.

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.012 align:middle line:90%
It's challenging.

00:51:55.012 --> 00:51:58.482 align:middle line:84%
Well, oh but we have some
steamed vegetables or whatever.

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The people that I've seen on
raw diets the clock stops.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.856 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they started
the clock stops

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:08.559 align:middle line:84%
and then things can
even go back.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:10.027 align:middle line:90%
So you're lifestyle.

00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:10.794 align:middle line:90%
What's in your home?

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.096 align:middle line:90%
What's in your workplace?

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:16.266 align:middle line:84%
You have to examine that the
kind of clothing you wear,

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.235 align:middle line:84%
the supplements that
you're taking,

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:23.607 align:middle line:84%
the food that you're eating, all
of these areas and the water,

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.843 align:middle line:90%
the basic water that you drink.

00:52:25.843 --> 00:52:27.144 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: The pH level.

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Yes,
for your body to measure pH,

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.148 align:middle line:90%
for what you're consuming,

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:33.884 align:middle line:84%
what you're cooking,
what you're bathing.

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.487 align:middle line:84%
Just think about what
happens in the shower.

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:41.492 align:middle line:84%
Your pores are dilated and
there's so many toxic chemicals.

00:52:41.492 --> 00:52:44.728 align:middle line:84%
They get sucked in through
all those dilated pores

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:48.198 align:middle line:84%
from the heat and
you're poisoning yourself

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.266 align:middle line:90%
in the shower.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.769 align:middle line:84%
So shower filtration
units are important,

00:52:51.769 --> 00:52:53.570 align:middle line:90%
filtration units for the house.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.008 align:middle line:84%
There's all different ways and
different choices but you've got

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:01.779 align:middle line:84%
to look at your foundation
and then you've got

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:04.348 align:middle line:84%
to know what you're
neighbors are doing.

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:06.417 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're in an
apartment building some

00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:10.320 align:middle line:84%
of them routinely come through
and spray with pesticides

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.956 align:middle line:84%
for the apartments that want
it but meanwhile it goes

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:15.159 align:middle line:84%
through the air conditioning
systems.

00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:17.494 align:middle line:90%
So you have to troubleshoot.

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:20.197 align:middle line:84%
You can take it to
a greater length.

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:22.733 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a state like
Florida where they do spraying

00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:26.103 align:middle line:84%
for mosquitos and ask
that you be called.

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:29.339 align:middle line:84%
I mean just think about all of
the animals that are outside.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.542 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Oh, my
God your dog or walking.

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:32.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Or their food

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.278 align:middle line:84%
or you're walking
with your animal.

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:36.747 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And here comes
the mosquito spraying man.

00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:40.250 align:middle line:90%
You remember drive-in theatres?

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.151 align:middle line:90%
Do they still have those?

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.052 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.420 align:middle line:90%
But do you remember?

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.989 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting in your car,
your parents are in the front.

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.524 align:middle line:90%
The windows are down.

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
It's a hot summer day and
there's a truck out there

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:53.397 align:middle line:84%
with the mosquito spray just
shooting all over the lot

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:56.834 align:middle line:84%
and we're breathing
all this stuff.

00:53:56.834 --> 00:54:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Show of hands, how many of
you really think you take care

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.773 align:middle line:90%
of yourself health-wise?

00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:04.308 align:middle line:90%
That's less than half, Robin.

00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:05.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
But that's impressive.

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:06.677 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You really think so?

00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:08.579 align:middle line:90%
I think it's too low.

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.481 align:middle line:84%
Everybody should
have their hands up.

00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:11.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
But everybody doesn't.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.717 align:middle line:84%
This is, you've got
quite an audience.

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:84%
This is impressive that
you have these numbers

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.789 align:middle line:84%
that really feel
they're doing a good job.

00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:21.725 align:middle line:84%
It's challenging and
there's pressure.

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:23.093 align:middle line:90%
There's pressure from families.

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.228 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:54:24.228 --> 00:54:26.096 align:middle line:84%
What's the big deal if
you cheat a little bit?

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:29.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can eat this once
in a while or you can do this

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.802 align:middle line:90%
or can use this product.

00:54:31.802 --> 00:54:35.806 align:middle line:84%
We have to respect each other
and respect our choices.

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:39.042 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to see
everybody with their hands up.

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:41.145 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When
we get to a certain age

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:45.182 align:middle line:84%
in our lives we are going
down the home stretch

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:48.752 align:middle line:84%
and you know you have a
certain window of life.

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:52.789 align:middle line:84%
When I was 20, I thought
30 was the end of time.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:57.327 align:middle line:84%
When I was 30, I thought
40, gosh that's old.

00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:59.096 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that way anymore.

00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:02.566 align:middle line:84%
Now it's just to enjoy
life for the rest

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:04.768 align:middle line:90%
of whatever time we have left.

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I keep looking at the story of
Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I was with him in Beverly
Hills a few months ago.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:14.845 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful guy.

00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:16.346 align:middle line:90%
51 years old.

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.948 align:middle line:90%
Who would have thought that?

00:55:17.948 --> 00:55:20.884 align:middle line:84%
Overweight, didn't
seem to be healthy,

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:23.954 align:middle line:84%
abused himself a little bit
too much I think with drinking

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:28.125 align:middle line:84%
and he died just like that,
had a wonderful future.

00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:30.194 align:middle line:90%
He had everything he wanted.

00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:31.795 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.564 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
care of yourself.

00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:34.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Definitely.

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:38.468 align:middle line:84%
You never know what
can happen tomorrow.

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:41.071 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to get the
most out of life, yes,

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.206 align:middle line:90%
take care of yourself.

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:46.543 align:middle line:84%
Exercise. We are
such a lazy country.

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:49.346 align:middle line:84%
I think the good news is we
finally have another country

00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:52.182 align:middle line:84%
that surpassed us in
the obesity level.

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.518 align:middle line:84%
So we're not number
one there anymore

00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:58.288 align:middle line:84%
but exercise be it
walking, be it,

00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:01.058 align:middle line:84%
I love the little
mini-trampolines.

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:04.595 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty hard for anyone to
have an excuse not to use that

00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:06.997 align:middle line:90%
and I try to use that every day.

00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:08.465 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You jump
on a little trampoline?

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:10.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
I jog because I've--

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:11.301 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
don't fall off it?

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:12.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: No.

00:56:12.002 --> 00:56:13.937 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't fall off it.

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:18.308 align:middle line:84%
But because I've done years
of ballet and martial arts

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:21.812 align:middle line:84%
and horseback riding I have
all different aches and pains

00:56:21.812 --> 00:56:25.816 align:middle line:84%
so bouncing up and down is
like oh, it's like going

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:27.618 align:middle line:90%
through your life experience.

00:56:27.618 --> 00:56:30.721 align:middle line:90%
Jogging lightly on it is great.

00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:32.055 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:35.592 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't hurt and it's just
so beneficial for the body

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to help you detox and move all
the waste out of your body.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.932 align:middle line:84%
Because where are
most of us every day?

00:56:41.932 --> 00:56:45.902 align:middle line:84%
In front of our computers, a
big block of our time is spent

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.938 align:middle line:84%
in front of our computers
sitting.

00:56:47.938 --> 00:56:51.675 align:middle line:84%
So taking a little break
and using a mini-trampoline.

00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:54.978 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the gym, if you
have equipment, if you hike

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:57.714 align:middle line:90%
but you've got to do something.

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: People want
information on what you do

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.517 align:middle line:90%
and the things you do.

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:01.451 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Okay.

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.353 align:middle line:90%
I'm easy to find.

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:06.356 align:middle line:84%
Healthfreedomrights.com
is my website.

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:09.993 align:middle line:84%
I have a radio show "What
They Don't Want You to Know."

00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:16.266 align:middle line:90%
I answer all my e-mails.

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:25.275 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Super, Dr.
Robin Falkov on Beyond Belief.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Robin [applause]

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:26.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov:
Thank you George.

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:27.811 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure.

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:28.345 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You're the best.

00:57:28.345 --> 00:57:28.845 align:middle line:90%
Great show.

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Super job.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Robin Falkov: Thank you.
