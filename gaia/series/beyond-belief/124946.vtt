>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
great parts of what I do

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:84%
is interviewing
people who are experts

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.555 align:middle line:84%
in subjects that are so dear
to me, like remote viewing.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: He is said to
be the foremost authority

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.111 align:middle line:90%
on remote viewing.

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Marty Rosenblatt is president
of the Applied Precognition

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Project and editor of online
magazine, "Connections Through

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Time."

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
He believes consciousness
is non-local.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It is not confined to
a physical place, which

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
makes it possible to view
distant events-- past, present,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and future-- and
while he recognizes

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that psychics have hit a
wall, with most at around 55%

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
to 65% accuracy,
Marty believes we're

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
on the brink of a paradigm
shift that will allow psychics

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:90%
to achieve 80% accuracy.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
He explains how increasing
empathy improves forecasting

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:90%
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Marty Rosenblatt.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Marty, welcome to the program.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.168 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTY ROSENBLATT: Thank
you, a pleasure to be here.

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just
love remote viewing.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:90%
I really, really love it.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's terrific.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do, too.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just fantastic
what the mind can do.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a physicist.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: I am.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in remote viewing?

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.665 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
not something that

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:90%
would naturally evolve for you.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well, I have
always been interested

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
in things like science
fiction, so I have always

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
had kind of a natural
inclination for things

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
right at the edge and to try
to figure out what's real

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
or what's not real.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, you start
reading a lot of information,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and remote viewing
was one of them.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.976 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm a working
physicist with clearances.

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It turns out I was
involved with the DIA, just

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
as a subcontractor,
and I saw this paper

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
by Hal Puthoff and
Russ Targ which

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
talked about remote viewing.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Part of the fathers of
remote viewing and, of course,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:90%
the late Ingo Swann.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Exactly,
exactly, so I actually

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
went to my contacts
at DNA, and I said,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
you guys need to
know about this.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they were
funding it at the time.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
sent me to SRI,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
where Puthoff and Targ were.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
met them, and then,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
of course, from then on--
this was in the late '70s,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess-- from then
on, I have just

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
been fascinated with the
subject and taking it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:90%
on in a very serious way.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For people
who don't know,

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
our government, after the
Soviets got involved in this,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
put together a remote
viewing program

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:84%
with the Ingo Swanns
and the Hal Puthoffs

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and the Russell
Targs because they

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
wanted to beat the Russians at
something that was going on.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I want you, Marty, to explain
to us, what is remote viewing?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK,
remote viewing is

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
like the gathering
of information

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
at a distance via
what I guess could be

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
called paranormal techniques.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Now by distance--
and this is what's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
so important-- we
mean not only space,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
but we mean time, past,
present, and future.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And distance exceeds the planet.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Ingo Swann did a great
remote viewing session

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
on the planet Jupiter where
he predicted the rings

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
around Jupiter which
later the Voyager saw.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking basically
getting information

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
from virtually
anywhere, anytime.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Now paranormal
means, I really want

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to define that because I
believe remote viewing is

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
a natural capability
we all have.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
The only reason it's
called paranormal

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.196 align:middle line:84%
is because it's not
accepted by our society.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
remote viewing is.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a
lot of them aren't

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:11.682 align:middle line:90%
aware of this gift we have.

00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's
exactly right.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.556 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
always called what

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
we tap into the wireless
internet in the universe.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
To me, that makes a lot of sense
because we're all connected.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:90%
You're connected to me.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm connected to Ellie, one
of our production managers.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected through
this wireless internet that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
just permeates the
universe, and I'm

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
convinced that extraterrestrials
that are out there

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.796 align:middle line:90%
were hooked into them, too.

00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: I agree with that.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.546 align:middle line:84%
I use somewhat different
terms, but really it

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:90%
means the same thing.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I say, consciousness
is the fundamental.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
All sentient beings, anyone
who has consciousness,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
any entities, animals, too,
of course, insects, of course,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
ETs, yes, all that
consciousness,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
all of those conscious
moments, we have

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
a conscious moment right now.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That conscious moment
gets stored in a universe

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
of collective consciousness.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the fundamental.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Everything we know,
we know through

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
our conscious awareness,
and that's shareable.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's amazing.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can tap
into that with what

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
we call remote viewing,
clairvoyance, precognition.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We're tapping into
this wireless universe,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
collective
consciousness universe.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can remote viewing
take you into the future,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.064 align:middle line:90%
into the past?

00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Absolutely,
I mean, that's what we do.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
My focus is on what's
called precognition,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
which is this ability to gather
information from the future.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is so significant

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
because if you really
get into the fact--

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's now been demonstrated
in multiple places.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.425 align:middle line:84%
Stanford Research
Institute did studies.

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Princeton University, one
of their groups there,

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the para group, did studies
showing that, indeed,

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:90%
precognition is real.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
That means we can gather
information from the future,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and that information is
coming back in the present

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:90%
and influencing us.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing gift.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: It
changes what we usually

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:90%
think of as cause and effect.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The future is affecting this
now moment as much as the past.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
That's remarkable, and we are
connected with it all now.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it that
some people are better at it

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:90%
than others?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: I do believe
there is a natural talent.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
just better at it

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
when they get to be old enough
to start using it directly.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, especially
in our society,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
children are taught
to turn it off.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's crazy.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe your dreams,
thing of that sort,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
so they're taught
to turn it off.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even with their
little imaginary friends.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.205 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Exactly, stuff
like that, and I believe--

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually
controversial-- I

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
believe it can be trained.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
In the work we do, we see
people getting better at it,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
better at it as they
do it more and as they

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:90%
want to get better at it.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The only limits that you
really put on yourself

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.112 align:middle line:90%
are from yourself.

00:07:36.112 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a few minutes, Marty,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at
some images that I

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
want you to discuss with us in
terms of who these people are,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:84%
what they do, and
what they bring

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to the table for remote viewing.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to our
first one here.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the very
first remote viewers

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.134 align:middle line:84%
and some of the key players
that you just mentioned.

00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK, on the left
is Hal Puthoff back in 1973.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
This program started in
right about that time frame,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
1972 or so.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Hal Puthoff was a director
at the Stanford Research

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a group
of scientists that

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
came from Stanford University,
so high level scientists.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
They got involved in
lots of different work,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
including classified work,
and the guy next to Hal

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:90%
is Kit Green, who is a CIA.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.084 align:middle line:84%
He was the connection with
the CIA very early on.

00:08:35.084 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boy, they took
this seriously, didn't they?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: They took
all of this seriously.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There were many people
who kept not believing it,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
but it was funded for over 20
years, which is rather amazing.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And it had many high-level
scientific committees,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
all trying to find flaws
in it, not believing it,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
but, indeed, it just
turned out to be true.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next person
was our buddy, Russell Targ.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Next to that
was Russell Targ, who worked

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:90%
with Hal for most of the time.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Hal was the head of it, but Rus
was, like, his first deputy.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And they did a tremendous
amount of work in this area.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.524 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's nearly blind now.

00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Correct.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.214 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And rides a motorcycle.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Correct.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because he
uses his remote viewing

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:90%
to get him around.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT:
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's like a bat
with a signal that goes out.

00:09:24.854 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Exactly.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable,
and then the last person

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.859 align:middle line:90%
is-- who is that?

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's Pat Price.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
He was a retired Oakland
detective, one of the best

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.035 align:middle line:90%
remote viewers ever.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A detective?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: He
was a detective.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
He used to use his
intuition in solving crimes.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: But
he was retired.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.715 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
exactly who found him,

00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
but he did some of
the most amazing work,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
including reading files
inside sealed file cabinets

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.972 align:middle line:90%
in top-secret facilities.

00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he was accurate.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: When
he first did this,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
the security people
came out, and they

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
were sure there was a
major security leak.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
would think that.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: This
is impossible.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And in
many ways, that probably

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
incidents that really

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:90%
helped keep the funding going.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, hey, if
he could do that,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
what if the Russians
could do that?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the most
amazing stories in this,

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and that really kicked this off.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.234 align:middle line:90%
And that was in the early '70s.

00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, our
next image, of course,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the military trained
remote viewers.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at that and
have you explain to us, Marty,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: This
is in, like, 2000--

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I recognize
all these people.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That's Russell on
the far right, right?

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And Hal
Puthoff on the left.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:90%
So they've aged now.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.189 align:middle line:90%
This is in, like, 2002 or so.

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's the
guy in the middle?

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: An
IRVA conference,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
which shows that this
has now gotten out there.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the guy in the
middle was also

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:90%
involved at the very beginning.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've seen him.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's
Ingo Swann himself.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.403 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's him.

00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:07.167 align:middle line:84%
He still looks young
in that picture.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's true.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.756 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
He was so instrumental.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
He actually taught the
scientists so much.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
One of his very famous
sayings is, the remote viewer

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:90%
should be in charge.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
scientist kept saying,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:90%
you do it this way.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:90%
You do it this way.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Relax, guys.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:90%
The remote viewer is in charge.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Let me kind of set
up the rules, which

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:90%
were very free form for him.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our next visual
I want people to look at

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is the question, can
anyone do remote viewing?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.562 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look at this.

00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at here, Marty?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: This is from
one of our-- let me call

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
it average, normal,
off-the-street street people

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:90%
that join us in our work.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
examples of remote viewing

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that the professionals
do, like Ingo,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
like Joe McMoneagle, the
well-known professionals,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and they are right on.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
This is one which I like to
show as an example of what

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:84%
anyone who is trained
and interested in doing

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:90%
this might do.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The picture on the
right was totally

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
blind to the remote viewer.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
His task was to describe
and sketch this photo.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.547 align:middle line:90%
We call it a photo site.

00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they
didn't know what it was.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: It was totally
blind, so that was his job.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I happened to be a judge.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
which of two pictures

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it was going to be
because we apply this

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to sporting events
and financial events

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:90%
where there are two choices.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what we
have a judge involved.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Now my point is, totally blind,
I'm sitting here as a judge,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and I see that picture
on the left, wow.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A hand coming down
from a cloud, which looks

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:90%
like that picture on the right.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And, in
fact, when I saw that hand,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was the hand
of God because I hadn't even

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
looked at the picture yet.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was blind
to the picture.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.228 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at the fingers.

00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at the bottom of the photo.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Yeah, I do, the,
like, stem, the top of the stem

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
there and then the second
one with the long stem.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's how good that is.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
People can do, not the
professionals, normal people

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
off the street can do this.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them don't even
know they can do this.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I wonder
what the people who

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.387 align:middle line:84%
did those two sketches did when
they saw that actual photo.

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Were they mystified?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Were they, like, in shock?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.256 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God, look what I did.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: When
they see the photo--

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's called feedback.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
We give it to them, and that's
exactly how a lot of them

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:90%
respond at first.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They are just so
pleased and excited,

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's a
demonstration for them.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And all the talking that
we're doing about this,

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing like getting
a session that's this good.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Now they're not all this good.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was good.

00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: But
this one is very good.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll come back
to some more images,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
but let's take a look
at a technologist who

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
predicted how the world
will end with the backing

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of some scientific evidence.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.584 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK.

00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:21.959 align:middle line:84%
>>TECHNOLOGIST: The biggest
danger to life as we know it,

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.332 align:middle line:84%
I think, a really big
asteroid heads for Earth.

00:14:24.332 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
In 1908, just a 200-foot
piece of a comet

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
exploded over Siberia
and flattened forests

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:90%
for maybe 100 miles.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It had the effect of about
1,000 Hiroshima bombs.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, a large asteroid passed
400,000 miles away from Earth.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to worry about, right?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It passed directly
through Earth's orbit.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We were in that spot
six hours earlier.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a chart that Dr. Clark
Chapman of the Southwestern

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Research Institute presented
to Congress a few years ago.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that the chance
of an asteroid slash comet

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
impact killing you is about 1
in 20,000, according to the work

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
they've done.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Now look at the one right
below that-- passenger aircraft

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:90%
crash, 1 in 20,000.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
We spend an awful
lot of money trying

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to be sure that we don't
die in airplane accidents,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.101 align:middle line:84%
and we're not spending
hardly anything on this.

00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So can be remote
viewers and people who

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
are experts in precognition,
can they see that happening?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.322 align:middle line:84%
Can they see this asteroid
that nearly missed us?

00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That
kind of question

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
is a very interesting
question because can they?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
In principle, yes, but you have
to think about how you would

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:90%
frame that kind of question.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And can they pinpoint
the time frame?

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of remote
viewers have a difficult time

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.242 align:middle line:90%
pinpointing time.

00:15:49.242 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's
exactly right.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Plus, what you
have to realize is

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
there are no remote
viewers who are 100%.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewing is an ability.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
When you see examples,
even like the one we saw,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:90%
you know it's real.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was
precognitive, so, yes, you

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
could get the information
from the future.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
A major event like
an impact like

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that, if it were,
God forbid, to occur,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is out there because
the future is out there.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But how would you
ask the question?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
about earthquakes.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I live in Southern California.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Someday, I do believe
we will get to the point

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:84%
where we can predict
the earthquakes.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be a
valuable thing to do?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some do.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Some do.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Yeah, but
how accurate are they?

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I've got one guy.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:90%
He's a geologist.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
His name is Jim Berkland,
and he's pretty good.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
He predicted the San
Francisco earthquake

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
during a baseball game
in the Oakland Bay Area.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:90%
He uses techniques, though.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:90%
He's not a remote viewer.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Right,
he's using technology.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He uses technology.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
He looks for classified
stories of missing animals.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:84%
People say, you know, do you
know where my dog, Fido, is,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:90%
or my cat?

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
And if he sees a lot of
these missing animal reports,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
he thinks there's going
to be an earthquake,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.504 align:middle line:90%
and he's been right quite a bit.

00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: See,
so he's tapping

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
into this consciousness,
just like the animals.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The tsunami in Japan, the
recent one, the animals

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:90%
went up the hill.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.204 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the one in
Indonesia, elephants and tigers

00:17:24.204 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
headed for the hills.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Exactly,
so it shows you

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:90%
the information is out there.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But to get to the
point where we could

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
use it and evacuate a city,
we're just not there yet.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think being able to get
that time slice narrow enough

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:84%
so we as a society would be
willing to say, OK, everybody,

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
it's going to occur
within the next 10 days,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
leave in an orderly
fashion, which

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
is the dream-- we'd love to be
able to do that-- we're just

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
not there yet.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think we will
get there eventually,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
as society begins to accept
this view that consciousness

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:90%
is fundamental.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Precognition is real.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people start doing it

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:84%
because then you can get larger
groups of people focusing

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
on these sorts of
things and begin

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:90%
to build up your confidence.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marty, the old saying,
would've, could've, should've,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
we have this little
voice in us that

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
tells us to do certain things.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us just
don't react to it.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't deliver on it until
after, and then we say, gosh.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:90%
We would've, should've.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
We could've, but
we didn't do it.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that remote viewing?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Is that something telling us?

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:90%
We just don't recognize it.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Often it is,
just like the gut instincts,

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:90%
all of that stuff.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the things people
that work with us who do this

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
regularly-- see this
is the beauty of it.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You begin to learn to trust
that because you see that it

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:90%
is accurate quite often.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not
100%, and that's what

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
makes this field a little bit
tough for others to accept.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, yeah,
precognition, sure,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
but they want it to
be right all the time.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Living with uncertainty
is part of the challenge

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have moving
into the future here.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is sketching
by remote viewers

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:90%
so important to what we do here?

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: It really is.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Sketches come up from a deep
sort of creative part of us.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tend to go through
the intellect in the same way

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:90%
words and thoughts do.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things
that remote viewers are all

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
told to do is to set aside
the intellect, the ego,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and just let the
information kind of bubble

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
up from the subconscious,
the submerged consciousness.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're only
conscious in the moment.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
It's this moment where
your consciousness is.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Memories, they're not here now.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They're in this
submerged consciousness

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
field, which is the same
place future information is.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you get quiet,
and you listen quietly.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of all the
chatter, and then what comes up

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
is what you report.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And visuals that come up,
visual people have, I think,

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:90%
a real advantage.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But many people do get
words, and they get a sense

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
by doing this over and
over that the words are

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
coming from the subconscious
rather than the intellect.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of the training.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Consciousness,
of course,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do
with this, everything.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Who designed this?

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Was it a god that put
this all together?

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
This is not a fluke
of nature, Marty.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:90%
This is not an accident.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
To have this ability
to do remote viewing

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
or to be precognitive,
that just doesn't happen.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:90%
You are a scientist.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be wrestling
with this all the time.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Totally,
and I will give you

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
my best answer to
that which is one

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons I came to
this idea of consciousness

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:90%
is the fundamental.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It's as far down as you
can go to an explanation.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
The physical world is created
from our consciousness--

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:84%
past, present, and future--
but who's doing that?

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all the conscious
beings in there now moments.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
All that we really know for
sure and all that really exists

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:90%
is this conscious moment.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's very creative.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We have free will in
this conscious moment.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
This conscious moment is not
only affected by the past.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:90%
It's affected by the future.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We create that future, just
like we created the past.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
All of that, all
of that together,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:84%
all the sentient
beings, anything

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that has consciousness,
all together,

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:90%
that's my definition of God.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So the universe of
collective consciousness,

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:84%
which is all of this,
which is now being created,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
right now we're part of
creating this universe.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's outside of space and time.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It was the thing which
created space and time,

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
so it is godlike in the sense
that you think of God as having

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:90%
created the physical world.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, this universal
collective consciousness

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is outside of space
and time, right?

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, absolutely.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.491 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's
as close as I can come

00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to saying, that's what God is.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the end
of this program,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give people
some tips on what they can do

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and where they can go to
better their remote viewing

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.346 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
look at another video

00:22:58.346 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because some people want to
use this to make monetary gain.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
They want to predict what the
financial markets are like,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and they use remote viewing.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ECONOMIST: My
prediction for 2016

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
is that at least
one member country

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of the group of 20 leading
countries, leading economies,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
will go to the International
Monetary Fund for a rescue.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Many are affected by the
collapse of commodity prices.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
In many countries, there
has been very large amounts

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:90%
of borrowing.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
There is real risk that
at least in one of them,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps more
than one of them,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
there will be a severe
balance of payments

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.661 align:middle line:90%
and financial crisis.

00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to get one
of those talking newspaper.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty cool.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.817 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:23:43.817 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Right.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So is he predicting?

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:90%
What's he doing?

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: I don't
know how he did it.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
people-- in fact,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
they're called futurists--
who use data, and just

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
using the data, will
make predictions.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to
make a prediction.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Based on hard data.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Based on hard
data and trend lines and things

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of that sort.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he did that
or if he used remote viewing,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
but I will tell you that
Russell Targ used remote viewing

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in the silvers market
and made $100,000

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
or so using remote
viewing directly.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the sort of
thing that we're doing now.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Notice this prediction
was still rather vague,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:84%
but it was specific
enough to know,

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:84%
though I'm not sure he
said what time frame.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he said a year.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I prefer-- and notice
Russell also was doing

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.289 align:middle line:90%
this on a short time frame.

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And you want to know why?

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:90%
So he can get data.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
We are doing things over
periods measured in days.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We will make a
prediction on, say,

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
will the Standard and Poor
index, Dow Jones index,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:90%
go up 1/2% or down 1/2%.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Which will happen first,
so that we can buy or sell?

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:90%
And we get feedback.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:90%
We get real data.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And our viewers get
pictures over and over

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
so they can do this
on a regular basis.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very
important to get better at it.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, Joe McMoneagle still
to this day-- Joe McMoneagle,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.504 align:middle line:84%
as you know, is one
of the most famous--

00:25:27.504 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of the fathers.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the groups
of remove viewing.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Right,
and he still does it.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:90%
He's on TV.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
He does remote viewing,
lots of TV programs.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He does six a week.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:90%
He tries to do one a day.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's practice,
practice, practice.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he ask
himself the question,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
or does he just
open up his mind?

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: He's
got a business

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:52.532 align:middle line:84%
where people come to
him, but he doesn't like

00:25:52.532 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:90%
to know what the question is.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:90%
He wants to do them blind.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So all of his viewing
is done totally blind,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
basically keying
in to the customer.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he once told
me what he basically

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
does is say, what is it that
will make the customer happy?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
What does the customer
really want to know?

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the financial
field, we're

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
doing this using a
photograph, like you

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
saw an example earlier, but
it's really a photo site.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Our remote viewers go to a
physical location at that time

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:90%
the picture was taken.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:90%
So what they get sounds.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:90%
They get smells.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They get textures, everything
that their normal senses can

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But that information
is coming from

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.186 align:middle line:84%
the submerged consciousness,
from the subconscious.

00:26:50.186 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far out have
you seen remote viewers go,

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:90%
in terms of time?

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.696 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of years?

00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: You see
the problem with that--

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and there are examples
like that, going back.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Look, there were biblical
references to precognitions,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.949 align:middle line:90%
prophets, the oracles of Delphi.

00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
Book of Revelations.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: The Book
of Revelations, and those

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
were over many,
many, many years.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But in our time,
scientific studies

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:90%
have been done by Princeton.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a par group there,
anomalous research group

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
at Princeton.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They call it the
Princeton Eggs, right?

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call it.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well,
that was something else.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.298 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
we could talk about.

00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a global effect.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Global
Consciousness Program.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's right,
but part of that same group

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
were studies where
they did precognition

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:90%
over different time periods.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:90%
They saw no decline up to weeks.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They never studied it
over longer periods,

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and again because it's
hard to get enough data.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
When you start doing it
over a long period of time,

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
you have these great
examples, but you don't

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.640 align:middle line:90%
get good statistical data.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.394 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is critical, too,
right, backing it up with that?

00:28:08.394 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well,
it is critical

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
because we really
want to get more

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and more scientists
involved in this.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:84%
One of my biggest
disappointments

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist is
that science has,

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
using all the scientific
techniques-- replication,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:84%
double-blind studies,
et cetera, et cetera--

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
have proven that
precognition is real.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists
will not accept it.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hands off.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's right.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hands off.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some more
of our graphics for us.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
This one, of course, is, how
accurate are your groups,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.664 align:middle line:84%
and can we use remote
viewing to make money?

00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about that,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.737 align:middle line:84%
but let's take a look at
what we're looking at here.

00:28:45.737 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: So that's a chart.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which shows us what?

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK,
and don't get hung up

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
by the chart and graphics
because it's really

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:90%
very simple.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:84%
On the left is what
we call hit rate.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we ask,
over and over again,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
our remote viewers
to predict sporting

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:90%
events or financial events.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:90%
They either get a hit.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:90%
They predict it correctly.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You could have wagered on
it and made money on it.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they give
you scores, too, or just

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:16.820 align:middle line:90%
the winner?

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: No just whether
something like does the market

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:90%
move up or down?

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
These are what we
call binary events.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's up or down.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Team A wins.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.175 align:middle line:90%
Team B wins.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
They get over a
certain number of runs

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
or under a certain
number of runs,

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
strictly binary, always
have a clear outcome.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So you know whether you
got a hit or a miss.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and in, let's
say, a hockey game, predicting

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:90%
a winner, you are at 50%.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.947 align:middle line:84%
You either pick one team
or the other, right?

00:29:43.947 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: No,
actually that's not right.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That's still binary,
two choices, but the 50%

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:84%
would be the odds makers who
are very good at this would say,

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the score is going to
be over-- in hockey

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.756 align:middle line:84%
the probably low score
is two points or three.

00:29:58.756 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that
changes things.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Right.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.898 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you were
merely just predicting

00:30:01.898 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
by remote viewing the winner,
if you get anything over 50%,

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.012 align:middle line:84%
then I would think you would
say, something's working here.

00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's
exactly right.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And the 50% mark is
what you'd expect

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
to be random in all of this.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's the hit rate.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, they are
predicting pictures.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They're not predicting
the up or down directly.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They are predicting
one of two pictures,

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
one which is associated
with the market moving up,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:90%
the other, down.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:84%
They, with a judge in between,
now have the hit rate,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and the curve there
on the bottom axis

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:90%
is the trial number.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So here is an example that
went out to 100 trials.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Notice early on, they
were below 50-50.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:90%
They were down to 35%.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:90%
They weren't doing well.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.604 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was horrible.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: There is
some learning going on.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.274 align:middle line:90%
So this is cumulative.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
they got better.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.273 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Then you can see
them getting better and better.

00:31:03.273 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:84%
By the end, by the time
there were 100 sessions,

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the odds versus chance of doing
this well were 1,500 to 1.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
amazing, truly amazing.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: That is amazing.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
to our next graphic.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.116 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking a little
bit about precognition here,

00:31:22.116 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and what are we
looking at, Marty?

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: OK, precognition,
getting information

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
from the future,
the way we do it,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
feedback is a
critical part of this.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Namely, the viewer,
after the event is over,

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
will see the picture associated
with the actual outcome,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:90%
whether it went up or down.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Now he is seeing the picture.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the feedback.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The model is a
telepathic kind of model

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:84%
because he's sharing that
information with himself

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:90%
at an earlier time.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's precognition
because there's a connection

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.844 align:middle line:90%
with the present time.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
When he does his
remote viewing session,

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
when he writes down the sketches
and the words and all that,

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that's happening now, but that's
connected with the feedback

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:84%
time when he sees
the actual picture.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.770 align:middle line:90%
And the information is shared.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
called entanglement

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:90%
in quantum mechanical terms.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes,
quantum entanglement.

00:32:30.609 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: That's called
quantum entanglement,

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and that's what's going on here.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
We like to call it
precognitive telepathy

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's between conscious
minds, your own conscious mind,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:90%
two times.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've interviewed
remote viewers on my show,

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I do a
little game with them

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and I try to remote
view were they

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
are, doing this late-night
radio interview with me.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.819 align:middle line:84%
And I've been pretty
accurate on that.

00:32:56.819 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:90%
One guy, I said, you know what?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You're on a couch in
a room with almost

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:84%
like a globe and a
bookcase in the background.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.465 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my
God, you're right,

00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:90%
you know, from a remote viewer.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to go through some
emails for you, Marty.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:84%
From Carrie in
Minnesota, she says,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.370 align:middle line:84%
what's the best way
for a person to tap

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:21.206 align:middle line:84%
into themselves to get what it
really takes to remote view?

00:33:21.206 --> 00:33:23.525 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: You know,
they've done studies

00:33:23.525 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
on what works best,
the kind of person that

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
can do best at this,
and it turns out

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:90%
there are two things which help.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is number one.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, getting
quiet, so you

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
open yourself up
to the connection

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:90%
with your own subconscious.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And being positive.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.775 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And having
a positive attitude.

00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's critical.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.855 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: In
fact, the entanglement

00:33:47.855 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about, positive
attitude, in fact, I'd

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:84%
like to bring love into this
because what better connection?

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:84%
If you can feel this
loving connection

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:84%
between the remote viewing time
and when you get your feedback,

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:90%
that'll actually enhance things.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one happens
to be just what you said.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It's confidence in your
own-- I like to use the word

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
creativity, being able to know
that from your subconscious

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is coming this remarkable
information in a creative way

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:90%
through your own psyche.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.766 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through you.

00:34:22.766 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly, George
in Tallahassee, good email,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
wants to know, how do we know
that our enemies aren't using

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.167 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing to hurt us?

00:34:32.167 --> 00:34:35.356 align:middle line:90%


00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well, we
don't know it for sure.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the matter is,
as we share this more and more

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
with society, the people that
we consider our enemies will

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.634 align:middle line:90%
probably pick up on it.

00:34:50.634 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
doing the same thing.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:90%
We're doing the same thing.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: We just
have to accept that.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any
reason to think they're not.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
use remote viewing?

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought that you're
doing it to see, to see things.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But can you influence things
through remote viewing?

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Remote influencing
is a very, very interesting

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
concept.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.725 align:middle line:84%
I believe the answer
to that is, yes.

00:35:16.725 --> 00:35:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like entering
dream states of individuals

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and changing how they
think or their mindset.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: You're
influencing how they think.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the now moment
only happens in one way.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.326 align:middle line:84%
So you may become a
participant in it.

00:35:32.326 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:90%
You can't change it.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Influence is just
the right word.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
what I used to do,

00:35:38.378 --> 00:35:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Marty, is I would concentrate
on certain things, individuals,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:84%
for things that I needed
to happen in my life.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And as far-fetched as it may
seem, some of these people

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know me,
but I knew that they

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
were decision makers for
things I needed to accomplish.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So I would go to sleep
and think of them.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it's remote viewing.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Think of them.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Think of their brain.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Think of who they were.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would send these messages
out, you know, call him.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Call George Noory in the
morning and get this done,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:90%
whatever the project was.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, the
phone would ring.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Hey, George, this is Bob Smith.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking about
the proposal you sent me.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's move forward on that.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: How does that
work is a tougher question,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.344 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that it
does work is amazing.

00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does work.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.551 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: And it does work.

00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Remote influencing works.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't really been
studied scientifically,

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:90%
but I believe it does work.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I believe at the
subconscious level

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:84%
there was actually an agreement
with the person that called you

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:90%
in your example.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:84%
There was an
agreement with that.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But this gets very
controversial because now you

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:90%
are influencing another person.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Was it against his will?

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Would he, in fact, agree to do?

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe he didn't.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you changed his mind.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well, you
certainly influenced him,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's very controversial.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:84%
You are now getting into
somebody else's mind.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.496 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it unethical?

00:37:25.496 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT:
Exactly, that's why

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I liked the example I
showed you of telepathy.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:90%
You're doing telepathy.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You're reading your
own mind in the future,

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and you're influencing it.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this idea of
influencing-- the transcript

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that gets generated
at remote viewing time

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:84%
was influenced by
you in your future.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So your own future
is influencing you,

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and you can do that
in lots of ways.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I prefer, because I like to
avoid the ethics question--

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe I shouldn't-- see
how it works on yourself.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:90%
You can do health the same way.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:84%
You can let your future
healthy self influence you

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:84%
in the present to
make good choices.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.174 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of remote
influencing others,

00:38:11.174 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
getting into
somebody else's mind,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:90%
that's what scares our society.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
remote viewers today

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:90%
are looking into the future?

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And if they are, what
are they seeing for us?

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well,
Joe McMoneagle

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book on that, and he
ultimately sees a good future.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We make it through
some tough times,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
so it turns out to be
an optimistic view.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:42.475 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:84%
See, I would think that we're
going to have a bumpy road.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.886 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And he
talks about a bumpy road,

00:38:48.886 --> 00:38:50.545 align:middle line:84%
and that's sort of
what I see, too.

00:38:50.545 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you one
of the reasons I'm

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:90%
optimistic about the future.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I like the
fact that you are.

00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: The future
can affect the past.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:84%
The future is
affecting the present.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.650 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:84%
The future is going to
have a lot more wisdom.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have a
lot more knowledge,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:84%
based on all the experiences
that we're doing now.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's learning from all the
crap that's going on now, OK,

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:90%
but we're still here.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process,
but we are learning

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.520 align:middle line:90%
from a wiser, existing future.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like a path, and I don't
think we would be here now.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:50.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, the fact is, as bad as
it looks, many of us at least--

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
most, but certainly

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
most in the United
States-- are doing fine.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We're living
reasonable, happy lives.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure, those who
are working, you know.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:07.432 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well, as I say,
there are most, but guess what.

00:40:07.432 --> 00:40:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The reality, the
wisdom that they

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:84%
have is being connected
to the wisdom which

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:90%
is coming from the future.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you look back, and
technologically things

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.990 align:middle line:84%
are going ahead at a
remarkable pace, right?

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes too fast.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.675 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well, what
do we mean by too fast?

00:40:33.675 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's
what we don't know.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm claiming--

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, remember the old
saying, life was simpler then?

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: It was, and
some would say better.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But notice we cannot
change change.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Change is happening,
and the acceleration

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
in the technological
field, I believe,

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is because the technological
future is passing

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.119 align:middle line:90%
on information to us now.

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's driving us.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.368 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: But guess what.

00:41:02.368 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:84%
That means there is that
technological future out there,

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
which is connected
to a larger society

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and a successful,
larger society.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you believe our
future, through remote viewing,

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.772 align:middle line:90%
shows a pretty good picture?

00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Yes, with
this idea of consciousness

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:84%
being fundamental and the
sharing of information

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.640 align:middle line:84%
from the future with
the present says,

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.220 align:middle line:90%
we're going to make it nicely.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope so, Marty.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you training people
now in remote viewing?

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Yes, we have an
organization called the Applied

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Precognition Project,
and that's what we do.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We are applying remote
viewing, with the focus

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:90%
on applying precognition.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have our conferences
once a year in Las Vegas.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
to a few of those.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Well,
they're actually

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.150 align:middle line:90%
separate from the IRVA.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the International
Remote Viewing one.

00:41:59.275 --> 00:42:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Correct, and
we train people, though,

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.554 align:middle line:90%
We have about 15 groups now.

00:42:07.554 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.654 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Each which
have, like, 5 to 15 people.

00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen some
great students come out of it?

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.486 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: Oh,
it's remarkable,

00:42:14.486 --> 00:42:18.275 align:middle line:84%
and we see students get
better all the time.

00:42:18.275 --> 00:42:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really
exciting to be doing this,

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and we want to extend it to
as many people as we can.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they find you?

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: They find
us on appliedprecog.com,

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:90%
so they can go to our website.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the best way to find us.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:90%
And they are very active.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
anybody can do this?

00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENBLATT: Anybody can do it.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We train them, and
we get them involved

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
in sports groups,
financial groups,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.839 align:middle line:90%
really doing predictions.

00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: They get
their feedback, which

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.210 align:middle line:90%
is the best way you learn.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.047 align:middle line:84%
Even when you get misses, you
describe the wrong picture,

00:42:58.047 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:90%
you learn something.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.796 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:42:59.796 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENBLATT: And
it deepens you.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing from this

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
turns out not to be
the financial part.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
most demonstrable one,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.710 align:middle line:84%
but you learn about
your own subconscious.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.110 align:middle line:84%
You learn how to connect up with
this really, really deep part

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.910 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You learn
about yourself.

remote viewing, having ability
