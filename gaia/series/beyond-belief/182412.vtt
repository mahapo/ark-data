>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great guest for you
on this edition of the program.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
Lee Harris with us.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
He's an intuitive and
channeller who teaches people

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:10%
how to harness the
energetics of emotions,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:10%
and they integrate spirituality
into their own daily life.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Lee, welcome to the program.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE HARRIS: Great to be here.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm looking
forward to this.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.903 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great
ability you have.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of an empath at
the same time, aren't you?

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:10%
And like many empaths,
I didn't really

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:10%
understand that
when I was a kid.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:10%
But as I got older and
went through my own journey

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:10%
of healing, I realized that was
something that I had going on.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And now I really love
helping other people

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:10%
with that side of themselves.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
that kick in for you?

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
At what point in your life-- was
there something that happened

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and you went, oh my gosh,
I have this ability.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I started doing readings for
friends almost as a joke.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
A friend gave me a
tarot deck, and I

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
loved going for tarot
readings in my teens.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I used to feel very alive
when I would go for them.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so something metaphysical
was already activating in me.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But I would do these
readings for friends.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.405 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about the cards,

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:38.992 align:middle line:84%
so I would throw some
cards down and give them

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
information about their life.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.242 align:middle line:84%
And they would always say,
how did you know that.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really believe
it for a few years,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
but when I started
channeling and hearing

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.868 align:middle line:84%
the voice of my
guides, that was when

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
it went to a whole other level.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started to believe that
not only was I intuitive,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
but that if it was happening
to me, surely all of us

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
are intuitive.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
how it kicked off.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly
what is an empath?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So empaths
are people who

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
have a high level of
feeling or connection

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:90%
with the feelings of others.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So for example, as an empath,
you might walk into the room

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and immediately feel, wow,
there's a lot of anger going on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:90%
in this room.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
You might ask people-- yeah.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.253 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, how are you
today, and they go, I'm fine.

00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
you one thing,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
but you can clearly
feel in your own body

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
or you can sense what's going
on in the emotion of the room.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So all of us are
empathic to some degree,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
but people who
identify as empaths

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
are people who have a high
level of feeling and connection

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:90%
with the feelings of others.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they generally
care more for other people?

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes and no.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean it can go both ways
because we're all humans.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have our days
where we're more

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
able to care and other
days where that might

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:90%
be more challenging for us.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But generally, empaths have
a kind of mission in life

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:90%
to help alleviate suffering.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So some empaths will do that
by trying to help animals,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
some empaths will do that
by trying to help people.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And you find a lot
of empaths end up

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
being healers or
caring professions

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because they want to help
raise the energy of a person

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:84%
or a place or a room,
and they struggle

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
often when the energies conflict
or if it's darker or heavier.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things the empath has

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:90%
to figure out about themselves.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.173 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make you
feel better to be an empath?

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It used to
make me feel awful.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
So in my teens--

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, in my teenage
years, I hadn't figured it out,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and so I would be overwhelmed,
I would be overloaded.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was turned
it on myself, and then

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in later years, I managed
to figure out that I was OK

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and that I could
be OK and started

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to seek healing
workshops, teachings that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
helped me connect with spirit.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And once I reconnected with
spirit, being an empath

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:90%
felt good.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess what you're asking too
though is maybe does helping

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:90%
someone make empaths feel good.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And generally, yes.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think there comes a
point when hopefully you

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
learn to balance that because
I think some people get

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
into doing it to compensate.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.967 align:middle line:84%
You'll often meet the
healer who is only

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
trying to heal other
people and isn't really

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:90%
looking at their own stuff.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I think there comes a beautiful
melting point when you're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
as aware of your own
shadow as your own light,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
but you recognize that
perhaps your purpose in life

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
is to when and where you
can help bring the light.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And on the areas where
you can't do that,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.522 align:middle line:84%
you're in self
care, maintenance.

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lee, the
film "Sensitive,"

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
which is available on Gaia,
deals with the subject

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:90%
of highly sensitive people.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:10%
- Findings also show that
highly sensitive people

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:10%
show greater activation
in areas that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:10%
are associated with empathy.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:10%
So in at least 20 or
30 studies of empathy,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:10%
people showed activation
in certain areas

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:10%
that highly sensitive
people are also

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:10%
engaging to a greater degree
in response to their partners

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:10%
and to strangers' emotions.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:10%
- When I walk into a room, I
know what everyone is feeling.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:10%
I know if someone's
had a bad day.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:10%
I know someone's
arguing with their wife.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:10%
It can be overwhelming.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:10%
And at a period of time, I
couldn't leave my house at all,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:10%
when I lived in Los Angeles,
because I'd walk out my door

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:10%
and feel the feelings
of 8 million people.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:10%
And so I'd run
back into my house.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:10%
But I really, really
love that I notice things

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:10%
that other people don't notice.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:10%
It helps me be an
antenna for the world.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.142 align:middle line:10%
Through my writing, I
know what's going on

00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:10%
and what people need to hear
and then I can write about it.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:10%
So I've turned it sort of
from a curse and a bad trait

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:10%
into something that is helpful
to myself and to others.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh,
Lee, how would you

00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:57.965 align:middle line:84%
like to feel the feelings of
8 million people at one time?

00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's beautiful.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
That's so perfect.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that happen
to you like that too?

00:06:01.908 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There were
times in my life

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
where I definitely didn't
want to leave the house,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'm happy to say that now
because I'm in a place where

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I've figured out the
balance points that I need,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier for me to know
how to balance the sensitivity

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and have it be more of
a gift than a curse.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think any
sensitive or empath

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
watching that clip will
completely identify.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you train
somebody to be an empath

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.435 align:middle line:90%
or to be sensitive?

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I believe--

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do you
have to have it?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I think like anything, there
are innate gifts and talents

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that we each come in with
and we are wired in that way.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody can learn
to become more empathic, more

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
aware, more emotionally attuned,
Just as empaths and sensitives

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
can learn to not be held
hostage to the emotional field

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
outside them by figuring out
who they are and what they need

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and developing
their own core too.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think often for
empaths and sensitives,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
they have to go the other way.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
They have to figure out how to
draw back, how to be in this.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But for sure I've
seen many people

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
go through huge transformations
and become more empathic, more

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:90%
sensitive, more aware.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you're an empath?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.787 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I am now.

00:07:15.787 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cause it
sounds like it could

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
be a curse and a blessing.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I am now, but I've had those
dark night of the soul moments

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:84%
where you feel lost and you
don't know how to function.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why me, God, right?

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I think-- yeah.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I ever
really understood--

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
why me, God is
definitely something

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.522 align:middle line:90%
that I was saying at the time.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
if I really put it

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
down to the understanding
of my function at the time.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I think I was probably just in
full on victim mode and feeling

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
sorry for myself that I
was kind of in the hole.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But no, I am ahead now
especially when I realize

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that whatever strength I've
managed to garner so far

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
has put me in a position that I
can help other people because I

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
know what it's like when you're
struggling or suffering with it

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's disabling your life.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you lost this
ability to be empathic,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:90%
would you feel lost right now?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, that's
such a good question.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I'd know--

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'd know how to
navigate the world because much

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
as we just saw in that clip,
part of my navigation system--

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's part
of your life now.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it's
become so ingrained,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and I've learned to
use it that, yeah.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't I don't
know who I would be.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
It would be fascinating.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you tell if--

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
let's say you went into a
classroom of six-year-olds

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
which ones will become empathic
and which ones will not?

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.997 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell that?

00:08:41.997 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: You can feel it.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.497 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
feel it with kids.

00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it with adults.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I can spot the sensitive
person in a room of 30 people

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
just by feeling, and so what
other sensitive people be

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.402 align:middle line:90%
able to do the same.

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
I think the sports fan

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
can spot the other
sports fan at a wedding

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
where they're not really
clicking with anyone else.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, definitely
you can feel it

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
because there is
something in the aura.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
There is something that you
can perceive in the aura,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the way
they're responding.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the way they are
noticing and responding

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:90%
to other people, stimuli.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what marks them out.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how they care.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've noticed that.

00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got six grandchildren,
and most of them, I would say,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
are empathic because they
care about other people,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
they question
things, and they seem

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to be more alert
about other things

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
too, their surroundings
and things like that.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system is a bit more
highly wired, but what you say

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
is a real truth, I
think, of our time.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that prophecy

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is spoken about that we are
becoming a more generally

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
sensitive and empathic
society, which

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I think is why there
is so much overt talk

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and teaching about this
phenomena at the moment,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because I think everyone in
society, especially the younger

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
generations, are coming in
more sensitive and more wired

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is an empath, like
yourself, psychic as well?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the ability
to perceive things?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
follow that way.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But for me, for example, I
heard the voice of my guides

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 22 and
have been a channeller.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I think,
like many people,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
there can be multiple gifts
that cross over in one person.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I've met some empaths who don't
talk about feeling psychic

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
at all or getting messages,
but their psychic energy

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
comes from being able
to tune in on what's

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:90%
going on in people around them.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's where their
intuition comes from,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a felt sense of
people and what's

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
going on, but not necessarily
psychic messages for them.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you thought of--

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the US presidents
over the last 20 some years.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Any of them empath?

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I would
say there's probably

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
a couple that definitely
had more sensitivity.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I think at the moment we're
seeing the opposite extreme,

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting, and
is certainly highlighting

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:90%
something to the world.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a teaching moment
for everyone in the world

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to see what behaviors and
actions are taken when there is

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.457 align:middle line:84%
no empathy in the person and
how dangerous and destructive

00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:90%
that can be for everybody.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And how wonderful it
could be if they are.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, Yeah.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just seems that
we need more leaders who are

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:90%
empathic about other people.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I think that one
of the things that my guides

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
have talked about a lot in
the channels over the years

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
is they say that the time
that we're in is as tough

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
or as brutal a
learning phase as it

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:90%
is a receiving of new energy.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So they say you're receiving
a lot of new energy,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
your world is becoming
more sensitive,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
there is a rise in heart energy.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But equally, all of the
dissonance, all of the ugly

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is really in your face,
not just because of

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:84%
how the heart energy is
rising, but because we

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
need to see it to learn
from it, to heal through it.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So for example, that public
figure, that public leader,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing is they're
pinging inside everyone's body

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that person's experience
of that leader.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, oh my god,
he reminds me of my boyfriend

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and that reminds me of how I
got treated by my boyfriend.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And so people are
having personal healings

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.917 align:middle line:84%
through these public
figures, and that's often

00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
why public figures can be very
important to the collective.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we elect the person

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn from next,
which can be cold comfort when

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:90%
you look at it.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
You're like, really?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's what my
guides often say.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
They say on a
spiritual level, you

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
will manifest the highs and
the lows in public focus,

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
just as you manifest
that in your life

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you learn
more about who you are

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and who you're here
to be and become that.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you perceive events
that haven't happened yet?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Sometimes.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes and in
quite specific ways.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not the
kind of psychic who

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
can give you
specific information

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.695 align:middle line:84%
about your grandmother's
favorite activity.

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
There are some
psychics out there

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
who have that kind of connection
to those kinds of facts.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But for me, what my skill seems
to be is to see someone's path.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So if I was doing a private
session with you, for example,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.002 align:middle line:84%
we would talk about where
you're at right now.

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you what
I was seeing in you

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and what was coming
up for you right now.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd be able to look
at the next year or two for you

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes 10 years
ahead and say, oh,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
George, one of your acts of
service in the next 10 years

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is to really bring community
together around paranormal

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and help normalize
some of those things

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and help people connect
to that themselves.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're helping people
become more intuitive

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.782 align:middle line:90%
because of what you're doing.

00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But in these next
two years, you're

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
going to have a very specific
arc in your teaching that's

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:90%
going to be about emotions.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.795 align:middle line:84%
And that's partly because
of what the collective want

00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:84%
from you, and it's partly
because of what you

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
are learning in your own life.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going through
your own heart awakening

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
at the next level,
so you're teaching

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.155 align:middle line:84%
and what you stand for
is going to offer that

00:14:21.155 --> 00:14:23.072 align:middle line:84%
to the collective in the
next couple of years.

is not forthright with you

when you're looking at them?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
What if what if they're
lying to you about things?

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it, and
I'm sure probably you

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and most of the viewers of
this show have the same thing.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
You can feel when
what someone's saying

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
is different to what they are
feeling inside their body.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
sensitive and the empath

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
can't ignore what's going on
in someone's energy field,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the ones that
just boggles your mind when

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.515 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
somebody empathically?

00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's interesting.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
powerful intuitive moments--

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have
been many, but this one

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:90%
comes back to mind.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a girl who
I was working with.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I was 19 years
old and I was just

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
playing with the
tarot cards, and she

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
had a really, really,
really awful experience

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of sexual abuse,
and she was someone

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I'd known for six months.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
about her history,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and we put the
cards down and just

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
the words came to me really
clearly about that she

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
was still plagued by
her past and the abuse

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that she'd gone through.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And she just burst into tears,
and then we worked through it

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
for the next 20 minutes or so.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was a key moment
for me where she was

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
like, how did you know that?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.783 align:middle line:84%
How could you give me
some of those details?

00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't feel it was me.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It was me tuning in
on her energy field.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
She'd given me
permission to because we

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
were doing a readings.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was open with you.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That was one
of the big moments.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just
the information,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:84%
it was the fact that then we
emotionally worked together

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
with it for 20 minutes because
she had a big eruption.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And then by the end of it, she'd
gone through a layer of it.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So for me, both on an intuitive
level and an empathic level,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the
big eye openers for me

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:90%
in my early years.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%

look at or do you

listen for their voice and
their inflections and things

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:90%
like that?

To me, it's so energetic.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling and it's a
response that I get in my body.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It might be that after
I have a feeling--

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, that person isn't
being authentic right now,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, I
might then go to the mind

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:90%
and analyze.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, the voice
wasn't very inhabited.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's actually a
physical intuitive response

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
happens first, and then
I interpret second.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The voice
though is important.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And I always think
that's the gift of video.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I think the gift
of video is people

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:90%
can't hide very well on video.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that's
the gift of this time with so

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
much going on video is
you can tell immediately

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
whether someone is the
right resonance for you

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
if you watch them
for 10, 20 seconds.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You can feel whether
that person is being

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:90%
authentically who they are.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps more importantly,
they're who you need.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%

see that in person.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%

And I think more
than anything, I

00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
do see it as a gift now
because of all the people

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that I've met who have
the ability and the gift.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And I do think it's important--

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
like all of us are
here to do something,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that those with the
gift of empathy and sensitivity,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
they have something really
important to do at this time.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's healing the
wounds from past generations

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
where sensitivity was
forbidden or emotional energy

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:90%
was not allowed.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of healing goes on.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel like
we're a bridge generation

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
for the next generation
who are coming in wired so

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:90%
empathically and emotionally.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way,
I think any of us

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that are using our gift in that
way, we're here for the past

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%

you use a lot of it

>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
do it consciously,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
but communicating to people has
never been a problem for me,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.360 align:middle line:90%
even if I'm with someone who--

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
a very different walk of life.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I think when you connect
to people through the heart

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
or through feeling, we can
all connect with each other,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%

The one thing that
doing this job

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
taught me, because I started
doing readings for people

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:84%
15 years ago, is that everybody,

no matter their perceived
success, no matter how happy

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
their life looks on
the outside, everybody

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
is either struggling
with something,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
growing through something,

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of dark night at the soul.

a great day or a tricky day.

with people from that place,

then you really
connect with people.

said, we're going to lose him.

He's going to go.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:90%

he's in Detroit.

like within an hour or so,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:90%
he had died.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%

I did my show, and a
lot of people felt--

who knew me, oh my god,
how can he do this?

How can he have the
strength to do this?

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But I got my strength
from being on the air.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.845 align:middle line:90%
That's what I needed.

00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I needed the
feedback from people.

And it was a different
kind, but that

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is how different people

as I was talking

with a previous guest on one
of our other "Beyond Belief"

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%

human mechanism that has this

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or if there's something outside
that gives us this ability.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I haven't figured that out yet.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a
combination of the both.

>>HARRIS: I believe it's

You know, I think--

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that blows my mind is

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.587 align:middle line:84%
when I see two people not
communicating and not realizing

00:23:16.587 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:90%
they're not communicating.

And you're watching them
just slam against each other,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's a part
of me, especially

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
if it's someone
I'm close to, that

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
has to stop myself from
interfering sometimes

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and go, no, no.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Let them figure this out.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I want
to get in the middle

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and bridge the conversation,
which is a typical empath

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:90%
trait as well.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I think
it's interesting

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
how communication and
connection are so intertwined.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that it's
not something we're taught.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:90%
We should be.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
We should be taught more about
communication and empathy

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
when we're children because,
as kids, we actually

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.543 align:middle line:90%
come in ready to be good at it.

00:23:53.543 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the way that
we're trained in our society

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
knocks all of that out of us.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So unless you then
feel passionately

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
about going back and figuring
it out, or like many of us,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
you're in a crisis if
you don't figure it out,

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.878 align:middle line:84%
then some people just
get lost and left

00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
in the middle place
where they're not

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.223 align:middle line:84%
really great at
communicating but they

00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:90%
haven't worked that out yet.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.425 align:middle line:90%

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:10%

How do you say to them, look,

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:10%
You're not-- how do you say
that to your boss, right?

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:10%

>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

>>SANGWAN: OK.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:10%
So there's a few steps here.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:10%
The first one is you have to
know what those signals are.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:10%
And it sounds like you
know what yours are.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:10%
Your body talks to you.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.258 align:middle line:10%
Your physiology talks to you.

00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:10%
I call it your
physical intelligence.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.718 align:middle line:10%
My stomach turns to stone.

00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:10%
>>SANGWAN: Right Well, that's
an uncomfortable feeling.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:10%
So most people will go
first and numb that out.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.847 align:middle line:10%
So excuse me.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:10%
What they'll do is they'll
go get a chocolate chip

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:10%
cookie and a latte, OK?

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:10%
So the first step is
actually tuning in.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:10%
And when you do, there's
a lot of ways to tune in.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:10%
Some people take deep breaths.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:10%
They manage themselves.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:10%
It's that discomfort
in someone's body

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:10%
that stops them from
speaking their truth.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:10%
But this is the secret--

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:10%
the secret is you come
to a decision point

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:10%
many times in your day, do
I tell the truth, do I not?

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:10%
Do I say what I really
mean, do I hold back?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:10%
The deal is that if you
feel that discomfort

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:10%
and you numb it, you're going to
get a short-term effect, which

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:10%
is your short-term high
of just avoiding it.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:10%
Like, ooh, got away with that.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:10%
Right.

I escaped the lion.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:10%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:10%
Oh, woo.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:10%
Thank god, I skipped
that conflict.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:10%
But long term, every time
you look in the mirror,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:10%
you're going to respect
yourself a little bit less.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:10%
Why didn't I have the courage
to stand up and say that?

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:10%
How come I didn't say what I
really meant in that meeting?

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:10%
How come I didn't tell them
that that wasn't OK, right?

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, the flip side of that-- as
you come to that decision point

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:10%
and you become aware of
the physical intelligence

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:10%
in your body and you
decide, you know what,

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to use my breathing.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to calm
myself, and I'm

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:10%
going to deal with the
short-term discomfort, not

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:10%
the short-term high of
avoiding it or numbing it.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:10%
You're going to take the
short-term discomfort

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:10%
and lean into that discomfort
for the long-term high

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:10%
of liking yourself, of
having great relationships,

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.082 align:middle line:10%
of investing in your life.

00:26:48.082 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think of that, Lee?

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.748 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It was great.

00:26:50.748 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Yep, so true.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They call her the
Doctor of Communication.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:90%
That's probably why.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I think also one
of the things that

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
has allowed me to really get
behind speaking my truth more

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in my life and helping
other people do

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:90%
it is it's a growth path.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think when you go through
those difficult conversations,

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:84%
you change how you will speak
about things in the future

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that short-term
moment with your boss.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it will relate back to
something in your childhood.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
There will be a time that
you were silenced or shamed

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for speaking that is
now in your stomach

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
when you're sat in
front of your boss.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, there are
many different things

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
you can do if you want to
tell your boss that they're

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
making you feel bad
or not feel worthy.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wouldn't be
good to go in there and go,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
you treat me really badly.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good bye!

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is talk
about what you're experiencing

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and what you're feeling and
communicate that to them.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think longer term, one
of the things that I believe,

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and this came through my guides
once is the power that we have

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:84%
with our words changes
the room, changes

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:90%
our life, changes the future.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into
a room and you just

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
tell the truth when no one
else is telling the truth,

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:84%
it's going to put a
crackle in the room.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if everyone else
is playing a safe game,

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.028 align:middle line:84%
everyone's going to be a little
uncomfortable for a moment.

00:28:14.028 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But what you're going
to do is completely

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
change the energy of what's
going on in that room.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we're afraid of.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.025 align:middle line:84%
We're afraid of the
power of our words.

00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:23.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it, Lee,
also how you tell the truth?

00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, there
are ways to say things

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and there are ways not to.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, there's the
famous phrase, "the praise

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.026 align:middle line:90%
sandwich."

00:28:33.026 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
If you have to give someone some
difficult feedback, and this

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
used to come up in
jobs that I was in.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, well, give
them a praise sandwich.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
If you need to
tell them that they

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.607 align:middle line:84%
need to stop
painting the box blue

00:28:44.607 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and they have to paint it
red, and they've been painting

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.648 align:middle line:84%
it blue all this time,
tell them how much

00:28:48.648 --> 00:28:49.745 align:middle line:90%
you love their painting.

00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then tell them they need
to change the color.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.537 align:middle line:84%
Then tell them what a
great employee they are.

00:28:53.537 --> 00:28:55.772 align:middle line:84%
So the praise sandwich
is kind of something

00:28:55.772 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that I remember
growing up hearing.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I think it's
important, because none of us

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:90%
want to be attacked or judged.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that to
someone, it immediately--

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:90%
think of yourself.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.938 align:middle line:90%
It puts us on the defensive.

00:29:06.938 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you just
say, hey, I just

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
want to talk to you
about something.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.877 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're great, and
we have a great relationship.

00:29:12.877 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's something that
keeps coming up for me,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to tell
you what's going on.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.572 align:middle line:84%
It's a much safer way to open
a conversation with someone,

00:29:20.572 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
think that person might

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:90%
be combative or defensive.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But like was said
in the video clip,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
you have to speak your truth,
because if you keep swallowing

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:90%
it, it turns on you eventually.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
love fit into this, Lee?

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean love in
terms of relationships.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But just in love of life
and your fellow man.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.178 align:middle line:90%
Where does that fit into it?

00:29:42.178 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I've
always thought of love

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:84%
as flow and connection, that
place where everything feels

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:90%
open and possible and flowing.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's kind
of what defines love.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're having a lovely
meal with a few friends,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and it just feels good.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:84%
No one's second-guessing
what's going to be said.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:90%
You feel relaxed.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You feel open.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Complimentary
to other people.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And you feel--
yeah, there's like a harmony.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I feel that our job,
certainly speaking for myself,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to cultivate
that state in myself more

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to share
and generate it with others

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:90%
as I learn.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's probably
going to be my life's path.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you consider
that higher harmonics?

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do, yes.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And funnily enough,
there was a channel

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that I just created
called "Light Years."

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was 2019 to
2022, and the subtitle

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
was "The Era of
Higher Harmonics."

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And my guides were saying
that's the era that we're

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.740 align:middle line:84%
in now, where people who are
sensitive, spiritually awake,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
higher harmonics is going to be
what we create, what we seek,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and what we bring to our lives.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And if things are dissonant,
if things aren't working,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see those
things disappear or blow up

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot faster, because
the era that we're in now

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is one of higher
harmonics for people

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:90%
who are walking that path.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you just
mentioned your videos,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:90%
under "Energy Updates."

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If you are
trying to give love

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who is not
receiving that love

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't want that
love, the problem

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:27.462 align:middle line:84%
is resentment or exhaustion
or rejection can build in you.

00:31:27.462 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why, in this
time of high harmonics,

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you need to know who you
are and what you need

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and to constantly check, is
this aligned with where I am

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and who I am with?

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And if it isn't, I can
trust that there is

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:10%
a higher path available for me.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.770 align:middle line:10%
We do understand that the
wounds of human relationship

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:10%
will keep you bound
to each other in ways

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:10%
that are not often healthy.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
this feels like.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It is when things
feel a little dead,

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:10%
a little at half-mast,
a little like you

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:10%
are going through the motions.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:84%
An experience of
high harmonics is

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:84%
when you feel alive,
when you feel present,

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:90%
when you no longer notice time.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:10%
And here is the big key--

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:10%
where you no longer have to
check if things are aligned,

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:10%
for you are flowing together.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Shall we say, you and those
you are in relationship with

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
are rowing the boat
in the same direction.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:10%
So there is a flow and a journey
that you experience together

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:10%
that all of you get to
benefit from, rather

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:10%
than a frustration that
things are going either round

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:10%
and round in circles or
progress is being halted

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:10%
for all because there are
different minds at work

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:10%
within your partnership,
within your group,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:10%
or within your experience
of where you are living,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:10%
for the same can be true of
your relationship to a place.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well done, Lee.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.300 align:middle line:84%
That was a channeled
message actually,

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:90%
a channeled audio message.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, yeah,
that's channeling.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wanted to give you
full credit all by yourself.

00:33:13.597 --> 00:33:15.185 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, I can't take it.

00:33:15.185 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is something.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But no, some of those
points that you mentioned

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.040 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely true.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
we tried to get

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
through to somebody in
a caring, loving way,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and it just doesn't work?

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It makes us feel
worse, doesn't it?

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it doesn't
help the dynamic.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.235 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting because
it's a one-hour message.

00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:36.005 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things they
talk about that's leaving

00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:90%
is the old karmic ties.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So again, I feel
like my messages

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
are designed for
the group of people

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.857 align:middle line:84%
who are sensitive, empathic,
awake spiritually on that path.

00:33:46.857 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
they were saying

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:84%
was the era of old karmic ties
is just done for that group.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And anytime that you're trying
to compromise or fix or heal

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
something that is
too heavy for you,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:84%
it's going to really
hit you in the face now,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
which is actually a gift.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's time for
people to experience

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:90%
a lighter state of being.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
However, as we know, that
takes time to get used to.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're used to being in
an abusive relationship,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
it takes time to recover
from that relationship

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and start to allow in and trust
people who are kind to you.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you bring
up something interesting.

00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that some people who
are in abusive relationships

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.960 align:middle line:84%
continue to be in
abusive relationships,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.420 align:middle line:90%
even if they find other people?

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean, it's
a couple of things.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I think happens

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:84%
most is that you
will find people

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.489 align:middle line:84%
who are in those kinds of
relationships, it comes slowly.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you are
attracted to somebody who

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:90%
is immediately abusive to you.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
It's that probably
love is how it started.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And then as those two
people betrothed themselves

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to each other,
commit to each other,

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:90%
the behavior starts to change.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think this happens
to a lot of people.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
That perhaps the
abusive partner just

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
manages to tap on your
wound of low self-esteem

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
in just the right way
at just the right time.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And so that activates.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
actually get stuck in

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
is your own wound of
self-esteem that you're

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
playing out with this person.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's difficult
to put a kind of "one size

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:84%
fits all" diagnosis on
that, because every single

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:90%
relationship is so specific.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But generally it's that
we're playing out a wound

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and becoming the victim from
inside ourselves in mirror

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to the person who is
playing out behavior.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does somebody
pull themself away from that

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.665 align:middle line:90%
and get away from it?

00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
hopefully, what happens

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is it either gets so bad
that the person hits a rock

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:84%
bottom in the relationship
and has to get out

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
or that other people around
them are enough of a frequency

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
difference that they start
to go, hang on a second.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:84%
When I go and visit my
friend, she's loving to me.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I go back
to my partner,

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're just abusive.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So with people I've worked
with who have had that,

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and I had a few rough
relationships myself as well in

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
my early 20s, and
I think it takes

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that wake-up call of
what's OK, treatment

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:90%
of yourself from someone else.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But then you really have
to look at yourself.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what part
of my low self-esteem

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:90%
thought that that was OK?

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.803 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you do the
repair work on yourself when

00:36:22.803 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:84%
you get out of a
relationship like that,

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:84%
you start to go, what was
this trying to teach me?

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.055 align:middle line:84%
So that I don't
walk into it again.

00:36:29.055 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.073 align:middle line:84%
Now, you do videos
and online courses.

00:36:32.073 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:90%
How are they received?

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And how do people do this?

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, good.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So I do a monthly energy
update every month.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.620 align:middle line:90%
One of the things I saw--

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what we saw?

00:36:40.703 --> 00:36:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so this was a
short clip from the end of one,

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:90%
which was the channeled audio.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
The monthly energy
updates that I do,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:90%
it's just me direct to camera.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I talk for about 12
minutes and give my take

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
on what patterns of energy
are showing up in the month

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're on YouTube
and at my website.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I do online courses
on a range of topics.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I mean, I really love
serving the community online

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:90%
who resonate with my work.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And my passion, because I
was a channeler early on,

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
was to try and also work on the
middle part of what channeling

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
does to you.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Channeling raises
your frequency,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:90%
but it also reveals the blocks.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So I really like working on
a grounded spiritual level

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with people on what comes up
when you're on a growth path?

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
reorganize yourself?

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.518 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
kind of-- that's

00:37:32.518 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the range my work goes between.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you've had
some great success stories.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.345 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
it's always pleasing

00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:84%
when you're the right
medicine for someone

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:90%
else in their journey.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, watching someone-- some
of the most heartening ones,

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people go from
tough relationships,

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.747 align:middle line:84%
intimate relationships, and
then a couple of years later,

00:37:53.747 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:84%
they meet someone who's
the right person for them,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
because we looked at the
underlying stuff for them

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to get them to a place
where they realized

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:90%
they deserved that love.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But equally, I love working
with people on their work,

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.660 align:middle line:84%
whether they're a creative
or a business person.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer in the
path of our work has purpose.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So I really love helping
people to take their work

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.107 align:middle line:90%
to the next level too.

00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lee, what
would you say would

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:84%
be the most satisfying
thing you've

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.865 align:middle line:84%
done in your career, that
personally just hit you?

00:38:26.865 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The first
thing that comes to mind,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I learn
when I go out and do

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:90%
live events around the world.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's when someone, and I've
had this happen a lot, someone

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:90%
I've just met that minute.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'll hold my
hand, or they'll hug me,

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and they will look me in
the eye and from the pit

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
of their stomach, they will
go, your energy updates got me

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:84%
through the worst year of my
life, or your audio recordings.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And I know that--

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't
know who they are?

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't
know who they are.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I've never met them before.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the beauty
of the work that any of us

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
do in the world, whether
like us, you're broadcasting,

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're the
person in a hospital who

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.073 align:middle line:84%
meets people at the reception
desk who are in trauma

00:39:11.073 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and just the way you
smile at them and the way

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're friendly to
them just resets their day.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the beauty
of us not knowing

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that there are ripple effects
of what we do in the world

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.870 align:middle line:90%
and who we are every single day.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.963 align:middle line:84%
That always kind of
blows my heart open.

00:39:27.963 --> 00:39:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.040 align:middle line:84%
When I was coming here from Los
Angeles, we went through TSA.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who is looking at
your boarding pass and your ID,

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.440 align:middle line:84%
he looks up at me, and
goes, I love your show.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.370 align:middle line:90%
You've made a difference for me.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.327 align:middle line:84%
You make my ride
going home great.

00:39:44.327 --> 00:39:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Fantastic.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as
I'm going through,

00:39:46.577 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you
get your check yet?

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because of the former
government shutdown.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, we're
starting to get paid now.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And I thumbs-upped him.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.595 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:39:56.595 --> 00:40:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a good feeling to
know you've touched someone

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and it worked, whatever it is.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's the
same for a parent.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Because like any work
that anybody does,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
there can be highs and lows.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.680 align:middle line:90%
There can be challenges.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like the parent, who after
four days of being exhausted

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
with their kid, the child turns
round and goes, "I love you."

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And they just melt.
And it's like, oh, OK.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we all
need those moments.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As opposed
to, "I hate you."

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Or I won't tie my shoes.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.565 align:middle line:84%
I think we all need those
moments of recognition

00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that what we're
doing, who we are here

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing
here is connecting.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I think really that's
what it's all about.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, we're
connecting with each other.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of being empathic

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
is based on how you
were raised as a child?

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's a good question.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I think two truths
about that for me.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I have really, my
parents are very kind.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like that was--

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mine are and were.

00:40:56.045 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:90%
My mother's still with us.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.463 align:middle line:84%
But they were as good as parents
I could ever imagine to be.

00:41:01.463 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I
mean, my parents

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:84%
were extraordinary
to us as kids.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And the older I've
got, the more I

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
realized that, that they really
did just do what they could

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:90%
for us as kids.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So I come from a kind of loving
and kind and warm family.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It shows
with who you are.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel like that
was the greatest gift

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.620 align:middle line:90%
that the family gave me.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
another side of my empathy

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that, although I say it
doesn't exist in my family,

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I think it does.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.035 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
been interesting

00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that as I've done the
work that I've done,

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:84%
my mom has started to talk a bit
more about her intuition, which

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:84%
she never thought
she could talk about.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And I see it with my
brother and sister, too.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So I do think sensitivity
and empathy is something

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that, if nurtured, if you have
examples of it around you,

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:90%
it helps you become it more.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, it's
even more of a challenge.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.763 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, There's
no question about it.

00:41:52.763 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Because every time you read
case studies of, let's say,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:84%
serial killers, they
were abused as children.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Something horrible
happened to them.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody did
something bad to them.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And look what happened
to their psyche.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:84%
As they get older,
they lash out.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.730 align:middle line:84%
They're probably trying to
hurt the person who hurt them

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.240 align:middle line:90%
through these other people.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Which is why, to me,
the more I've done this work

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and the more I
understood it, the more I

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:84%
understood the
purpose of healing

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.570 align:middle line:90%
is so vital for humanity.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like all of us need to
heal those wounds, those layers,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
example you just

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:90%
gave being the most extreme.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we can all overcome or
move through the things that

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:84%
jarred us, dented
us, wounded us,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:84%
then we do become more
compassionate, more loving,

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and better for society.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And if more of us become
that way, then the society

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.290 align:middle line:84%
itself is going to look
and read very differently.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear rumors
you have a new book out.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.297 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do, yes.

00:42:51.297 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it called?

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.922 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's called
Energy Speaks--

00:42:53.922 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Messages From Spirit on
Living, Loving, and Awakening."

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
what it's all about.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
all of these years,

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I've done so many
different channels

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:90%
on so many different topics.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.525 align:middle line:84%
So the book is
bringing together some

00:43:06.525 --> 00:43:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of greatest
hits of the channels.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are chapters
on abundance and money,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.107 align:middle line:84%
chapters on sex
and sexual energy,

00:43:14.107 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:90%
chapters on relationships.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What chapter is that?

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.238 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
that's actually one

00:43:18.238 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:84%
of the most popular things
I've ever done, actually,

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.385 align:middle line:90%
and It's interesting.

00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all interested
in sexual energy because A,

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:90%
it's taboo.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.297 align:middle line:84%
But B, one of the things
that I'm really clear about

00:43:29.297 --> 00:43:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is our sexual energy,
if you think about it,

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.330 align:middle line:90%
it's a life force energy.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It's how we make other
people if we procreate.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So I've always seen it as
a really creative energy

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and a life force in us.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are
many different topics.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the opening chapter
is all about my story

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and how I came to be a channeler
and what I went through.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Foreword is by
Gaia's own Regina Meredith.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she does a
great job for us.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.028 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: She really does, yeah.

00:43:58.028 --> 00:44:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've been on
her show a number of times.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, she's great.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A number of times.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:84%
First time on "Beyond
Belief, by the way.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're reaching
a different audience

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that is all part of this.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about your channeling
ability and how you do that.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I was on
the London Underground which

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.880 align:middle line:84%
is a tube train, going to my
job in fundraising at the time.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just was sorting through
all the thoughts in my head.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I just
heard my guides.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was crystal clear.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And the position was kind
of here, kind of about here.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like hearing a voice
that originates here.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's still like
that to this day.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So I can have a conversation
with them, myself,

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and just hear the answers or
type or write the answers.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can also bring
them through my body,

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.440 align:middle line:84%
like you heard on the clip
that we played earlier.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
That was me just opening to
a one-hour message from them.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it was kind of--

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.502 align:middle line:84%
what blew my mind,
and this is what

00:44:55.502 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I tell people about
becoming a channeler,

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:90%
is I wasn't looking for it.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.152 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I
should be allowed

00:45:02.152 --> 00:45:04.610 align:middle line:84%
or able to do it, because I
always thought it was something

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.060 align:middle line:90%
much more special.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I always say, well, if I
could do it, anybody can do it

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so at my
workshops to this day,

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I will get people to
sit down, pen and paper,

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, write a message
from your higher self,

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.540 align:middle line:84%
your guides, Jesus,
whoever it is that you

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.700 align:middle line:90%
think is your higher power.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.915 align:middle line:90%
It's not about who it is.

00:45:23.915 --> 00:45:25.790 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to
bring something through.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's always my favorite
moment when I give them

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.320 align:middle line:84%
five minutes, and then I
hand the mic round and say,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:90%
how was that?

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.245 align:middle line:90%
And people are, oh, my god.

00:45:33.245 --> 00:45:34.933 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think I'd be able to.

00:45:34.933 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they did.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They did.

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And the value and the
wisdom and the energy

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that we get from
here or around us

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:84%
is phenomenal in how it
really opens and expands

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.470 align:middle line:90%
who we are internally.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul Selig
is a channeler

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and was on one of our
"Beyond Belief" episodes.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL SELIG: I'm a
clairaudient and channeling

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:10%
is the way the
clairaudience works with me.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:10%
I opened up psychically
when I was in my mid-20s,

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:10%
or I began to open up.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't believe
in any of this stuff,

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.880 align:middle line:10%
really, before it
started to happen.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And I studied a form
of energy healing

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:10%
when I was in my early 30s.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.510 align:middle line:10%
And I found that when I
had my hands on people,

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.883 align:middle line:10%
I could hear things for them.

00:46:15.883 --> 00:46:17.300 align:middle line:10%
So if I had my
hand on your chest,

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.760 align:middle line:10%
and I heard the name "Mark,"
I learned to say who's Mark?

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And you'd say, oh, that's my
brother, my father, my son.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:10%
And as people began to
validate the information,

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I began to trust
what was coming more,

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and the channel began to open.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.470 align:middle line:10%
So I say that I'm like a radio.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.830 align:middle line:10%
And when I'm channeling,
I'm attuned to a broadcast

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.650 align:middle line:10%
from a higher level, and my
guides are coming through.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.890 align:middle line:10%
If I'm tuned into you, you're
the station that I'm playing,

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and I'm hearing you
telepathically or the people

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.000 align:middle line:10%
that you ask about.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do you
tune into someone?

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:49.627 align:middle line:10%
>>SELIG: By intention.

00:46:49.627 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:10%
You know, I use the full name.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.070 align:middle line:10%
I like the full name.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.410 align:middle line:10%
That works for me, because
there's a real resonance to it.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if
Jane Smith comes to me,

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:10%
and I tune into Jane
Smith through the name,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.380 align:middle line:10%
I get all of Jane Smith.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.500 align:middle line:10%
If Jane Smith was married
to a guy named Clark, where

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.870 align:middle line:10%
she was traumatized and
she dropped the name Clark,

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:10%
a whole piece of her actually
will come through to me

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.780 align:middle line:10%
through Jane Clark Smith.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.570 align:middle line:10%
So I use the whole name
because different parts of us

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:22.180 align:middle line:10%
develop and sort of have
experiences at different times

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.270 align:middle line:10%
that I can tune into.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.030 align:middle line:10%
But it's not a lot
different than, say,

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:10%
a psychic who would hold your
watch and get the vibration.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm just using the name
as what I step into.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.470 align:middle line:10%
But I'm actually stepping
into you when I'm reading.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.270 align:middle line:10%
So I sort of become you.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.505 align:middle line:10%
It's not like I'm just
sort of tuning into you

00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:10%
and seeing what I can hear.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.710 align:middle line:10%
I actually, first, become you.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.408 align:middle line:10%
And then as you, I
feel what's going on,

00:47:44.408 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:10%
or you're going to tell
me what's going on.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:10%
And then when you ask about
people, I step into them.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.100 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, I start
to resemble them.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's kind of like
being a human switchboard.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.633 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
to look at what I do.

00:47:55.633 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I've
interviewed him, Lee,

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:02.650 align:middle line:84%
he will get into this channeling
mode and become that person.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk to
him, he's answering me

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.110 align:middle line:90%
as that other person.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.905 align:middle line:84%
And it's really strange
watching him perform like that.

00:48:09.905 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's great,
though, isn't it?

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love what Paul
said about human switchboard.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
used to say, when

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to do written readings
back at the very beginning

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.240 align:middle line:84%
before I went verbal, I would
have questions from people.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I always-- people
would say, well, what's it

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
like when you are answering
people's questions.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, it's
kind of like being

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
secretary to the universe.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You're just taking
down the information.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with
the verbal information.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I also love what Paul
said, because I'm

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.820 align:middle line:84%
sure this is true for
many channelers, too--

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was a time
when I would take people's hand

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and get information.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there
are many different gateways

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to somebody's auric
field and path.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.840 align:middle line:90%
So no, that was great.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the
Z's in your life?

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So when I
first heard my guides,

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I asked them quite
quickly, quite early on,

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you have a name?

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.997 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, well,
we don't have names.

00:49:01.997 --> 00:49:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
humans need names,

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:90%
so we'll give you the names.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You could call me Zachary,
and I'm the lead spokesperson

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.050 align:middle line:90%
of your guides.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:middle line:84%
We are 88 entities that then
extend wider into source.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years later, I
met Zaphariah and Ziadora, who

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:90%
identified as feminine energy.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years
after that, they said,

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're no longer doing
the split thing where we have

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.650 align:middle line:90%
a male voice and female voices.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We're just becoming
a collective again.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So now, I call them the Z's,
because it was three Z names.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.010 align:middle line:90%
They are a group.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Z's is actually what
people who followed my work

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.580 align:middle line:84%
started calling them,
so I just ran with it.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they find
you or how did you find them?

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
apparently, I had not

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.853 align:middle line:90%
heard them for 16 years.

00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:50.020 align:middle line:90%
They said we've been trying.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.710 align:middle line:90%
We've been talking to you 16--

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:90%
since you were little.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But I did have this
recurring dream,

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was the only recurring
dream I ever remember

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.490 align:middle line:90%
having when I was a kid.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I would be downstairs in
the living room of the house

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that we were living
in at the time.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was about five or six
when I used to have this dream.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And all I could hear
was static noise,

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.917 align:middle line:84%
like the old television
set, when you'd just hear

00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:13.125 align:middle line:90%
that [IMITATING WHITE NOISE].

00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The noise.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And in either
corner of the room,

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:84%
there was a male figure
and a female figure.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the female
figure had very big hair, almost

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.510 align:middle line:84%
like a big, blond Afro,
but it wasn't an Afro.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And they were both doing this.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.330 align:middle line:90%
They were saying something.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To you?

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And all I
remember was the frustration

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.090 align:middle line:84%
in the dream of all I could hear
was [IMITATING WHITE NOISE]..

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was the other
side of the room,

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.983 align:middle line:84%
and I was just listening
to the two of them.

00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:37.970 align:middle line:90%
So I asked them.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, years later, I connected
the dots, and went, oh,

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:90%
was that you.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, yeah.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:46.092 align:middle line:84%
So they were always there,
but it took me until 22

00:50:46.092 --> 00:50:47.240 align:middle line:90%
to really hear them.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was playing with
intuition for a few years that

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.800 align:middle line:90%
really opened the door.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mythologist
William Henry

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.640 align:middle line:90%
talks a lot about light workers.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You mention light workers
in "Energy Speaks" as well.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:01.130 align:middle line:90%
What are light workers?

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, to
me, a light worker

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is that person who drives
the Uber for you that day,

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.430 align:middle line:90%
who just lights up your day.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: My first
book, by the way,

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:09.785 align:middle line:10%
was called "Worker
in the Light."

00:51:09.785 --> 00:51:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Ah, great,
great, great, great.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so "light workers" is
a term that I learned through

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.800 align:middle line:90%
the Z's.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
I was familiar with.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
see it out there a lot.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So I realized, oh, this a thing.

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Light workers, by
nature, are people

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.240 align:middle line:84%
who are here to help raise
the vibration of the planet

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.570 align:middle line:90%
and that's their job.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would argue,
we're all doing that.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, the person who is the
chef, who is feeding people,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is playing their part.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But light workers are
usually specifically focused

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.120 align:middle line:84%
on vibration, frequency,
energy, consciousness, healing.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So they end up being
healers, artists,

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:48.410 align:middle line:84%
people who are doing things that
help lift people into a higher

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.400 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.025 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, like
every human being,

00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:84%
light workers are going through
their own growth journey,

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.460 align:middle line:84%
too, and going through
their own healing.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But the light workers who
identify as light workers

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.500 align:middle line:90%
tend to be focused in that way.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And their ability
to help other people

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.730 align:middle line:84%
could be tremendous
with what they do.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Huge.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:84%
They're often the leaders
around consciousness, emotion,

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.510 align:middle line:90%
non-conflict.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They are people who
can take those more

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.060 align:middle line:84%
dense or knotted or
conflicted emotions

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and help open them out
in a room or one-on-one

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.550 align:middle line:84%
or through a service
that they offer people.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have more
light workers than receivers,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.260 align:middle line:90%
basically?

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.128 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've
actually heard that--

00:52:29.128 --> 00:52:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I've actually heard that there
aren't that many light workers

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:32.550 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's not a lot, no.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that there
are several million.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.238 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of what the Z's--

00:52:36.238 --> 00:52:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that was the number they
put on it a while ago.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, I would argue--

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.547 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not a lot
with seven billion people.

00:52:41.547 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, not really.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But what they've
said is that everyone

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is a light worker at certain
moments of their day.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
I asked them, this

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
was about four or
five years ago,

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:55.130 align:middle line:84%
they said light workers
are energy movers.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said there are
several million on the planet,

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:90%
scattered across the planet.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But that what they're here to
do is to amplify light work.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So a light worker can
birth another light worker.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You can instill
values and energy

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.090 align:middle line:84%
by your way of being that
other people then run with.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So in theory, more
and more people

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.023 align:middle line:84%
are becoming light
workers all the time.

00:53:16.023 --> 00:53:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a good
thing for the planet.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, Yes.

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And also, because one
of the chronic issues

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.130 align:middle line:84%
for light workers is
usually loneliness.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like cosmic
loneliness, like the idea

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're on the
wrong planet or that they

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:30.380 align:middle line:90%
haven't found their tribe.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I see that be
one of the blocks

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to a light worker's feeling
of freedom and abundance

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and success in life.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And I don't mean success
like winning an award.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.510 align:middle line:10%
I just mean feeling like you
can be grateful for being alive.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Loneliness is a big wound for
a lot of light workers, yeah.

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you on YouTube?

00:53:49.215 --> 00:53:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I have a channel.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.500 align:middle line:10%
It's called Lee Harris Energy.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And my website is also
leeharrisenergy.com.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.985 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the
book, "Energy Speaks?"

00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:57.860 align:middle line:10%
How do they get that?

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.295 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: "Energy Speaks" is
on Amazon, all good outlets.

00:54:00.295 --> 00:54:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:01.690 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.440 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
people to take away

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.558 align:middle line:90%
from that book, "Energy Speaks?"

00:54:06.558 --> 00:54:07.850 align:middle line:90%
What do you want them to learn?

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: My hope
is that it really

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:13.670 align:middle line:84%
helps people open and
trust their own intuition,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:18.230 align:middle line:84%
their own higher self, and their
own feelings about the universe

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:22.100 align:middle line:84%
being far more magical and
mystical than most of us

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.560 align:middle line:84%
were ever trained to believe
it was when we were kids.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
truth of that power

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:90%
is what we need right now.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And once they do,
once they tap into this,

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.850 align:middle line:90%
what can they do?

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Where does it take them?

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, buckle
up, because it's usually

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.020 align:middle line:90%
quite a ride.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.353 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a roller coaster?

00:54:40.353 --> 00:54:41.228 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It depends.

00:54:41.228 --> 00:54:42.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It can be.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.553 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you've been
on a roller coaster before.

00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:45.678 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Certainly, I did.

00:54:45.678 --> 00:54:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't fall out, right?

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:84%
What I would say is
that for the people who

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.220 align:middle line:84%
go through a real opening
or a sudden awakening

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:57.100 align:middle line:84%
or a sudden realization that the
world is this intuitive place,

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.910 align:middle line:84%
be as measured as
you can about it.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Because like any high that
can be followed by a low.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think your opening
is going to settle down,

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.385 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
integrate in your life.

00:55:10.385 --> 00:55:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
a good thing.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But when it first settles
down, a lot of people

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:14.630 align:middle line:90%
are like, oh, my god.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:16.535 align:middle line:84%
I felt so alive
for so many months.

00:55:16.535 --> 00:55:17.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, that's good.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're getting used
to that level of aliveness,

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing it to a
merge of who you were before

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:24.930 align:middle line:90%
and who you are now.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of how the
growth path works.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you try to
reach people who are--

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say evil but just

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.550 align:middle line:90%
aren't in the right groove?

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't feel
like that's my thing.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, I really
admire the people who

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:47.405 align:middle line:84%
are built to kind of go there
with really tough people.

00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You try to
shy away from them.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: At this
stage of my life,

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel really clear
what my mission is

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and my mission is
to help people open.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So I don't tend to hang
around with people who

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.500 align:middle line:90%
are resistant to that opening.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.190 align:middle line:84%
However, I would insert
myself in a conversation

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:84%
or in a situation if
I felt like somebody

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.140 align:middle line:90%
was abusing someone else.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to try and
convert the unconvertible.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, you know
you've got to--

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They drain you.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.288 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They
drain you, and there

00:56:19.288 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:84%
will be someone else
who is right for that.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's
an interventionist,

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and he is built for
really tough stuff.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He thrives on it, huh?

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
he's been there.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.750 align:middle line:84%
He's become sober
twice in his life.

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.820 align:middle line:84%
He's gone through
some really dark times

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.650 align:middle line:90%
with his own lack of sobriety.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So he's built to kind of
go to these dark places

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:41.840 align:middle line:90%
with those guys.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're all built
slightly differently.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but at the moment,
my path is really

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.280 align:middle line:90%
to help people open up.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever run
into a psychic vampire?

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody who has that
ability to draw your energy,

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
run away from them.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, yes.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
do this work publicly,

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you will always
meet some of those

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.080 align:middle line:84%
at the periphery of
live events, too.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And for me, the job of--

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
it's not even protecting myself,
because I'm pretty good now

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.210 align:middle line:84%
at knowing how to
deal with those people

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:12.520 align:middle line:90%
when I'm face to face with them.

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It's more protecting
the group I've

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.280 align:middle line:84%
got in the room from the
one or two wayward energies

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.985 align:middle line:84%
who are there to try and
bring the frequency down.

00:57:20.985 --> 00:57:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side of
it is they're a learning

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:24.100 align:middle line:90%
lesson for all of us.

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whether
they're a psychic vampire

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:30.340 align:middle line:84%
or your difficult aunt at
Thanksgiving, it's like,

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.110 align:middle line:84%
us learning how to
deal with dissonance

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and conflict is part of
the human experience too.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So those people are
often great examples

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what
we need to learn.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
what's, I think,

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.660 align:middle line:84%
the greatest attitude
and change is

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.750 align:middle line:84%
when somebody comes
in with attitude

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:48.133 align:middle line:90%
and you can change them.

00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's true.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you see that
metamorphosis, that change.

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's so true.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's great.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on the program, Lee.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Thank you
so much for having me

00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I really appreciate it.

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.610 align:middle line:10%
I've always wanted to
interview an empath,

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.050 align:middle line:10%
and this time, I've
had that opportunity.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.820 align:middle line:10%
And what great information
he passes on to us.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
