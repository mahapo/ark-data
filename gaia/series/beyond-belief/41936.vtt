00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.600 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.256 align:middle line:84%
>> People basically
need to keep on --

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.885 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:26.894 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY:
Throughout this planet,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
many people have treated
death in a very different way.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Cultures all around
this planet do

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
things in a very special way.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on "Beyond Belief,"
Paul Koudounaris, he's

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
an author, he's a researcher,
and he deals with macabre art.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:90%
What is macabre art, Paul?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL KOUDOUNARIS:
Well, in my context,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
macabre art is art relating
to the passage of life.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It's art relating to mortality.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I like to
study are things

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that remind us of the inevitable
passing, especially when it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
relates to human remains, the
decoration in human remains

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and sacred contexts and also
the decoration of bones.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This homage that they
pay to these dearly departed

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%
runs the gamut.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
pictures I've seen,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.145 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to show us some
here, are absolutely stunning.

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They invest a lot
of time and money into jewelry

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and other special artifacts
that they put into these bones

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and skeletons.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do that?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, we
have a photo actually of St.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.014 align:middle line:84%
Luciana that we can show as
a really great example of it.

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: St. Luciana.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.001 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the saint.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Hi

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.541 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: She's in
Heiligkreuztal, Germany.

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:90%
She was transferred from Rome.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Her skeleton was discovered
in the Roman catacombs.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been
in the 17th century.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And by the 18th century,
she was up in Germany.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
She was believed to have been
an early Christian martyr.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that made her someone
who was in a blessed state.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.919 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: If she had given
her life, in the early days,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.876 align:middle line:84%
to found the Christian church,
she was in a blessed state.

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was treated
like a saint,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and she was transferred up
to Heiligkreuztal, Germany,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:90%
a convent.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And she was
completely decorated.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:84%
As we see in the photograph,
she was completely decorated

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
in not just fantastic textiles,
robed in fantastic textiles,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
but completely
decorated in jewels,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.715 align:middle line:84%
a wig made of silver wire, an
incredible production, even

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:28.155 align:middle line:84%
a false face given
to her made of wax.

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She's doing better off
now than she probably was when

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:90%
she was alive.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Probably so.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.836 align:middle line:84%
She was probably
a poor Roman lady

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
who may not even have
been a Christian.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, they believed,
due to circumstantial evidence,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.553 align:middle line:90%
that she may have been a martyr.

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:41.464 align:middle line:90%
So they sent her in this way.

00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They sent her up there,
and they decorated her

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
in this absolutely stunning way.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How big is that--

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's life-size.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --in real life?

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's a skeleton.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is life-size?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
Yeah, it's life-size.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a full skeleton.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.504 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.205 align:middle line:84%
You can see her legs, and her
skull is completely covered.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you, it's funny.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You may wonder, why
give her the fake face?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful
answer to that.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Take
a look at that face.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the theory
was if you gave them

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
a face like that it
would be less creepy.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.665 align:middle line:90%
They were wrong, weren't they?

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:90%
They were wrong.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: By modern
standards, they were wrong.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That looks very weird.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.938 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Considerably
more creepy than looking

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:90%
at the skull.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
At the time, it was thought,
you're using the skeleton,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
but if you give it
a human-like face it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.011 align:middle line:84%
will be easier for
people to bond with it.

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:24.636 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:25.511 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.935 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now what would
they do with this structure?

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
What would they do with it?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, they
would put it in a church.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The convent in
Heiligkreuztal had

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
four of these, all
similarly decorated,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
all outstanding examples
of this type of artistry.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:84%
They had four of
these in the church.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Some churches had more.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Waldsassen Basilica in
Germany had 10 of these,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and still to this day it's
one of the few churches where

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:90%
they still display them.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
There are 10 of these.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Sistine
Chapel of death in there.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
in glass enclosures?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.953 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They're
in glass enclosures, yeah.

00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
There's one in each
side chapel, and there's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:90%
10 of those at Waldsassen.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest extant
display of these.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Over time, as our relationship
with death changed,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
these fully articulated,
beautifully jeweled skeletons,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.695 align:middle line:84%
they were considered to be
too macabre for modern tastes.

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: And
so they were cast out.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.762 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the next photograph
that I brought is St. Faustine.

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: St. Faustine.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.178 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: And St. Faustine
is a beautifully decorated

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:90%
skeleton in Switzerland.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
You know where I found her?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I found her in a storage
unit in a parking garage.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
She was cast out
by the church that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
had owned her, passed around
from church to church,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
like we don't want this fully
articulated jeweled skeleton

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
in our church.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It's too macabre.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of them were cast out.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them were turned away.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.797 align:middle line:84%
And so she wound up, as
I said, in a storage unit

00:04:42.797 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:90%
in a parking garage.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did
you find her, though?

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.985 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It
took about two years.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did somebody tell you?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, I had
started sending emails to all

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
the churches in and
around Porrentruy,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
where she was originally
transferred in the 18th

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
century, saying I'm looking for
this jeweled skeleton that was

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:90%
once in your city.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And they all basically
told me the same thing.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They all said, you're
a crazy person.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
There are no jeweled
skeletons in Porrentruy.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
you're talking about.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.771 align:middle line:84%
And I sent them an
original engraving

00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that showed, yeah,
she was there.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.707 align:middle line:84%
This is the engraving that was
issued when she was originally

00:05:13.707 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in the church.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And they all said,
no, she's gone.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to her.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.954 align:middle line:84%
And then for a
book I was writing

00:05:18.954 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
called "Heavenly
Bodies," which came out

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.843 align:middle line:84%
this year, which is a history
of these jeweled skeletons--

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Big book, by the way.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.256 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's a history
of these jeweled skeletons.

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I had actually already turned
the book in without her,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%
because I'd given up on her.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
call from Porrentruy.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Some lady in an
office said, were you

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:90%
looking for a jeweled skeleton?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we found this
inventory for something

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
in a storage unit.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is what
you're looking for?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.125 align:middle line:84%
So I called the publisher, and
I said, hold on to that document

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I sent you.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:90%
There may be one more.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I flew to Switzerland, and
sure enough we discovered her

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
underneath a bunch of
old pews and unwanted--

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
know right away--

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --it was her?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.707 align:middle line:84%
Because I had the
engraving of her.

00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And it exactly corresponded
to St. Faustine.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.337 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is this like finding
the Ark of the Covenant to you?

00:06:04.337 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, it
might not be that potent,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
but it's an incredibly exciting
moment, well, to realize,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:90%
first of all, that she survived.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Because, to me, these
are more than just

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:90%
unwanted ecclesiastic objects.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
These are incredible
works of art.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
My background is in art history.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what my PhD is in.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
I wrote that book

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to study
these skeletons

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is to change the context under
which we understand them.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, yes, on
the one hand they

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:90%
are failed ecclesiastic objects.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.717 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, they're
incredible works of art.

00:06:37.717 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
They're the finest works
of art ever constructed--

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, they are amazing.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They're the
finest works of art ever

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:90%
constructed in human bone.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When I looked at your
book, I couldn't put it down.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It's also one of those coffee
table books, as you know--

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and that's a complement to you--

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: I
appreciate that.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --where you
keep it, you put it there,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing people do
when they walk into that room

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
is they see that, and they
start thumbing through it.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.035 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They say, what
crazy person would come up with

00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who would do this?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
That criminal right
there in the chair.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.754 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's one.

00:07:04.754 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Show us what else
you brought us.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.721 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, yeah,
there's another slide after

00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
this of St. Callipodius
in Zell am Main, Germany,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.625 align:middle line:84%
another one of these
decorated skeletons.

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's a great one to show at
this point in the conversation,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
because, as I said, a lot
of them were cast out.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare to still
find them in the church.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
cast out, and they

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
were stripped for their
goods, for the material

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
value of the goods.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.226 align:middle line:84%
The goods were sold off
to the highest bidder,

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and the bones were tossed in
the trash when faith wavered.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Callipodius is an
interesting story, this one,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
because he's a
story of a survivor.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
His convent had been
secularized in 1803,

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and he was on the hit list
of things to be disposed of.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The church itself was converted
into a stable, and on the list

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
was get that St. Callipodius,
and pull everything

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
of value off of him,
and toss the bones.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And the night before they went
to get him, he had vanished.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
He just vanished into thin air,
and no one knew where he went.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And about 100 years later,
someone came forward and went

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
to the church in Zell
am Main and said,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
my great-great-great-great-great
grandfather was the parish

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.634 align:middle line:84%
priest, and he would not let
happen to that skeleton what

00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen
to the others.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:90%
So he himself--

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Took it.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: --stole them.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, not his
great-great-great-great-great

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
grandfather, but
great-great-great-great-great

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
uncle, or something.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whatever.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
Some distant-- yeah.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because then I'm implying
clerical infidelity.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which they may
have done in those days.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: That's
another argument.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, and so
the priest himself

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to let
these get destroyed

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.511 align:middle line:84%
the way so many others were
because he knew, even if it

00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
no longer meant that to
the people of that town,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.057 align:middle line:90%
it once did.

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It once had been so
important to them.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It once had been their patron
and an important symbol

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
of the city.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So he had stolen two of them
which were there, Callipodius

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.765 align:middle line:90%
and Alexander and hid them.

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they passed down
through this family's hands

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
for a century until someone
came forward after the mania

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.146 align:middle line:84%
for destroying these
things had passed and said,

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
we would like to give
them back to the church

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
if the church is now
willing to receive them.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
They're not on the alter
anymore in Zell am Main,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
but they're in a
small little room

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
next to the entrance
of the church where

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.851 align:middle line:90%
they are protected.

00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What created that
feeling to try to desecrate

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and also destroy them?

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, on
the one hand, of course,

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:28.537 align:middle line:84%
there's always the normal human
motivation, which is greed.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Grab the jewels.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.495 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's also that
changing conception of death.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The dead were no longer wanted
in the society of the living.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
At one point in time,
the dead in the church

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
in a sacred context
help to sanctify church

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
by connecting us to
the great beyond.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But over time, as our
relationship to death

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
had changed, the
dead in the sanctuary

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.742 align:middle line:90%
were seen as a defilement.

00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have a couple more
photos that I brought.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They're a couple
church bone rooms.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's
look at some others.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.345 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:03.807 align:middle line:84%
They're a couple church
bone rooms, charnel houses.

00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's a charnel
house in Czermna, Poland.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Kaplica
Czaszek, or in English

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:90%
the Chapel of Skulls.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a charnel house
in Czermna, Poland

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.075 align:middle line:84%
which was constructed in
the 18th century, where

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
a priest had taken
all the bones that

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
had come from the cemetery,
and he had completely

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
decorated a small
chapel with these bones

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of mortuary chapel.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, these were places
where the living could --

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
kind of liminal spaces where
two worlds collapsed into one.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The living and the
dead could be together,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and they could have
some kind of dialogue,

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
if not a literal dialogue,
a symbolic dialogue

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
with the great beyond.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But it helped sanctify
the sanctuary to,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:84%
again, make this connection
between the living

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and the dead.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
that I brought in,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
another small charnel house
in the Czech Republic,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.980 align:middle line:84%
this one in Kolin, another
beautiful, wonderful

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:90%
presentation of death.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, these were a
way of affirming sanctity,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
not denying sanctity.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But over time, as I said,
our relationship to death

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
had changed, and the
dead were no longer

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.644 align:middle line:90%
wanted in society in general.

00:11:12.644 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were certainly
no longer wanted

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
in a sacred context.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It is amazing what
they used to do in those days.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
We would never think of
that today, would we?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Not here.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:90%
But in some places, they would.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
Naples, Italy there

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
was a special cemetery which
was a cave system where

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%
bones would be deposited.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And people would go
into that cave system,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and they would adopt a skull.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.902 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the skulls
are in little shrines.

00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:41.735 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Little shrines,
looking out at us.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Little shrines.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
On the one on the left,
it has an inscription

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that says Per Grazia
Ricevuta at the bottom, which

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
means thanks for what
you have given me.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.224 align:middle line:84%
And the other one has
a name, Maria Corbi.

00:11:54.224 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
People would go in there, and
they would adopt the skulls.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Maria Corbi is not the
dead person's name.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the name of the woman
who adopted that skull.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So she would adopt
that skull and go in

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and pray in front of that
skull, venerate that skull,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.774 align:middle line:84%
say prayers for that
skull in purgatory

00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to offer something
from the skull,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and then hope that
the skull would

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.978 align:middle line:90%
give her something in return.

00:12:14.978 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So when Maria Corbi's daughter
is ill, she'll go in there,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and she'll say, you know,
I've given alms for you

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.955 align:middle line:84%
in purgatory, I've helped
relieve your suffering

00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:26.534 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife, and now
I need your assistance.

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And the dead were thought
to provide something

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:90%
for the living.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The one over on the left where
it says Per Grazia Ricebuta,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
something has been
received, thanks

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:90%
for what you have given me.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So someone had been
praying to that skull

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and picked that skull out as
theirs, venerating that skull.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when they were
granted some wish, which

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
they attributed
to the dead, they

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.409 align:middle line:84%
commissioned that
little shrine that

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
says thanks for what you have
given me to thank that skull.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Paul, do these skulls
possess any kind of mystical

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:90%
powers?

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, they
were certainly thought

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.297 align:middle line:90%
to at the time.

00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
They were certainly thought to
by the people who adopted them.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people were so
protective of their skull

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
that they would put little
locked doors on them

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
so no one else could
even look at their skull.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't want anyone
else praying to their skull.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's theirs.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
It's their skull,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and the power of it is theirs.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But this does still
exist in some places.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
The next image should
be from Bolivia.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And in Bolivia nowadays,
there's a belief

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in what they call-- it's
really an old Imara belief that

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.063 align:middle line:84%
has continued to survive,
despite Catholicism,

00:13:25.063 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%
in what they call the natitas.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And natitas, it's kind
of a nickname for skulls.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And means literally the
little pug-nosed ones.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And natitas are skulls
that people still

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
adopt, just like they used
to Naples in the Fontanelle

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Cemetery.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
People still adopt skulls
in Bolivia nowadays.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:90%
The natitas are very popular.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
They cross all
levels of society.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The police department in
La Paz even has two of them

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.165 align:middle line:84%
that they use to
help solve murders.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: On display?

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.414 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
On display, yeah.

00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
In the homocidios
department in El Alto, which

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is a barrio above La Paz,
they have two police skulls.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Juanito is considered to be
the longest-serving officer

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
on the force.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
He's been there for,
like, a century.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And when detectives need
clues, they'll go in

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and they'll talk to
Juanito and Juanita.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
they're interrogating

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
difficult criminals
they'll bring the skulls

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
into the interrogation room.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like Juanito is going
to know if you're lying.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So it crosses all
levels of society.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And every November 8 there is a
fiesta called the Fiesta de los

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.215 align:middle line:84%
Natitas, and people bring the
skulls back to the cemetery.

00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They bring them
first to the cemetery chapel

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.169 align:middle line:84%
so that people can-- I've been
going down there for the last

00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
six or seven years every
November 8 to document this.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a wonderful,
beautiful connection.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.232 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
outsiders think it's

00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
some kind of hokey
superstition, and they

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
think it's some kind
of crude worship.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Even a lot of people in
Bolivia who are not into this

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
think that it makes
them look crude.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wish they
wouldn't think this,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.778 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
beautiful connection

00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:90%
between the living and the dead.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.845 align:middle line:84%
And it's the natural
connection historically

00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and cross-culturally
that people have already

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:90%
had that is here preserved.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And every November
8, they'll return

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to the cemetery for this
Fiesta de los Natitas,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.306 align:middle line:84%
and they'll bring the skull
back to the cemetery in La Paz.

00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
First, they'll go
into the chapel

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.839 align:middle line:84%
so the skull can
hear a mass or hear

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
whenever the priest has to say.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
So the skull will be blessed.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll go
out into the cemetery

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:90%
for this gigantic party.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about 10 or 20 people.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about thousands of
people with thousands of skulls

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
converging on the cemetery,
all decorated, as we see,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
covered over in flowers
as a tribute to the skulls

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to give them some beauty,
making offers for them,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:84%
traveling musicians coming
in to sing for the skulls.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, this
crosses all walks of life.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I will meet crude
people, street people

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
down there who might be
superstitious people.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.985 align:middle line:84%
But I'll also meet physicians
and lawyers who will tell me,

00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
this is my skull
Chaco, and Chaco

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
helped me get through
medical school.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
really believe that?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well,
maybe it's true.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.516 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Maybe it is.

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: I don't know.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.447 align:middle line:84%
I asked the police-- because
the police department,

00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I've gone down there for
several years, as I said,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen various commanders
come and go in the homicide

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
division, and I asked them
all the same question.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, personally?

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten
conflicting answers.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of them say, I think
this is a bunch of hogwash,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and I only allow the skulls
to remain out of tradition.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.295 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Some of them
say, I absolutely believe,

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:90%
and I myself pray to the skulls.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have taken
a more pragmatic point

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
of view, which is maybe the
fairest point of view of all.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
One of them told me, well, I
don't know if the skulls really

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
have any power, but all I
know is that when we use them

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:90%
they work.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
When I bring the skull
into the interrogation room

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and tell them Juanito's going
to know if you're lying,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I will get the truth.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.077 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're willing
to believe it-- of course

00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a psychological
function here.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
There are two poles,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and there's a middle ground.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We have
one last picture.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: We
have one last picture.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is this?

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: We have one
last picture of a private house

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia where 13 miraculous
skulls are displayed.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So some of these people will
collect multiple skulls,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and their our homes will
become like sanctuaries.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a shrine.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Exactly.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the home of a woman
by the name of Dona Anna who

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
lives in a barrio of La Paz.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.734 align:middle line:84%
And people from
all over the city,

00:17:25.734 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
all over the neighborhood
in particular

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
will treat this as they
might treat a church,

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and they will come here
to pray to the skulls,

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to ask the skulls
for assistance.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Each of her 13 skulls
has a specialty.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's one for
marital discord.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.639 align:middle line:84%
There's one for
financial problems,

00:17:40.639 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're suffering from.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There's one that helps
people with schoolwork.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've talk to
people, and it's like--

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's amazing.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: --who
are you here to see?

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well
I'm here to see --

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Nacho is the name of one of the
skulls-- I'm here to see Nacho.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.765 align:middle line:90%
Nacho helps me with my studies.

00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm a student.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they pray to it?

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They pray to it.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
They make offerings to it.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they'll talk to it.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll
believe it talks back.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It could be real.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
It's real for them.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's real for them.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
It's real for them.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's important.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.318 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's real for
them, and that makes it real,

00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:90%
because it has an effect.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you look at life
after death, you personally,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
are you a believer that
there is life after death?

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: George, I
consider myself an agnostic

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%
in all things.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I know enough to know
that I just don't know.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You just don't know.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Are you looking for the answer?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: I'm
looking for the answer,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.289 align:middle line:90%
just like everyone else.

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's what
compels me to continue

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.878 align:middle line:84%
researching all of
this and photographing

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
it is looking for the answers.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe there's
something much greater

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
than myself, and I
absolutely believe

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:90%
there is something beyond me.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not presumptuous enough to
think that I know what it is.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It is baffling.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It is baffling.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Because I--

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: But it's also
kind of exhilarating to think

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
great to be discovered.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.874 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not a fluke.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
We're not an accident.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of
that, you then really

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
have to make that
next jump, that

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
leap to try to
figure out what is

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.892 align:middle line:90%
the other side, what is it for?

00:19:05.892 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It's
the great dark veil.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And everybody throughout
history has always

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
wanted to pierce that veil, to
see what's on the other side.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one thing we
can't know and we can't see.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's the compulsion
to know what lies beyond.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the basis, really, of all
of our systems of salvation.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Because religion itself
really ultimately exists

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
for one main reason, to get
us out of the mortal coil

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.022 align:middle line:84%
and to get us into a
blessed state beyond.

00:19:39.022 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How does the Church
feel about all of this,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican specifically?

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: About Bolivia?

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: About all these skulls
and the way that people treat

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.585 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: As I
said, if the Church,

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
if the Vatican had really been
dedicated to preserving these

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:84%
decorated and jeweled skeletons,
they never would have been

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:90%
pulled apart.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican themselves became
embarrassed about them.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
In part, the Vatican became
embarrassed about all

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
those skeletons they had sent
out of the Roman catacombs

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
because they realized
their methods

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:84%
for ascertaining
their identities were

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
so dubious that a lot of what
they had sent was fictitious.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:90%
It was fraudulent.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
turned their back on it.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
question you ask,

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
context of what we've

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
looked at from Bolivia
and what we've discussed,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
because the Church does
not like it at all.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, when I
talk to them about this Bolivian

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
situation, they're
surprised, and they say,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.892 align:middle line:84%
why haven't I heard
of this before?

00:20:37.892 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you haven't
heard of it is because, I think,

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the Church just
wants to ignore it,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
knowing that not much news gets
out of a place like Bolivia.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But the church has
tried to suppress this.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.022 align:middle line:84%
They've tried hard, and they
just haven't been able to.

00:20:51.022 --> 00:20:53.424 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that they bring
the skulls to the cemetery.

00:20:53.424 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
they do is take them

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.756 align:middle line:84%
to the cemetery chapel
to hear a prayer.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:90%
So there's a syncretism.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a syncretism
between this death

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.042 align:middle line:84%
cult and the Catholic Church,
and the Catholic Church

00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:90%
does not like it.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
The priest does not want
to come out and say a mass

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
in front of an
audience of skulls.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like that.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
think it's demonic?

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They
don't think its demonic.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They just think it's heretical.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.922 align:middle line:84%
But they have tried
to get out of it.

00:21:22.922 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the first years
I went down there,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
there was an
extraordinary occurrence

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
when the priest
refused to come out.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time the
priest refused to come out.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They posted a note.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.725 align:middle line:84%
There will be no service
today on November 8.

00:21:34.725 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
There will be no service
for the human skulls.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you people are
doing is not Catholic.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And the people protested.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It wound up in a near riot.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.132 align:middle line:84%
People took to the streets
holding human skulls

00:21:45.132 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
in the air, marching
through the streets,

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
stopping traffic,
paralyzing traffic,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
chanting we want blessings until
finally the Church backed down

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.247 align:middle line:84%
and they opened the
doors of the chapel.

00:21:54.247 --> 00:21:55.621 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
they were afraid.

00:21:55.621 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we've got people
parading through the streets

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:90%
with skulls chanting--

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Holding
up sticks and stuff.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: --we
want blessings-- right.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
In the end, they're
going to get attention.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the type of
attention the Church wants,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.574 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to wind
up on CNN, people in Bolivia

00:22:09.574 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
parading through the
streets with human skulls

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:90%
wanting blessings.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So the Church isn't
much for this now.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not much in favor of
the veneration of human remains,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
unless those remains
have a provenance which

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
indicates they're
an authentic relic.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
If you have an authentic
toe bone of St. Paul, well,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:31.687 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:22:31.687 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's OK.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Of course.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
very religious--

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Right.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --if you do that.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:84%
A couple years ago,
a long time ago,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
actually, when I was doing
some radio in my 20s,

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I did a story on pet cemeteries
and how people worship also

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
the departed pets.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.172 align:middle line:90%
You've looked into that.

00:22:52.172 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: I have.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been seriously thinking
about doing a separate book

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
just on pet cemeteries, in fact.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I've recently realized
what a marvelously rich topic

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:90%
it is that has been overlooked.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They are a place
where, on the one hand,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
there's an incredible
humor to them.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.995 align:middle line:84%
You look at some of
these tombstones,

00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a
picture of a poodle

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.835 align:middle line:84%
and it says his name was
Sir Lancelot of Camelot

00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a place in
incredible humor.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
it's also a place

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of incredible poignancy.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's this profoundness to
the emotion that is found there

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that is not found in a
normal human cemetery.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the normal
conventions and filters

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have for
dealing with people

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:90%
carry over into grieving.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But those filters are removed
when it comes to animals.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the way we
relate to people and animals,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
even though animals
are part of our family,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a very different
relationship.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
No matter how buoyant
I feel that day,

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.979 align:middle line:84%
I can't walk up to a stranger
and go, eee, you're so cute.

00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I can't go and grab
its cheeks, but I

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:90%
can do that to your poodle.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: That's OK,
because the normal filters are

00:23:59.530 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Even though a poodle is
a member of your family

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:84%
just as much as your brother, I
can't do that to your brother,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.625 align:middle line:84%
but I can do that
to your poodle.

00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that carries
over into death.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the mourning for a
pet, the grieving for a pet,

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
it's much more raw, and
it's much more intimate.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Think about something
for a second.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
members of our family,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
think about the difference
between the way a pet dies

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and the way a person dies.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Most people die in a hospital.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Many pets still die in the home.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They die in this
intimate relationship.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.586 align:middle line:84%
It's a profound passing
with the family.

00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
die at the vet--

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had two cats
that I've put down.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Both of them, they
injected the cat,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and I held the cat
until it passed.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that was
emotional for you, wasn't it?

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.661 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Very emotional.

00:24:45.661 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The passing of a pet is, in a
way, much more emotional to us

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
than the passing of
a person because we

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
are intimate with the passing
of the pet in a way we're really

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
not with the passing of a
person most of the time.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's a
hospice thing where

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
the person's dying at
home, the death of a pet

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.267 align:middle line:84%
is really much more
profoundly intimate

00:25:06.267 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:90%
than the death of a person

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, it is.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:12.355 align:middle line:84%
I have seen cases, Paul, where
the family dog is put down.

00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it is traumatic
for the family, for the kids.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The animal has become
part of their family.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: It is.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The thing about the pets--
I say this sometimes,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.461 align:middle line:90%
and people will get mad at me.

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
They won't like this
point that I'll make,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's true-- pets don't
have a personality per se,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:90%
because they're not persons.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They have behavioral
characteristics

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
which mimic what we
consider a personality,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
but the personality is really
something we project on them.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Because a personality,
it's a human construct

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
involving premeditation and
this intellectual approach

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to the way we
adapt to the world.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what we project onto the
animal is a piece of ourselves.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And the animal, because
it's a kind of tabula rasa,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
out of the goodness of its
heart and its innocence,

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
it becomes that thing.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We project a personality
onto it, and it becomes that.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.726 align:middle line:84%
But because of that, when a
pet does, truly a piece of you

00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:14.225 align:middle line:90%
dies.

00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:90%
A pieces of you--

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, there's
no question about it.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: --dies with that
pet in the way it doesn't with

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:90%
a human being.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
When that cat dies,
that's a piece of me,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
because I created the vivacity
and the personality that

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.165 align:middle line:90%
exists within that animal.

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It came from me.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some people will have
the animal cremated and keep

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:90%
the ashes, for example.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
Which, in a weird way,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that's almost a lot more
ghoulish to me than putting

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:90%
them in the pet cemetery.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, I do too.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, after looking

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
at these human skulls and the
way they've been decorated,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine
how weird it seems

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.722 align:middle line:84%
if they would do the same
thing with a cat or a dog?

00:26:51.722 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: I
can imagine that.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It would be stranger.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, OK, if
I don't seem strange enough

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
already, after I came back
from Germany photographing

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the jeweled skeletons,
I actually so longed

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:84%
for a jeweled skeleton of my
own that I mail ordered a cat

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:84%
skeleton, and I completely
covered it in jewels.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
sitting by my bed.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You have one?

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.076 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:27:14.076 --> 00:27:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's sitting by my bed.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It's posed with a--

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I knew it.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.986 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: --book of
Mother Goose in its hands.

00:27:18.986 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's reading
a bedtime story.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So actually, that
I can understand,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:23.891 align:middle line:90%
because I've done it.

00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There have been people
who have reported that when

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:31.135 align:middle line:84%
their animal dies they literally
feel its presence afterwards.

00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Yeah.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They see paw prints
on the bed and things like that.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:90%
These are real feelings.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.986 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: These
are real feelings.

00:27:38.986 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And for all I know,
these are real phenomena.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I
would like to investigate.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.560 align:middle line:84%
If I do go forward
and continue to look

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
into the pet
cemeteries, it's really

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:84%
something I'd like
to investigate

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:84%
is this idea of animal
ghosts or visitations

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.602 align:middle line:90%
by our pets that have passed on.

00:27:52.602 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just make sure
it's not Stephen King's "Pet

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Sematary" that you do.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.625 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well,
see, that's misspelled,

00:27:57.625 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's got the S. So as
long as I keep the C in front

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Cemetery and not that S,
I'll be clear of Stephen King.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Pet cemeteries,
people burying them,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
do they put the bones
in a little casket?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: They can.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Most pet cemeteries
will allow you

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to have a viewing, kind of
like our version of a wake.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
They won't embalm the
animal, but they'll

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.359 align:middle line:84%
allow you to have a viewing
of it before they bury it.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you buy the plot.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS:
You buy the plot.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You commission a headstone
or some kind of memorial.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people I
know, it's actually

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.677 align:middle line:84%
been conveyed to me that
there are several people who

00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:37.687 align:middle line:84%
will actually sleep
with the urn of ashes

00:28:37.687 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:90%
if they've had the pet cremated.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
They will continue
to sleep with it.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, after
what you've told us,

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that they sleep with skeleton
bodies of your dearly departed,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could do that too.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.176 align:middle line:90%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Right.

00:28:47.176 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
They slept with the
animal during life,

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:84%
so really they're continuing
to sleep with the animal

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.521 align:middle line:90%
during death.

00:28:52.521 --> 00:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that
seems really wrong about it--

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:90%
because there's no wrong to it.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.627 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
beautiful in its way,

00:29:01.627 --> 00:29:03.668 align:middle line:84%
because it continues that
incredible connection--

00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that seems
wrong about it in our society

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.669 align:middle line:84%
is, as I've said,
we live in a society

00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:84%
where the dead are supposed to
be segregated from the living.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But as I've said also,
if you look historically

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and cross-culturally,
the dead still

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:90%
had a role to play in society.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it allows the pet
an ability to continue

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to have that role
in the household.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you no longer
believe that someone who

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
relishes the bones of a human
or the bones of an animal that

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
there's anything wrong
with these people.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KOUDOUNARIS: Well, it
depends on the person,

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and it depends on what
they're doing with it.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you heard
this news story from Sweden,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.843 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was a couple years
ago, about a woman who

00:29:42.843 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
was arrested because she
had a skeleton in her home

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that she was somehow
attempting to have

sexual intercourse with.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:90%
