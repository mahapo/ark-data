00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:21.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:10%
About 10 years ago,
I had an author

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:10%
on my program talking
about the Bilderberg Group.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into exactly
what that group is

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
and how they try to manipulate
and control this planet.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:10%
The book was called "The True
Story of the Bilderberg Group.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:10%
The author was Daniel Estulin.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And this book took off
like a rocket ship,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
sold 7.2 million copies,
and people are still

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:90%
talking about it.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
It's now evolved into a movie,
and we'll talk about that too.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.542 align:middle line:84%
But Daniel, it's good
to see you in the flesh.

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL ESTULIN: It's amazing
to finally actually meet you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.534 align:middle line:10%
after so many times that you and
I have talked on radio shows.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
here in the studio.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.788 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the invitation.

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember when we did
that show, the calls that you

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
got from people who were
so concerned about what

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
was happening on this planet.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
How did you even get into
investigating the Bilderberg

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Group?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTULIN: I was coming out
of the intelligence service.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And I basically didn't really
know what to do with myself.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:90%
That was about 2003 or so.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to make money,
because I needed to eat,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
like everyone else.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
I knew a lot of stuff.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I had access to a
lot of documents.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I could write a
book about something

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.562 align:middle line:84%
interesting enough for people
to get their teeth into it.

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It was right about the time
when Dan Brown put out his book

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.134 align:middle line:90%
on "The Da Vinci Code."

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Bilderberg has nothing to
do with the Da Vinci Code,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's the whole
idea that there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
is a power behind the
scenes, the mystery

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
behind the mystery that could
be very, very old or not so old.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, is that
it actually takes people

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
into the world beyond their
common everyday understanding.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had-- initially,
I wanted to write a book

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the Pinay Circle,
which is another far

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
more secretive organization
than Bilderberg.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't
enough information--

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
documents and papers and
photographs which actually

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:90%
showed--

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're pretty private.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: They're
very private, more so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
than the build Bilderbergers.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:10%
But as far as
Bilderberg is concerned,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:10%
the Russian intelligence
had always a lot

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:10%
of interest in
this organization,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:10%
going back to the
first meeting in 1954.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, I
can do this book.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:10%
We had a lot of information,
a lot of documents.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.026 align:middle line:10%
So we can actually
make people believe

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:10%
that these people are real.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:10%
It's not some kind of a
wacky conspiracy theory.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
and they are real.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And they do meet every year.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:10%
Lately, Daniel, they've
been publicizing

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:10%
where they're meeting.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I think--
you know, humbly say,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I think I have
something to do with it.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You took the
book and turned it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
into a movie called
"Bilderberg, the Movie."

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.804 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Exactly.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:10%
But the first step necessary
for actually winning

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:10%
is to know what the war is.

international bankers, and

and were the people running
the wars, the markets,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:10%

they never say in public.

differ from the United Nations?

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTULIN: Bilderberg is-- as an
organization, was founded back

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:10%
in 1954, although the
initial impetus to get

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:10%
this group of politicians,
members of the elitist circles

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:10%
together goes back
to 1948 to 1949.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Bilderberg basically is
your form NATO alliance.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It's Western Europe, Canada,
and the United States.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
There are other
organizations, such as Council

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
on Foreign Relations goes back
to the early 1920s, their roots

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:84%
as Chatham House
and the Roundtable.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.656 align:middle line:84%
That's the British
elitist circles.

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
Trilateral Commission

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.507 align:middle line:84%
founded by David Rockefeller
and Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1973.

00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:10%
You have the [INAUDIBLE] Circle.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.006 align:middle line:10%
You have The Bohemian Grove.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:10%
You have think tanks from
[INAUDIBLE] foundations.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
There were a whole slew of these
organizations working together

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to basically move forward
a very particular agenda.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
That agenda is the liberal
banking financier agenda.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You can also describe
it as the concept

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of infinite growth
on a finite planet, something

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't work.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing the
consequences of that today.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But again, Bilderberg is one
of many of these nodes working

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
together to push forward a
very particular agenda, which

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with the interests

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.052 align:middle line:90%
of 99.9% of the population.

00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was going
to say, on the face of it,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
just on the outside
looking in, it

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
sounds like a
wonderful idea, a group

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of people getting
together to try to better

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:90%
mankind and this planet.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's not necessarily
the case, is it?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: It's not the case.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea-- again,
you can rephrase it.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about the
central banking warfare model.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:10%
That's what, basically,
these people represent.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And Bilderberg-- when
you go back to 1954,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
it's basically-- it's fused
the winners and the losers

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:90%
in the Second World War.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, you
have the winners.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:90%
You had the allies.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:90%
You had Britain.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:90%
You had France.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:90%
You had the United States.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:90%
You had Canada.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.043 align:middle line:84%
And you had the losers, You
had Germany and the Vatican.

00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:90%
You had Italy.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Fuse them together to
make a common front

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.925 align:middle line:84%
against the new socialist bloc
led by the Soviet Union post

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:90%
World War II.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Bilderberg and
all these other organizations

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:90%
are about.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not about one world
government, new world order.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.659 align:middle line:84%
It's about one world
company limited corporations

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that have a lot more power than
any government on the planet.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.794 align:middle line:10%
And the whole idea
behind that was actually

00:06:57.794 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:10%
proposed by George Ball, who was
the Undersecretary for Economic

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:10%
Affairs, and JFK.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:10%
And Johnson, back in
the 1968 Bilderberg

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.477 align:middle line:10%
meeting in Mont Tremblant
in Canada, when he said--

00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:10%
and I loosely paraphrase-- how
can we create corporations that

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.351 align:middle line:10%
can give orders to governments?

00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And that basically--
what Bilderberg is,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is one of these nodes.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret society.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people--

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because again, one of the things
that happened with this book

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is we've always
known, we've always

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
seen coup d'etats,
changes of governments,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:90%
the financial crisis.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:90%
All history--

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.876 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That has
and will happen.

00:07:31.876 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It has
always happened.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But people always talk
about the Jews, the Masons,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:84%
the Illuminati, the
Jewish Masonic conspiracy,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.489 align:middle line:84%
they-- whoever
these "they" were.

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly, my book on
the Bilderberg Group comes out,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.642 align:middle line:10%
and there's photographs
and documents,

00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:10%
as you saw on the film.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:10%
And these "they" have a name.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And they have a face
and their documents

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:10%
and their deliberations.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:10%
And we know what these
people were up to.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And we know who founded them.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, one
of the early meetings,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
1954 through 1957, they're, in
part-- not fully, but in part--

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:90%
funded by--

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
financed by the
CIA, so again, as

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
part of this greater
European project.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:10%
So there's a history
behind these secret private

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.851 align:middle line:10%
organizations.

00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually,
with this book,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
show how this whole thing
was put together going

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:90%
back quite a bit in the past.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this quote,
unquote conspiracy theory

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.164 align:middle line:84%
is no longer a conspiracy
theory but a conspiracy.

00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the real deal.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Exactly.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a real deal.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:10%
But it's-- again, it's a node of
all these other organizations,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:10%
think tanks, foundations who
work together towards moving

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:10%
forward a very
particular agenda,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:10%
which has very little to do
with the interests or the needs

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:10%
of 99% of the
world's population.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
members are there?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Anywhere from
110 to about 130, 135.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They usually break up into--
it's a three-day meeting--

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
They break up into four
or five different groups

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
of about 20 people each
to make it manageable.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why you don't
have more than 130.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You have representatives,
a lot of them

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
we already know as a result of--

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.709 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know who they are?

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Give us a couple names.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Rockefeller,
Kissinger, Brzezinski--

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clinton.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.859 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: --Henry Kravis,
Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton.

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the people
who have come to these meetings.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is our current
president part of the group

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:90%
yet?

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.113 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: He's not
part of the group.

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
He's the enemy of these
liberal banking financiers.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: He could
never be part--

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want him in there?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: He couldn't
be part of the group.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
He represents the
alternative model, just

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.289 align:middle line:90%
like Silvio Berlusconi.

00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
The former prime minister
of Italy is no longer--

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's out.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: --part of the group.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
He's out, but he was
never part of the group.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to be, to a certain
point, a globalist financier

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the
Bilderberg elite.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Or someone who could become
one in the near future

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
is a potential
member of this group.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:90%
You have European commissioners.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
You have European
high-ranking politicians,

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
the president of
European Central Bank,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
of General Reserve, of
European Central Bank,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank--

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they always attend these
meetings for obvious reasons--

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
as I said, high-ranking
commissioners,

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
high-ranking representatives
of the British elite circles.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Sitting presidents never
come to these meetings.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So Bill Clinton came before
he became president in 1991.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
At that meeting
in Baden-Baden, I

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
believe, in Germany, David
Rockefeller explained to him

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.852 align:middle line:90%
what NAFTA was all about.

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:17.893 align:middle line:84%
And he asked him, if he
were to become president,

00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:90%
would he support it?

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And Clinton said to him, is
that important to you, David?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And he said, of course it is.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.906 align:middle line:90%
And he shook his hand.

00:10:23.906 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And Rockefeller said, to him
thank you, Mr. President.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting how
powerful these people are.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: And
actually, Jim Tucker,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
out of his book, Hillary
Clinton attended before-- well,

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
she was never president.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:41.135 align:middle line:84%
But she attended in
2006 meeting in Canada,

00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
on the outskirts of Ottawa.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Barack Obama-- if you
remember that famous episode

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
where he just kind of
vanished off the airplane when

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:90%
he was sitting on the tarmac.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:90%
That was also before.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It was in 2008 in
Chantilly, Virginia, before.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:90%
The meeting was held there.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, high-ranking banking
representatives-- people

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank, IBM,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Microsoft, Google, PayPal.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
All of these
individuals go there,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
because again, these
are the financier

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
banking elite
political circles who

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
represent a model,
which is based

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
on infinite growth
on a finite planet.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't Russia and
China part of the Bilderberg

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Group?

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Because
again, Bilderberg

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:90%
is former NATO alliance.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It's Western Europe, Canada,
and the United States.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Trilateral Commission
is Americas--

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
North, South America;
Europe; and Asia.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:90%
That's trilateral.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
A few members from
Australia get in.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Almost no one ever
from Africa gets in.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The Council on Foreign
Relations is a brother or sister

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:90%
organization to the Bilderberg.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:90%
That's an American organization.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.906 align:middle line:84%
You have a Council on Foreign
Relations in other countries

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:90%
as well, regionally.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.488 align:middle line:10%
But again, one of the things
that we're seeing on the world

00:11:49.488 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:10%
stage, as far as the
collapse of the world economy

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:10%
we are witnessing as
we speak, is the fact

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:10%
that this model, liberal
banking financier

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:10%
model, which is based on the
concept of infinite growth

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:10%
on a finite planet,
no longer works.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So all these organizations, the
Bilderbergers everybody else,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
they're looking for a way out.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the model that they
represent is no longer viable.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so Russia and
China, they have

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to work together on
a supranational level

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to come up with an
alternative model.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But what is interesting
about that--

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
it's not Russia or China.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not the United
States against Russia.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:90%
This is not chess.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Because the whole idea--

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski and Kissinger and
Rockefeller and all these

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
think tanks and
foundations talking

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.057 align:middle line:84%
about the grand chessboard,
the game of chess between the--

00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- chess is
something that you

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
play between two players.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not between two players.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
They are not countries
at war with each other.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:90%
They're global projects.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And as global projects, the
elite use a different game.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And that game is Bridge.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.880 align:middle line:84%
In a chess game, Russia and
China do not participate.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But in a global Bridge
game, which is a game,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
card game played
by all elitist--

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody's in.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Exactly.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
From the Queen of England
to George Soros to Buffet

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to Winston Churchill,
they all loved

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Bridge, because it's the most
amazing card game in the world,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
as far as the Russian
intelligence, for example,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:90%
is concerned.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
We use Bridge as a
way to understand

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
how these global projects
work and fit together

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:90%
into a particular pattern.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And in that pattern,
both Russia and China

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
participate as
separate projects.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, how does
the Bilderberg Group operate?

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:90%
How does it function?

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It's an annual
meeting of anywhere

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:90%
between 110 and 130 members.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
What basically happens
is the United States

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest member of
this Bilderberg alliance,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
gets about a third
of the delegates.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Smaller countries, such as
Spain or Greece or Denmark,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
they will get about
three delegates.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's a
high-ranking politician,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:90%
a member of a media.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they invited in?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: They're invited in.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You cannot buy your way.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not a lobby media
where you can actually

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
pay a certain amount of money
and buy your way into the--

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I've never
been asked to participate.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I, unfortunately,
have not been either, George.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So we are in a very
exclusive company--

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you,
if they invited you?

00:14:11.496 --> 00:14:13.936 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I would, simply
because I think it's--

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:84%
not because I want to
be a part of Bilderberg

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:84%
but because meeting
with intelligent people

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.099 align:middle line:90%
is always a lot of fun.

00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, as soon
as the meeting was over,

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd come to your
show, and I'd give you

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.617 align:middle line:84%
all the exclusive
information about what

00:14:24.617 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
these people talked about.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But still being there
as a fly on the wall,

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.142 align:middle line:84%
listening to what
these people talk about

00:14:30.142 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:90%
is always a lot of fun.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.474 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
your question--

00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:90%
120, 130 members.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
They meet once a year.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.519 align:middle line:90%
Every country has--

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't call them a manager.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I would call it
a representative.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:10%
What they do is they
send, at the beginning

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:10%
of the year, a list of
possible invitees, about 10,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:10%
15-member list
from each country.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:10%
There's a steering
committee, which

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:10%
included people such as
Kissinger; as Zbigniew

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:10%
Brzezinski; David Rockefeller,
when he was alive;

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:10%
And they basically decide
which individuals are

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:10%
to be invited, which are not.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The decisions are
reached via consensus.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Nobody tells anybody what to do.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has to agree.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's--

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
getting paid to run this?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: They don't get paid.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
There are friends of
Bilderberg organizations

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.877 align:middle line:90%
that finances part of it.

00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't need the money.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've got the machine
with different-- between you

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and I, we don't have the
machine that prints money.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So they can do
that kind of stuff.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, what's interesting,
it's done through consensus.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times, they invite
not only one world globalists,

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
but also potential
opinion leaders who

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.549 align:middle line:90%
might not be fully on board.

00:15:39.549 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Through these meetings,
they try to convince them

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.131 align:middle line:84%
that it might be a
good idea-- again,

00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:47.185 align:middle line:84%
it's not done as the mafia Cosa
Nostra would do their business.

00:15:47.185 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But close.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I wouldn't
really say that.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the
idea is that there's

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.042 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ways you can pressure
people into doing things.

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
people say to you,

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
[MUMBLING] things are they
talk about, it never comes out.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they're afraid
they're gonna get killed.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not some silly
conspiracy theory.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not for old geezers sitting
in a dark room holding hands,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
staring at a crystal
ball, planning

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%
the world's domination.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
The world is a
very complex place.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.722 align:middle line:84%
What basically is
done-- if you come in

00:16:14.722 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and you understand
the rules-- it's

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
called Chatham House rules,
meaning that you can listen.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:90%
You can take notes.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:84%
You can not reveal
anything which is

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:90%
said within the organization.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they do what,
burn you at the stake?

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.299 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: No.

00:16:26.299 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to do that.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
They just ostracize you, meaning
that you are no longer invited

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.107 align:middle line:84%
to important supranational,
non-government--

00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're out of the club.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: You're
out of the club.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.904 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants to be out
of the club, especially

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
when you're in the
club for a long time,

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
meaning that anybody
can pick up the phone

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and call any of the other
members anytime they wish.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.417 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, when David
Rockefeller-- well,

00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
he will never pick
up the phone again.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.666 align:middle line:84%
But any one of these
other individuals--

00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
be it Henry Kissinger, be it
representatives of the European

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Royalty--

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.916 align:middle line:84%
when they no longer
answer your phone calls,

00:16:57.916 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:90%
you know you're in trouble.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So again, you don't need
to worry about somebody

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
taking you physically out.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact is that
you'll be ostracized,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.292 align:middle line:84%
and for most of
these people, that's

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:84%
far worse punishment
than getting killed.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.072 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
film was incredible,

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:90%
"Bilderberg the Movie."

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.905 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Thank you.

00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's up
on Gaia.com now.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I'm very
grateful to Gaia.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You guys have a
special audience.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:90%
People-- knowledgeable people--

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.077 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
other platforms out there.

00:17:22.077 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lot of interest
from other platforms.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is I
didn't want for my film

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to be just a piece of meat.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be on a site
where people could go--

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.582 align:middle line:90%
because Gaia is a community.

00:17:33.582 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
People who understand--

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's growing.

00:17:35.712 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: And it's
a growing community--

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
people who understand what
the real world is like.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're stepping
through the glass

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
onto the other side into
a parallel universe.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I want.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I want my film to be somewhere
people who actually watch

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it understand what it's
about, take that information,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and then distribute it amongst
their friends and friends.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we can save the
world against these people.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we?

00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You think-- you
really believe we can?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:90%
They're strong, Daniel.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very strong.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: They are strong.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But again, the central
banking warfare model,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
based on the concept of infinite
growth on a finite planet,

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
is dead, which means that the
financial system, it's over.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And they need an
alternative system. s

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And the alternative system,
at present, doesn't exist.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
There are ideas-- because again,
to come up with a new Bretton

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Woods or to come up
with a new Yalta,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not something
that you whip up

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:90%
in a corner store in 15 minutes.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
You need at least
a couple of years

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to get everybody on board.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
a couple of years.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we have about a
year till the whole thing

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.636 align:middle line:90%
collapses onto itself.

00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going to be
living all back to "Mad Max."

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just what we need.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Or we're going to
be living in a world of "Blade

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Runner" or
technologically advanced.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
transhumanism.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.001 align:middle line:84%
Or we're talking going way
back to the idea of society--

00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
what the Bilderberg

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Group is trying to prevent,
that "Mad Max" scenario?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I think right
now, it's the survival.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Because their very
survival is at stake.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
the Bilderbergers--

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.484 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So is ours.

00:19:14.484 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: So is ours.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But again, they don't
think of us as people.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
We are inferior, and then
just put an adjective.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're cattle.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: We're cattle.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
they need to survive.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because again, at a
supranational level,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
it's not a homogeneous group.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
They're different groups, as--

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:84%
just as we saw in
the United States

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
elections, different
groups supporting

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:90%
different candidates.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at it
on the supranational level

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
as far the-- from
the bird's eye view,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:84%
they're different groups
fighting for the survival.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Before, you had
enough for everybody.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
There is no longer
enough for everybody.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And like in the film, "The
Highlander," only one group

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:90%
can survive.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And their survival
depends on which

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
economic model is successful.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the current model,
which is based, again,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
on infinite growth
on a finite planet,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.672 align:middle line:84%
central banking
warfare model is dead.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, you have a
new book coming out in Spanish.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.657 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it'll
be in English--

00:20:10.657 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Yes, sir.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --about the
phenomenon of 2016.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:84%
What has happened to this
planet, specifically the United

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
States, where people
are so frustrated, they

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
don't want the status quo?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're making as
many changes as they can,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
hoping that something
different will come along.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.759 align:middle line:84%
How frustrated do you
believe the people are?

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I think
we could see that.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a planet
at war with itself.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And an organism at war
with itself cannot survive.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:90%
What

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I do in my book, I don't look
at the current administration

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:90%
as good or bad.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It's irrelevant.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I look at it as a
surgeon or a scientist who

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
finds a two million-year-old
body frozen in ice, who

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:84%
looks at the individual
behind it-- who,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
what, and how this individual
became the president,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and what that does to
the future of humanity.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:84%
For example,
Russian intelligence

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
knew back in 2012
that anybody linked

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
to the current liberal
banking financier model,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning Hillary
Clinton and that crowd,

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.391 align:middle line:84%
could never be elected to
the White House in 2016.

00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They knew that?

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.473 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: They knew that?

00:21:23.473 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, in 2014--

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hillary
didn't know that.

00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: She didn't know that.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think she
still is fighting

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like the old general who is
still fighting the First World

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.835 align:middle line:90%
But the point is that in 2014--

00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you the exact date.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It was on the 5th of
November in Dayton, Ohio.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2000--

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: 2014.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the day of or the day
after the elections, the Senate

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%
and Congress elections--

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The midterm--

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: The midterm
elections, exactly.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
High-ranking members
of what later

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
would become some of
the representatives

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of the current administration
met with high-ranking members

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Russian administration.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
collusion that we're

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:84%
seeing right now in the
mainstream media, the Twitter,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
the Facebook, the elections.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with that.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.679 align:middle line:90%
Two nuclear superpowers--

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they have
the right to get together.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Of course they do.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh, we need peace.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Exactly.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:10%
So the two nuclear
superpowers, well the people

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:10%
at a very high level, were
basically looking at ways

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that this model--

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:10%
again, liberal banking
financier model,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:10%
which was at the very
end of its cycle--

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:10%
would not get in and
who would actually

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:10%
get into the White House?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't know at
that time, did they, in 2014?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: The Russian
intelligence knew back in 2012.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
exactly the individual.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.409 align:middle line:90%
But the profile--

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They knew the concept.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: They knew the
profile of the person who

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:90%
would win the White House.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:90%
They actually had two persons.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:90%
One had the current president.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, they also
had Rand Paul as far

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
as the political spectrum.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But they thought he didn't
have enough business acumen.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So the model that they had
as the president in 2016

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:84%
was exactly who actually
got into the White House.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And again, why?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Because anybody linked
to the liberal banking

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.915 align:middle line:84%
financier model could
not win the presidency.

00:23:18.915 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet, it was close.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very close.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It was Never
close, ever close.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looked close.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:90%
She had the popular vote.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:90%
He had the electoral college.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Do you ever
follow WWE wrestling?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.256 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:33.256 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've looked
at it in my day.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
publicly admit it.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
But again, it looks close.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But the whole game,
set and match--

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The winner
is already determined

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
in the dressing room, where
they talk to each other.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It's scripted
before the game's played.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:10%
But the reason, again,
it's easy to understand,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:10%
that model is dead.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:90%
They needed a new model.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And what they are
doing right now--

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and this is where Russia
and China come in.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
for an alternative.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And the alternative to this
liberal banking financier

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
model-- and Bilderberg is one
of the representatives of that

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:90%
model--

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is the dismantling
of countries--

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
end of Westphalia.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:10%
Going back to 1648, the end
of countries, nation-states,

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera, and the
creation of regional economic

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:10%
blocs not unlike Europe, which
is a political union as well,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:10%
but strictly
economic-based blocs.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, there's lots of
talk about how our election was

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
hacked by the Russians.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
A professor of computer
science, J. Alex Halderman,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
talks about the
possibility of how

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.307 align:middle line:90%
that hack might have occurred.

00:24:39.307 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:10%
>>J. ALEX HALDERMAN: I'm a
professor of computer science

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:10%
and have spent the last 10 years
studying the electronic voting

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:10%
systems that our
nation relies on.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
My conclusion from
that work is that

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
our highly-computerized
election infrastructure

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
is vulnerable to
sabotage and even

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to cyber attacks that
could change votes.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
These realities risk
making our election

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:84%
results more difficult for
the American people to trust.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I know America's voting
machines are vulnerable,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
because my colleagues and I
have hacked them repeatedly

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
as part of a decade of research
studying the technology that

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
operates elections and learning
how to make it stronger.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We've created a tax that can
spread from machine to machine,

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
like a computer
virus, and silently

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
change election outcomes.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We've studied touch screen
and optical scan systems,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and in every single case,
we've found ways for attackers

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to sabotage machines
and to steal votes.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
These capabilities are
certainly within reach

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:90%
for America's enemies.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
As you know, states choose
their own voting technology.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And while some states are
doing well with security,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
others are alarmingly
vulnerable.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
This puts the entire
nation at risk.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
In close elections,
an attacker can

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
probe the most
important swing states

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.820 align:middle line:84%
or swing counties, find areas
with the weakest protection,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and strike there.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
In a close election year,
changing a few votes

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.745 align:middle line:84%
in key localities could be
enough to tip national results.

00:26:11.745 --> 00:26:14.202 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, Daniel,
kind of frightening.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Something we've talked
about on our radio show,

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" for
years now with a person

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Bev Harris,
who says that there are

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%
dangers with electronic voting.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:84%
This professor, Dr.
Halderman, agrees with that

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and admitted that
he and his group

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
hacked into election central
and did some changing

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
for his research purposes.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.827 align:middle line:84%
What's to prevent other
countries from doing the same?

00:26:43.827 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: I don't think--

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.125 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nothing.

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:90%
He just said it.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Anybody, any country
could hack the system.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But from there to
Russians did it--

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it far-fetched?

00:26:56.067 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It's far-fetched
because the only thing

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
we've had during the last year,
since the last elections--

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.404 align:middle line:84%
aside from thousands
of committees

00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
meeting and deciding
if the Russians had

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:90%
anything to do with it at all--

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that Steele's report
has been totally discredited.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And William Binney
last week came out

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and said the hack was internal.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do know.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And today, anybody who is
14 years old and relatively

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:84%
capable on a computer-- because
kids today are far more capable

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:90%
than most of us--

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.367 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're good.

00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:25.741 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: --can
hack in a system

00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and make it look
as it actually went

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:90%
through the Russian government.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, then, we need to
go back to the old punch card

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: We may have to.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But again, you go back
to the 2000 elections,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you go back to the
2004 elections,

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
they were outright
stolen by the--

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1960, Kennedy
stole the election.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no question that
he stole Illinois and Chicago

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
with votes with
help from the mob.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:90%
And they got it done.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.922 align:middle line:84%
And that was without
the electronics.

00:27:51.922 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
electronics in 1960.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Not only in the
United States-- in Russia,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
the last parliamentary
elections in Russia last year,

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
they were stolen by
Russia's party led

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.855 align:middle line:84%
by Putin and Medvedev,
not only was it stolen,

00:28:03.855 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
where you had a
minimum 10% swing.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It was 150% swing, I mean,
when the Russians steal,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:90%
they steal big.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They go big.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do about all this?

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: I don't know.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:18.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are we stuck
with this kind of possibility?

00:28:18.577 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I think it
goes back to the fact,

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
as the elitist circle said--
going back to Churchill

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:90%
and beyond--

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
you can't leave in the
hands of the populace

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
the important decisions,
like electing presidents

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and prime ministers of nations.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because again, these are the
people who run the world.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because no president or prime
minister anywhere in the world

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
works for the people, for the
nation-state that elects them.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They represent
the elite circles.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you cannot leave
these decisions in the hands

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.888 align:middle line:84%
of people who would actually
vote for somebody who is going

00:28:44.888 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to represent their interests.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.108 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
have hacks, and that's

00:28:48.108 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:84%
why you have elections stolen,
not only in the United States,

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:90%
everywhere in the world.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're having
all kinds of things

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:84%
happen on this
planet these days.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Things are changing like crazy--

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
problems with North Korea,
big changes in Zimbabwe,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:84%
changes in Venezuela,
Syria's still up in arms.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.079 align:middle line:90%
Is it out of control?

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: On one level, it is.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you understand the
background, the fact that it's

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
a war for survival between
two systems which can never

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
get along, which is the
liberal banking finance

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
system and an alternative
group behind the current

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
administration,
then all this stuff

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.580 align:middle line:90%
is being put into perspective.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, you see a lot
of articles and opinions

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
from very credible
individuals saying

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
this individual, the current
president, he's insane.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
He's picking a fight with
Canada, our closest ally.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
He's doing the
same with Germany.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
easy to understand

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
if you understand that
all of these people

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
are his enemies, because they
represent the liberal financier

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:84%
banking elite circles who
want them out of power

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and destroyed.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
right now, again, it's

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
a fight for survival
between two models--

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
one, liberal banking
financier model, and the other

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
yet to be born,
which surely is going

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.799 align:middle line:84%
to be based on the idea
of these economic regions,

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.965 align:middle line:84%
where each region is going
to have its own currency.

00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
They're going to work
together on a global stage.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.644 align:middle line:84%
And again, one of
the objectives,

00:30:21.644 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
we're seeing right now

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is the dismantling of
the petrodollar system

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:84%
which is why you
have Saudi Arabia--

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
backed by our dollar.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: But again, the
current administration, they

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
need to get rid of the
petrodollar system.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They're dismantling
it on purpose.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Because Bretton Woods,
International Monetary Fund,

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:90%
the World Bank--

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:84%
all of these
institutions represent

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that model, which is dead.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
doing it on purpose.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And all these people who are
saying that Saudi Arabia,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:84%
they're actually working against
the interests of the United

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.467 align:middle line:84%
States, because Americans,
they want uni-polar world,

00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and these people want to
join a multi-polar world.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.360 align:middle line:90%
They want to join--

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:90%
they're not doing that.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They're part and parcel of
this effort-- global effort

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to dismantle the system and
create a parallel system which

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with
the petrodollar model,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.435 align:middle line:84%
based on this very concrete
idea of Bretton Woods.

00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Because Bretton Woods people are
saying, Bretton Woods is dead.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not, because International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank,

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
the Bretton Woods institution,
so the model itself, is alive.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:90%
It's dead, but it's alive.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
make sure that they create

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
a new model which still is
not up and running, because it

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
takes time for that model
to be actually put together.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
As I said, new Bretton Woods,
a new Yalta takes time.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does China
fit into this equation?

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: There are
six global projects.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's not countries.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not the United
States against Russia,

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:84%
against China, against
Canada or England.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in this, if
it were countries,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.147 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't explain Democrats
against Republicans, Antifa,

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Black Lives Matter against
the police or the government.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't explain
those things.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:90%
So they're not countries.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:90%
They're global projects.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are currently six
global projects, or seven.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But the Vatican, beginning 2012,
was taking out [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the coups d'etat,
where the black pope,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.110 align:middle line:84%
the Jesuit pope took
over from Benedict XVI.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, you have
six global projects.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:90%
One is called the New Babylon.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:21.750 align:middle line:90%
It's New York.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It's liberal backing financier
model, whose representative, up

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:90%
until now, was Hillary Clinton.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The other global
project is London.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:90%
We can call it New Jerusalem.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Hasidic
Jews, Kabbalists, the Queen,

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:90%
the Rothschilds.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Are

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The third project
is Grand Europe,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:84%
which is European
Union plus the Vatican.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
A fourth is Grand Eurasia,
with the epicenter in Moscow.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.220 align:middle line:90%
The fifth is Datun, China.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:90%
And the sixth is the Caliphate.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, this caliphate
was Black Caliphate,

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Wahhabi Caliphate.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.200 align:middle line:84%
That caliphate lost, and a
new caliphate is being born--

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Red Caliphate, Sufi Caliphate
with the capital in Damascus.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.135 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by
these global project

00:33:06.135 --> 00:33:09.959 align:middle line:84%
is they're not six projects
fighting individually.

00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:84%
As I said to your
earlier interview--

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they seem they are.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:13.728 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: They're not.

00:33:13.728 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Because the game is not chess.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in a chess
game, you couldn't

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:90%
fit six global players.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There are only two
players involved.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And that's why Brzezinski,
in a very coy manner

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:10%
in his great book,
"Grand Chessboard,"

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:10%
it's a great deception
making us believe

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:10%
that the world plays chess.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't play chess.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
The elite play Bridge.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can play Bridge
with four or six players,

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
because you have
52 cards, which you

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:90%
can divide into four players.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gets 13.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.385 align:middle line:90%
Or if you have six players--

00:33:42.385 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not a Bridge
player, by the way.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm more of a chess player.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Me too.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very good game.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And you need it to understand
the geopolitics of the world.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can have six players.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Simply have 52 cards,
plus the two jokers.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, you have 54 cards,
and you can divide it

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:90%
in nine cards each player.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And these are projects
who will play in teams.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, London, the
New Jerusalem, up until now,

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
they played who was
their team member?

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:90%
The Black Caliphate.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:90%
They played together.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a liberal banking
financier elite in New York,

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
and they played with China
as a project together.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The Russians, which aren't
Russians, but Eurasia--

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:84%
they're playing, up to a
certain point, with Europe.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But it all depends on the
geopolitics of the world

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.240 align:middle line:84%
from here on out, over
the next year or so,

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
to see how these projects
are going to come out.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the British,
they called for the game,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:90%
but the Black Caliphate lost.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So now, they need a new partner.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And it depends--
it remains to be

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
seen how these agreements
are going to be worked out.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the logical
conclusion for the Chinese

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians
to work together.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, China, Datun,
Russia, great Eurasia,

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.670 align:middle line:90%
for them to work together.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But for that to happen, a lot
of other things need to happen.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Because China, historically--
if you go back traditionally

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
historically-- is the
epicenter of the universe.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, since
you bring up China,

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:84%
there's talk about
the new globalization,

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:90%

China's picked it up.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, China is the new
[INAUDIBLE] One Belt One Road

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In 30 years--

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:90%
dramatic.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTULIN: One belt
is a land route--

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:10%
16 countries-- 12
Muslim, four Orthodox.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:10%
One road is Maritime
over 40 countries.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:10%
One of the ideas, especially
through the Maritime route,

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:10%
is to push the United States
away from any areas of interest

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.290 align:middle line:10%
to the Chinese, and
the United States

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:10%
back towards this
area of influence,

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:10%
which is North America.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.154 align:middle line:84%
But China has always
been a trinity.

00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
One Belt and One road

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:84%
needs another point for China,
for the president, Xi Jinping,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:90%
to become emperor.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And for him to become
emperor, they need Russia.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that he wants?

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.843 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: And they need
the mandate of the skies,

00:37:30.843 --> 00:37:33.440 align:middle line:90%
as they call in Chinese.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And this mandate can
only come through Russia.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:10%
Because both One Belt and One
Road are based on interests--

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:10%
political, military,
and economic interests.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that President, soon

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to become emperor, Xi
Jinping, can be consecrated

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
as the new emperor is
for Russia to be involved

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:90%
on the point of values.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is the new [INAUDIBLE]
part of this One Belt One road

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:84%
initiative, and that's why the
two countries are working very,

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:84%
very close together
to try to work out

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.520 align:middle line:90%
some kind of an agreement.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, because
again, Russia and China,

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:90%
we are not friends.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.231 align:middle line:90%

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:90%

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget, George, --

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Russian nuclear missiles not
only point at Washington.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They also point at Beijing.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
friction and conflict

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:90%
between the two countries.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
China wants to be
recognized by Russia

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:84%
as the economic
powerhouse, superpower.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians yearn for
the Chinese to recognize them

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.240 align:middle line:84%
as a nuclear and military
superpower, which

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Russia, with every passing
day, is becoming less and less

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.550 align:middle line:90%
so of a military power.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly, we are third
world, or even fourth world,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.940 align:middle line:84%
as far as economic
power is concerned.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot at stake.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But again, the only way that
this can actually play itself

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:84%
out beginning, especially
now after the 19th Communist

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party,

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.690 align:middle line:84%
is for these sites to
work out an agreement.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The Russians, the Chinese
are looking for ways

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.476 align:middle line:90%
to join forces.

00:39:15.476 --> 00:39:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
very difficult--

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that
common denominator?

00:39:18.235 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: The
common denominator

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:90%
is survival of the fittest.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you need
an alternative model.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
That model is not liberal
banking financier model

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%
based on infinite growth.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:90%
That is dead.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:90%
A new model has to come out.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And that model this dismantling
of countries and creation

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:84%
of economic regions, which
means that Russia, most likely,

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to be divided in half,
traditionally, by the Euros.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Western Russia,
one economic bloc;

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Russia, Turkey, Iran,
the Balkans, Syria,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and ex-soviet Turkish
speaking countries;

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:10%
and then the eastern part would
join, the Koreas and probably

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:10%
Japan.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.239 align:middle line:84%
Because if Japan joined China,
you'd be completely absorbed.

00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How realistic is this?

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: It is very realistic.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Because again, the system--

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.730 align:middle line:90%
one system is dead.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
an alternative system.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's already on the table
at a supranational level

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:90%
between countries.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.790 align:middle line:84%
If you remember,
not too long ago--

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.600 align:middle line:90%
it was in May of this year--

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Henry Kissinger met with Putin.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
He met with the current
administration the United

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he also met with
President Xi Jinping.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And Henry Kissinger is a
very important representative

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:90%
of the--

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:90%
the supranational elite circles.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot take these
kinds of meetings lightly.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They have a very
important role to play

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.490 align:middle line:84%
on the geopolitical
behind-the-scenes agenda

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:90%
of these elite circles.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.389 align:middle line:84%
But again, a lot is left
to be said and done.

00:40:43.389 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons why
the current administration--

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.480 align:middle line:84%
going back to what
I said before--

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.355 align:middle line:84%
is going after Canada,
dismantling transatlantic

00:40:50.355 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and transpacific agreements,
North American Free Trade

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
agreements, because these
agreements are part and parcel

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of the old liberal
banking financier

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:84%
model based on infinite
growth on a finite planet.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, the whole idea--
we've had three crises,

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:84%
historically, over
the past 2,000

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
years which changed completely
the face of society.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:84%
One, between the fourth
and the sixth century

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:84%
when the entire elite circles
in the Mediterranean Basin

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.200 align:middle line:90%
were wiped out.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The next crisis, within the
16th and the 17th century,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.740 align:middle line:84%
we had the same effect,
except the elite survived.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a vertical
structure-based feudal

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:84%
structure on the
owners and the slaves.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are living
the end of capitalism.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Because capitalism is dead.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It is based on the idea
of infinite growth.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
it's all over, huh?

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.699 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: It has to be.

00:41:38.699 --> 00:41:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Because again, in
1991 when the Soviet

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Union, the socialist
alternative model collapsed,

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
we were left with one
model for the entire world.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And that model lasted
less than a decade.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in the year 2000,
we had the dot-com bubble.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:57.770 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, we had the
Lehman Brothers collapse.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, Obama, for the
first time since Reaganomics,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
eliminated every
representative--

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan--
from his Economic Council.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:84%
In 2014, he said, we're
not printing more money.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.450 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Or it's the world, or
it's the United States.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
going to happen again.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: And in 2016,
we had the elections,

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and we had Brexit.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing--
again, the model is dead.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.470 align:middle line:90%
New model needs to be born.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at
these global projects.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not countries.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not China against
the United States.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.010 align:middle line:84%
They're global projects,
which are working in tandem

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to see which one
of these projects

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:90%
has a better chance to survive.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, how do you see
humanity in the next 10 years

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:90%
merging together?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to happen?

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It depends on
which model ends up winning.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
If the current
American administration

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:84%
gets the upper hand, we're
going to cashless society.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.620 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Bitcoin.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:90%
We're going to cryptocurrency.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Are going to zeros and ones.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to transhumanist.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:84%
If the Chinese, Datun; if
they get the upper hand

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.720 align:middle line:84%
with the Russians,
then what you have is

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:84%
goal-based and supported
by the natural resources.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a different model.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult. There
are a lot of vectors

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of options
and possibilities.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.255 align:middle line:84%
A lot is left to be
done over the next year.

00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
time, more or less,

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
we have before the
system collapses.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And in this year, we need
to come up with a new model,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:84%
make it work, and
save the world.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does artificial
intelligence fit into this?

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Artificial
intelligence

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:84%
fits into the model of the
current administration.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's humanities,
transhumanities, post-humanity.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this in my
book, "TransEvolution--

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
A Coming Age of Human
Deconstruction,"

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
the capability of the
human mind from here

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.420 align:middle line:90%
to the next generation or so.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a project
called Russia 2045.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be reaching
this point, as Ray Kurzweil,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:84%
said of synchronicity
between man and machine--

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.972 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Ray
calls this very ominous.

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.584 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY KURZWEIL: By
2020, we'll have

00:44:02.584 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:10%
computers that are
powerful enough

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:10%
to simulate the human brain.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:10%
But we won't be finished
yet with reverse-engineering

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.990 align:middle line:10%
the human brain and
understanding its methods.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.590 align:middle line:90%
One of my main themes--

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and I've developed this
thesis over 30 years--

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.690 align:middle line:84%
is that information technology
grows exponentially.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:10%
The power of computers,
our understanding

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.754 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain, the
spatial resolution of brain

00:44:25.754 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:10%
scanning, the number of bits
we move around the internet--

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:10%
I mean, many different measures
of information technology

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:10%
double every one year,
every 11 months, 13 months,

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:10%
depending on what
you're measuring.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So these technologies will be
a million times more powerful

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:90%
within 20 years.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the speed
of exponential growth

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:90%
is itself speeding up.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.530 align:middle line:10%
So in 25 years,
these technologies

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.656 align:middle line:10%
will be a billion times more
powerful than they are today.

00:44:53.656 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:10%
And we've already seen
that kind of progress.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.988 align:middle line:10%
When I was an
undergraduate, we all

00:44:56.988 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:10%
shared a computer at MIT
that took up half a building.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
The computer on your
cell phone today

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is a million times cheaper
and 1,000 times more powerful.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.070 align:middle line:10%
That's a billion-fold
increase in price performance

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:13.020 align:middle line:10%
of computing since I
was an undergraduate.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
really that scary?

00:45:14.527 --> 00:45:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: In the
last 50 years, we've

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.757 align:middle line:84%
learned more than in the
entire history of mankind.

00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:84%
In the next 20, we're going
to learn more in the last 15

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:21.750 align:middle line:90%
than the last--

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: --human history.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It
increases constantly.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: And we're
going to get to the point

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.677 align:middle line:84%
where every 11 months
or so, as Kurzweil

00:45:26.677 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:84%
said, we're gonna be doubling
the knowledge of humanity,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things he
said-- or he didn't say--

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.480 align:middle line:84%
not in the clip, but he said it
many, many times-- by the year

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.724 align:middle line:84%
2021, the capacity
of the computer

00:45:38.724 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to equal the
capacity of human brain, which

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.860 align:middle line:84%
means the cost of the brain
is going to be $1,000, which

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.070 align:middle line:90%
is the price of a computer.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the year 2041 or
2050, depending how quickly

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.235 align:middle line:84%
we get there, we're looking
at a billion times faster.

00:45:52.235 --> 00:45:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
sounds great to me.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: It is
to a certain point.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the
whole idea-- if you're

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.350 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from the point
of view of the elite circles,

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.602 align:middle line:84%
they don't need
six billion people.

00:46:03.602 --> 00:46:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They need to get rid
of most of humanity.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
300 million, period.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.466 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: They need
whatever the number

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that they need of
the golden billion,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:90%
as we say it in Russian.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.561 align:middle line:90%
They don't need more than that.

00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you
don't have enough.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Progress and
development of society

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is directly proportional
to population density.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to have growth,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.590 align:middle line:84%
be it exponential or otherwise--
it could have more people,

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.670 align:middle line:90%
more wealth--

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
but there's only so much food
and natural resources and water

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:84%
on the planet Earth, which
means for the Rockefellers,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.890 align:middle line:90%
as an ideal--

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.300 align:middle line:84%
not for the
Rockefellers, the man

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.720 align:middle line:84%
who is now dead, but the
ideal of the elite to survive,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:90%
most of us have to die.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is the--

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:46.250 align:middle line:84%
one of the key
questions I pose and try

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to answer in my film on
the Bilderberg Group.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then, look into
your crystal ball, Daniel,

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and give us some
hope for the future.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.282 align:middle line:84%
Will we, as mankind,
be the victors?

00:46:57.282 --> 00:46:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: I think we can be.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Because on the global
stage, the people

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.584 align:middle line:84%
who had complete
control of society--

00:47:04.584 --> 00:47:06.250 align:middle line:84%
then again, we can
talk about democracy.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Democracy doesn't exist.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing
it for what it is.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We think it exists.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: The mask
comes off, and you

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:90%
have hardcore dictatorship.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's enough
people out there

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%
at a certain level of power
who understand that today,

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:20.800 align:middle line:84%
we have more of a
chance than ever.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the elitist circles,
whether they represent

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
one group or the
other, are weakened

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:90%
as a result of this collapse--

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of the systemic collapse
of the global system.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:34.544 align:middle line:84%
So this is our chance to
make something out of it.

00:47:34.544 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have one chance.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.775 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: I think
we have one chance.

00:47:36.775 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
take care of it.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we win?

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.155 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: I hope so.

00:47:40.155 --> 00:47:42.130 align:middle line:10%
Which is, again,
going back to why I

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.600 align:middle line:10%
decided to put my film on Gaia.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:10%
Because we need this
awareness, the level--

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.030 align:middle line:10%
increase the level of
human consciousness

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.640 align:middle line:10%
for people who
actually understand,

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.500 align:middle line:10%
for the community of
people to work together

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:10%
and improve the lives of
everybody per square kilometer

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:10%
of space against nature.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.492 align:middle line:10%
Knowledge is power.

00:47:59.492 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:10%
And it's one of the
reasons I want to make sure

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:07.000 align:middle line:10%
that this kinds of programming
is as extensive as possible

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.860 align:middle line:10%
in as many languages
as possible.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Because people around
the world, they

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
need to understand that
the world that they

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.112 align:middle line:84%
see on television has very
little to do with reality.

00:48:16.112 --> 00:48:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good luck with
"Bilderberg the Movie."

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTULIN: Thank you, sir.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTULIN: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
story of a group called

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the Bilderberg Group
that [? truly ?] wants

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to control the entire planet.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.050 align:middle line:90%
But will they?

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.370 align:middle line:10%
With people like Daniel Estulin
telling us what's going on,

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't think they will.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.314 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:48:38.314 --> 00:48:39.480 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Beyond Belief."

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:90%
