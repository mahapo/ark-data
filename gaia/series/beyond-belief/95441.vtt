00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.632 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSAN MASINO: Hey, do
you believe in ghosts?

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.134 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen a ghost?

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.678 align:middle line:84%
I'm paranormal
researcher Susan Masino,

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.305 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to tell
you that ghosts do exist.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.516 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
about encounters I've had

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and ghostly activity
that others have had.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I will make you a believer.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.481 align:middle line:84%
This is "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.358 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: And I
think many people today

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.693 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.194 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER:
People are basically

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.156 align:middle line:84%
going to keep on to help
uncover what really happened.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.533 align:middle line:84%
>>FEMALE SPEAKER: It felt like
something was watching me.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.744 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: We weren't
given all the information.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.495 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.005 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
over the next 30 minutes

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.215 align:middle line:84%
you very well may
become a believer

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.176 align:middle line:84%
in the other side,
the paranormal,

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.636 align:middle line:84%
with our special
guest Susan Masino,

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:58.391 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about ghostly things
right here on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.392 align:middle line:90%
Susan, welcome back.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Thank you, George.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.686 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:04.022 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of your books,
"Secrets of the Universe,"

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.817 align:middle line:84%
where you talk a lot
about the other side.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.819 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, I self-published
this book about a year ago,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.618 align:middle line:84%
less than a year ago, called
"Secrets of the Universe,"

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:20.705 align:middle line:84%
and it's seven chapters on
seven different subjects.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.666 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a primer
to the paranormal.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.292 align:middle line:90%
Because I--

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.251 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A how-to book.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.712 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Exactly, if you want
to get into it a little bit.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.964 align:middle line:84%
Because I've read so
many books, and I've

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
been a long time listener
of "Coast to Coast."

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And, oh, I've
been such a big fan,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.431 align:middle line:84%
and you have such
amazing people on.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.475 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to go to sleep
at night because you

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
want to listen to
the whole show.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.857 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote seven chapters,
one on synchronicity.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:53.279 align:middle line:84%
One is on your chakras, your
energy, kind of the light

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.031 align:middle line:90%
that comes through you.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.325 align:middle line:90%
One is on universal laws.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.702 align:middle line:90%
One is on past lives.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.914 align:middle line:84%
One is on ghost adventures,
because I've been on a few.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:07.085 align:middle line:84%
And then one is called My
Jesus Wears an AC/DC T-shirt.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.252 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:10.295 align:middle line:84%
That's where your rock
experience comes in.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.258 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yes, because my Jesus
does wear an AC/DC t-shirt.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.008 align:middle line:90%
He's a big fan.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your take,
then, on the paranormal?

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.057 align:middle line:84%
Have you made your
own conclusions

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle line:90%
about what you think it is?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:28.064 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, I think there's
many parallel universes.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:32.694 align:middle line:84%
And like with UFOs, which I
didn't get into that in my book

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.196 align:middle line:84%
because I'm saving that whole
thing for another project.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.072 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another one.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:36.906 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:42.203 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but I think that people
and entities might not

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.706 align:middle line:84%
seem like people to us,
but they come in and out

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:49.377 align:middle line:84%
of dimensions, especially
UFOs, that they're

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:50.295 align:middle line:90%
able to cross through.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people believe that.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, yeah,
and otherwise it just

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.465 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make sense.

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.594 align:middle line:84%
You know, otherwise, you'd think
we'd see the UFO coming in,

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:58.469 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.847 align:middle line:84%
NASA or somebody would
pick them up a long time

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.099 align:middle line:90%
before they'd even fly over.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.476 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
pop in and pop out,

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.979 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing
with shadow people.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.316 align:middle line:84%
I've seen shadow people,
and that's very common.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.861 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen things--
well, my house

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.281 align:middle line:84%
is kind off-- I think it
might be on an Indian burial

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.158 align:middle line:90%
ground in Wisconsin.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.493 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
them in Wisconsin.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:23.036 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.871 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might not be the
best place for a house.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.704 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Exactly.

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.666 align:middle line:84%
But we have-- we
sage when we need to.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.169 align:middle line:84%
We cleanse the house
when we need to,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:90%
but we have a lot of traffic.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.589 align:middle line:84%
We definitely have
people in and out,

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.382 align:middle line:90%
and my son is very psychic.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.509 align:middle line:84%
Even as a child, he
would see people.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.764 align:middle line:84%
He would come upstairs and
say, Mom, we have another one.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:90%
We need to move him.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.433 align:middle line:90%
Move him on his way.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.353 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny
because I've always

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.648 align:middle line:84%
wanted to see a full
body apparition, which

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.609 align:middle line:90%
is not always possible.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.737 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get to do
that and a lot of people

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
wait their lifetimes
and never see that.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.788 align:middle line:84%
And my experience actually ties
in with the Titanic experience.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.748 align:middle line:90%
If it's OK to go back to that.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
talked about that

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.168 align:middle line:84%
in a previous program
about your little boy

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.838 align:middle line:84%
Jamie, who you are
now convinced was

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.882 align:middle line:90%
the designer of the Titanic.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.425 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes, exactly.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.428 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought the
exhibit through Chicago

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
in 2000, we took him
to see it after he

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.432 align:middle line:90%
had had this experience.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.518 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he freak out?

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.437 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He loved it,
but he was emotionally

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.438 align:middle line:90%
shaken by it also.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.439 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could tell.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.023 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:38.528 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he was very-- he got very
emotional when he got close.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they had a piece of
the ship that was actually

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.534 align:middle line:84%
like as big as the side of
a house that was on display,

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and that was-- it had
a window with a crack

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.955 align:middle line:90%
through it and everything.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very spooky.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.879 align:middle line:84%
But we'd gone down there, and
I was with his sister also,

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.216 align:middle line:84%
and he was very obsessed with
the men that died in the boiler

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:05.054 align:middle line:84%
room, because they were trapped
when the emergency doors came

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:05.555 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was the
tragic part of that ship.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.059 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Because none
of them could get out.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.353 align:middle line:84%
And so when we went
to the exhibit,

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:14.939 align:middle line:84%
they had a boiler that they
actually had brought up

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.026 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom of the
ocean, and it was on display

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:22.071 align:middle line:84%
and it had mirrors on
both sides and curtains.

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.657 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
thought, wow, this

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.785 align:middle line:84%
is amazing that they
actually have a real boiler.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.122 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at it,
and I looked down to the right

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.957 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like a
whole line of boilers,

00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:36.461 align:middle line:84%
because there's
mirrors on both sides.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.047 align:middle line:84%
And then when I looked
to my left, what I saw

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:43.217 align:middle line:84%
was a full-size painting,
life size painting,

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:45.595 align:middle line:84%
of a man shoveling
coal into the boiler.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.637 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The boiler room.

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.472 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.433 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And I remember
distinctly thinking to myself,

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.602 align:middle line:84%
boy, they went all
out for this exhibit.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.229 align:middle line:84%
That's very impressive
to show, because they

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.606 align:middle line:90%
wore heavy clothing.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.356 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.983 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He had
like woolen pants on.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:05:59.609 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The real deal.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.819 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, he had the
high-necked white shirt

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.239 align:middle line:84%
with the suspenders, and
he had like a newsboy cap.

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:06.699 align:middle line:90%
He had dark hair.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.161 align:middle line:84%
He had a mustache, and
he was shoveling coal.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had a mustache once.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:17.043 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And so I looked up
at him and I thought, you know,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.962 align:middle line:84%
that's very impressive
that they would do that.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:24.133 align:middle line:84%
And as we slowly moved with the
crowd, and my son was only six,

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.969 align:middle line:84%
so he really couldn't-- he
wasn't at the eye level that

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.846 align:middle line:90%
my daughter and I were at.

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:33.392 align:middle line:84%
And as we got closer to that
side, I looked up at him

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.603 align:middle line:90%
and he turned and looked at me.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:39.649 align:middle line:84%
And when he moved--
when paintings move,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.858 align:middle line:90%
it scared me so badly.

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:42.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the eyes shifting?

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.279 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, he looked
at us like who are you?

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:50.326 align:middle line:84%
Like his head just swiveled
around like-- like we scared

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.202 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:55.414 align:middle line:84%
And he scared us, and I closed
my eyes for just a second,

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.834 align:middle line:84%
and I was staring at
myself in a mirror.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.794 align:middle line:84%
And there was no man and
there was no painting.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.087 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing was there.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.839 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And I leaned
over to my daughter

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.049 align:middle line:90%
and I said, did you just see?

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.301 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, a man?

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:09.178 align:middle line:90%
And I said, shoveling coal?

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.223 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, with suspenders?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.099 align:middle line:90%
And I said, a hat?

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.725 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, and a mustache?

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:16.519 align:middle line:84%
And we just kind
of, you know, we

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.938 align:middle line:84%
were whispering because
the crowd was around us

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.859 align:middle line:84%
but we were both
completely in shock.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.529 align:middle line:84%
And what was weird is that
I made him into a painting,

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because that made sense
in my head, I guess.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.661 align:middle line:84%
To her, he looked
like a man that

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:36.289 align:middle line:84%
was standing where there
was nowhere to stand.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.416 align:middle line:84%
So she couldn't figure
out how he got over there.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What his
place was there.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.126 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.335 align:middle line:90%
How did he get over there?

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:43.379 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
nowhere to stand.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And we both saw him.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.716 align:middle line:90%
We could draw a picture of him.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.969 align:middle line:84%
And that was, I mean, that
was a full body apparition,

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.804 align:middle line:90%
who was aware of us.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What changed your
whole perspective on this?

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.185 align:middle line:84%
Was it your little boy
or were you a believer

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife before that?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.104 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:03.107 align:middle line:84%
No, I read every book, you know,
after-- when I was a child,

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother talked
about her mother coming

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.405 align:middle line:84%
to see her after she
died to say goodbye.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.575 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell us that
story and from then on, I

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.578 align:middle line:84%
was obsessed with every book
I could get my hands on.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.205 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
middle school, there

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.249 align:middle line:84%
was like Hans Holzer
was like the only guy.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a giant then.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:21.834 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.128 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but he was like the
only guy in the library

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.797 align:middle line:84%
so I read everything
I could get on him.

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And just always investigated.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.721 align:middle line:84%
I ended up hooking up with
a couple of psychic mediums

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:37.683 align:middle line:84%
that was at the symposium
that we met at in Minneapolis.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:40.519 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone on ghost
adventures together.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:43.731 align:middle line:84%
We went down to Bobby
Mackey's in Kentucky.

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:46.442 align:middle line:84%
We went to a brothel in
Deadwood, South Dakota.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.736 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're into this
now in a big way, aren't you?

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.696 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Well, not-- I was.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:55.493 align:middle line:84%
Not as much as I used to be
because I got sick when I went

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.535 align:middle line:90%
down to Bobby Mackey's.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean you got sick?

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.122 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh my goodness.

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
This place-- some people
won't go there anymore.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.504 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do other
people get sick there?

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.255 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.715 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they've been
actually possessed.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.343 align:middle line:84%
People have been
possessed there.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:14.887 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
tourist attraction

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.766 align:middle line:84%
where people-- they have groups
on weekends that go and do

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
their ghost adventures, and
I will never go back there.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.064 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you emotionally
sick or physically sick?

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.524 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I got physically sick.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:30.486 align:middle line:84%
We went there the night
before on a meet and greet.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.863 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really think
about-- and I should have,

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:35.241 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't take it seriously.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.159 align:middle line:84%
I thought, we're just
going to go to the bar--

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have a
little nice time.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.954 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, we're
going to meet everybody.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.039 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next night
we're going to be-- we

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:90%
were live on online.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.044 align:middle line:84%
We did this big-- we
had about 30 people,

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.588 align:middle line:84%
so we broke it into
like six groups of five,

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.674 align:middle line:84%
and we did this
big investigation.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.217 align:middle line:84%
But the night before
I went in there,

00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:55.553 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think about
using my white light

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.179 align:middle line:90%
and my protective shield.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:58.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would?

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.392 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I just-- I
didn't take it seriously,

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.019 align:middle line:90%
and I should have.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.605 align:middle line:84%
And I went there, and I was
with my two psychic girlfriends,

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:12.111 align:middle line:84%
Donnette Cooke and Tamara
Gleason, who love this stuff.

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:15.197 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that
really got me to come up

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:17.658 align:middle line:84%
and to meet you in
Minneapolis and everything.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:20.202 align:middle line:84%
And we were with
their cousin Chad,

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.412 align:middle line:90%
so there were the four of us.

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.789 align:middle line:84%
And as we walked
into the bar, as soon

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.751 align:middle line:84%
as we got to where
the dance floor was,

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.962 align:middle line:84%
the room spun,
just for a second.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:34.091 align:middle line:84%
And we all four felt it, and
we all stopped and looked

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:35.176 align:middle line:90%
at each other.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:38.637 align:middle line:84%
And as they were looking at
me, it was like in slow motion.

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:41.349 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend Tamara
looked at me, and she said,

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.184 align:middle line:90%
did you just feel that?

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:46.937 align:middle line:84%
And when she said that,
something walked through me.

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:47.855 align:middle line:90%
It was just like--

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:48.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt it.

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.315 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel a chill?

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.402 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: It was like a burst
of air that went through me.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could tell-- it
was like the "Ghostbusters."

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I felt slimed.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.076 align:middle line:84%
I was just like-- I
turned around and I went--

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:00.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you feel icky?

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:01.369 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.036 align:middle line:90%
No, I did.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.205 align:middle line:90%
Because it was my whole body.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.707 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was, whatever it
was went right through me.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:09.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that the beginning
of your illness there, or what?

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.505 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, it didn't start
then, but I turned around,

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.506 align:middle line:90%
and I looked behind me.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.342 align:middle line:84%
And I went, ew, I
said, something just

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.676 align:middle line:90%
walked through me.

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:18.677 align:middle line:90%
Oh god.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.722 align:middle line:84%
And they were making fun of me,
because they're Reiki masters

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.599 align:middle line:90%
so it bounced off of them.

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:24.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they feel it?

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:25.518 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: They did.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.729 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they did, but
it went through me.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:30.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As long as
it comes out, right?

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:31.899 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Exactly.

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:35.861 align:middle line:84%
But it came out in a bad
way because that night, we

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
had a good time,
and we went back,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.325 align:middle line:84%
and we came back to
the bar the next night.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:45.788 align:middle line:84%
And we did a long
investigation and-- actually,

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:49.125 align:middle line:84%
they-- I don't like the
provoking that people do,

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.209 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of people do it.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.544 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To try to get them out.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.795 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah, like bring it.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.547 align:middle line:90%
What do you got, you know?

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.091 align:middle line:84%
And there was a group
downstairs in the basement

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:90%
where the well is.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.219 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous well
that's closed up now.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.054 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, some
don't take it seriously.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.347 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh, not at all.

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:90%
They want proof.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.976 align:middle line:84%
They want to see
what they can get,

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.478 align:middle line:84%
and there was actually
a man downstairs

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:12.189 align:middle line:84%
that got pinned up against
the wall by something

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't see, and when
that happened he took off.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he
deserved it, huh?

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.821 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well,
they were provoking.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.823 align:middle line:84%
They were saying,
you know, show me.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:21.782 align:middle line:90%
You know, bring it.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:22.825 align:middle line:90%
Well, we were just--

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.827 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they got
their wish, didn't they?

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.787 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, they
did in a big way.

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:30.332 align:middle line:84%
But that night, we
were there pretty late.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:33.335 align:middle line:84%
We were drinking coffee, we
were not drinking any alcohol.

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
We went and stopped and
ate at the same place.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:90%
We all ate--

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.424 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of party is that?

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.301 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: That was the
end of the weekend,

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.344 align:middle line:84%
and we all ate at
the same restaurant.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:45.014 align:middle line:84%
We ate all the same food, and
we went back to the hotel,

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.433 align:middle line:84%
and we were going to drive
back to Wisconsin the next day,

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.809 align:middle line:90%
which was a seven hour trip.

00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:49.727 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:53.105 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And something told
me to pack all my stuff.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:56.025 align:middle line:84%
This intuition just said,
pack all your stuff.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.486 align:middle line:84%
All you got to do is
get up, get dressed,

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
and you're out in the morning.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.365 align:middle line:84%
And about 5:30, 6 o'clock
in the morning, I woke up,

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.911 align:middle line:84%
I felt really weird
like, you know,

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.121 align:middle line:84%
when you're coming
down with the flu.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.708 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the bathroom,
and without being graphic,

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I was in there for hours.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just sick.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:20.007 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: It was violent,
and it wouldn't stop.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:23.719 align:middle line:84%
And it took them hours
to get me together enough

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.055 align:middle line:90%
to get me into the car.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure I
could have taken the trip.

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:29.642 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well,
I didn't want to.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.018 align:middle line:90%
I begged them to leave me there.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:31.894 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just keep
me in bed and--

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah,
I begged them to.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.563 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me die.

00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I said, I'll fly home.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I was honest, I
said, I'll fly home.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.319 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, we're
not leaving you like this.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.612 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:45.449 align:middle line:84%
And so they packed me up, and
they put me in the backseat.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:49.036 align:middle line:84%
And we still laugh to
this day, because there

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.872 align:middle line:84%
are two in the front seat, I'm
curled up in the back and--

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Praying you don't
get sick again, right?

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Well, exactly.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean they made
something for me to use.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.547 align:middle line:84%
And my girlfriend
was-- all I could

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.508 align:middle line:84%
do is curl up like in a fetal
position to stop the pain.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must
have been miserable.

00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:05.844 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, I've
never been that sick.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:09.265 align:middle line:84%
I've had the flu before, and
I've never been that sick.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.601 align:middle line:84%
And she did Reiki on
me for seven hours

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%
on the way back to Wisconsin.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.315 align:middle line:84%
And they dropped me
off, and within an hour

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:21.569 align:middle line:84%
after they left the house,
the vomiting started again.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.028 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What possessed you?

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Something got you.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.407 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Something
got me big time.

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.116 align:middle line:90%
And this lasted--

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
that whoosh, right?

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.619 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, yeah, it
was whatever it was and it

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:32.746 align:middle line:84%
wasn't-- I don't
know what it was,

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:37.418 align:middle line:84%
but I was like that Sunday--
it started Monday morning.

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:40.671 align:middle line:84%
I was like that Monday, Tuesday,
and then I ended up in the ER

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:41.505 align:middle line:90%
on Wednesday.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you were a
believer prior to that?

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:44.091 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:44.967 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.802 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think you let your guard

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.263 align:middle line:90%
down to let this happen to you?

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I didn't
take it seriously.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:53.809 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think-- you know,
you hear all these stories

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:56.228 align:middle line:84%
and had been on TV a
bunch of times and people

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.814 align:middle line:90%
were there that night to party.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:01.483 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
that, you know,

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:06.238 align:middle line:84%
you're coming into a space that
not only should you respect--

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:06.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:09.074 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: But you
should protect yourself.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.284 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you did neither.

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I didn't at all.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.954 align:middle line:84%
And I will never-- I'll
never go back there.

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.539 align:middle line:84%
I'll never go in
that building again.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.374 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've said other
people have been sick, too.

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:17.875 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:18.876 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar things?

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:22.504 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yes, and it's
usually violently ill.

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:25.174 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bet that's not
great for his tourism, is it?

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.134 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He makes
money every weekend.

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More coming.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.427 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: People
come every weekend.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sicker people
get, the more people come.

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.974 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: More people
want proof of something.

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.559 align:middle line:90%
And there's layers of things.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
There's the
Underground Railroad,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.981 align:middle line:84%
then there was-- it was a
butcher house in the 1800s,

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.358 align:middle line:90%
then the mafia came in.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they've had a
lot of bizarre things happen.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.694 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: There's a lot
of layers of activity.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:47.529 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever,
Susan, get to a point

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.824 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't think the
other side ever existed?

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:54.036 align:middle line:84%
That there was this
emptiness, a void?

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.747 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I get that
way sometimes, even now.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.165 align:middle line:90%
You know, you lose your faith.

00:15:58.165 --> 00:15:58.957 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You doubt.

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.793 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, you
have your bad days

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:03.379 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh, you
know, that's silly.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.632 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just you're
here and you're gone,

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.926 align:middle line:84%
and it makes life more
depressing, because--

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.386 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a
theory about that

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:13.806 align:middle line:84%
and that is, if it does
exist, you'll know about it

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.307 align:middle line:90%
when you pass on.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't exist, you
won't and it doesn't matter.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.813 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: You won't care.

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.316 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like the
moment of going to sleep.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:28.904 align:middle line:84%
You really have lost
consciousness, basically,

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.739 align:middle line:90%
when you fall asleep.

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:33.075 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
you could be dead.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:33.701 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Sure.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:37.454 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, waking up
is this resurrection.

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:40.082 align:middle line:90%
It's maybe life after death.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.458 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're alive again.

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:44.294 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to go, but
if you died like right

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:47.256 align:middle line:84%
at that moment of sleep,
that's the way it is.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.174 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just done for you.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.718 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I think so.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:54.596 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, too, that
a lot of people when they pass,

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:57.099 align:middle line:84%
they see people right before
and start talking to people.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.351 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A loved one shows
up, or something like that.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.729 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: It seems like
there's always somebody there,

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.688 align:middle line:90%
that you're not alone.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.691 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has this been a
dramatic change for you,

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
in terms of believing
and investigating?

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.112 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh, yeah.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.406 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I'm more
conscious of, you know,

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
how you treat other people,
and what you do with your life.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a nicer person?

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.538 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I think I am.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:23.459 align:middle line:84%
I care a lot about people,
and I like to help people.

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't before?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, I think I
was pretty nice before.

00:17:27.378 --> 00:17:27.963 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:30.215 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:33.051 align:middle line:90%
What do you think this all is?

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.888 align:middle line:90%
What is the other side?

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:36.764 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh my gosh.

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.392 align:middle line:84%
I think the other side
is you're more of a--

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:43.604 align:middle line:84%
I described this
actually to a boy who

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:47.566 align:middle line:84%
I met when I was
writing my AC/DC book.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:51.195 align:middle line:84%
I actually met a boy that
was dying of bone cancer.

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:54.239 align:middle line:90%
He was 15 years old named Cody.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.283 align:middle line:84%
Very life changing for
me because I'd never

00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:90%
had this experience.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.121 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wanted to meet
Angus Young from AC/DC.

00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:02.247 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was his wish.

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:02.831 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of known as
the AC/DC lady where I live

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.004 align:middle line:90%
and, well, on Facebook now, too.

00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:12.132 align:middle line:84%
But someone contacted me
from Thursday's Child, which

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:17.679 align:middle line:84%
is like Make a Wish Foundation,
and I pulled a few strings

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.723 align:middle line:84%
anonymously, because
I didn't want the band

00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:22.851 align:middle line:84%
to think I was trying to
reach them for my book.

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:25.729 align:middle line:84%
But I went up to the
hospital one night with him

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.439 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
called me because there

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
had been a blizzard that night.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.027 align:middle line:84%
It was right before
Christmas, and they

00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:34.488 align:middle line:90%
said his mom can't get here.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Would you come up
and sit with him?

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.284 align:middle line:90%
And I was honored by that.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:44.081 align:middle line:84%
And I went up there and he
asked me, and he was dying,

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.167 align:middle line:90%
and a 15 year old boy asked me--

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:48.919 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he bed confined?

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:49.503 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and he didn't have
a lot of time left.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.469 align:middle line:84%
And I had to pretend
that he wasn't dying.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.345 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mom--

00:18:58.345 --> 00:18:59.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not easy to pretend.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.305 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Exactly.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:03.684 align:middle line:84%
I had to pretend that
he was going to be fine.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.978 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me, he
said, what do you

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
think is going to happen
to me after I die?

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.442 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
I tell people this,

00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:13.986 align:middle line:90%
and this is the truth.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It made him laugh.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.698 align:middle line:84%
I said, I tell people
that after I pass,

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:20.284 align:middle line:84%
I'm going right
back to 1960 Hamburg

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:22.536 align:middle line:84%
and getting drunk
with John Lennon.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.663 align:middle line:90%
So that's my first thing to do.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.706 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of giggled.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.041 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you think
you can do that?

00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.002 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
don't know why not.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.672 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, I said, once
you leave your physical body,

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:37.217 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be like a
radio signal, so try to be,

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:38.468 align:middle line:90%
even though I know that--

00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:39.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'll be a beacon.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know it's
going to be scary.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:47.019 align:middle line:84%
I know it-- I don't
mean any disrespect

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.229 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not in your place.

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.648 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I think that you're
going to be like a signal,

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:53.525 align:middle line:90%
like a radio signal.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:56.945 align:middle line:84%
So what you put out, you're
going to attract to you.

00:19:56.945 --> 00:20:00.699 align:middle line:84%
So he told me that
his father actually

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.869 align:middle line:84%
had passed about
four years earlier.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.996 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
do you ever see him,

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.457 align:middle line:84%
and then he kind of looked
at me like, you know.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:09.958 align:middle line:90%
I said, I mean in your dreams.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.084 align:middle line:90%
Does he ever come to you?

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:14.254 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah, I've
seen my dad in my dreams.

00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:18.508 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I think your
dad will be there to greet you.

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:20.469 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and said, you think so?

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
why wouldn't he be?

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.306 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's your dad.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:24.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.475 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He'll
be there for you.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was so sad, but
so sweet, in a way.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.566 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't travel
to meet Angus,

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:37.736 align:middle line:84%
and by the time that I got the
call that they didn't think

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.364 align:middle line:84%
he was going to
last much longer,

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.658 align:middle line:90%
I made another phone call.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.202 align:middle line:84%
And Angus, who lives
usually in Holland

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:48.705 align:middle line:84%
with his wife, who is from
Holland, he called Cody--

00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:49.581 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.667 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And Cody
couldn't speak anymore.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.918 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He could just listen?

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He was--
yeah, he was on oxygen--

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:55.921 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he knew.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:56.922 align:middle line:90%
He knew it was him?

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.548 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, Angus
was on the phone.

00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:01.343 align:middle line:84%
He talked to Angus and
Angus talked to his mother,

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:05.097 align:middle line:84%
and he died within 24
hours after the phone call.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.848 align:middle line:84%
And they called
me later, and they

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
said we think that
you should know this.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.146 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- well,
you know about Cody,

00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:16.108 align:middle line:84%
the last day of his life,
because he told everybody

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.693 align:middle line:84%
about you and what
you had told him.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:21.321 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of made him
excited instead of--

00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Curious.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.864 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:25.534 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe there's
something that I don't know

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.202 align:middle line:90%
and she seemed to know.

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:31.373 align:middle line:84%
So the day that he passed,
he insisted on being dressed

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
in all of his AC/DC gear,
his t-shirt, his jacket--

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.128 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was ready.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.421 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He was ready.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.841 align:middle line:84%
And he was on
oxygen and he hadn't

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:45.012 align:middle line:84%
spoken for like two weeks,
and all of a sudden,

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:48.515 align:middle line:84%
he ripped the mask off of
his face and said, "No, Dad,

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:49.016 align:middle line:90%
not yet.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:49.766 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready.

00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:50.892 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready."

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:54.271 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10 or 15 minutes
later, he just kind of relaxed

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.314 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "OK,
Dad, I'm ready.

00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:57.482 align:middle line:90%
Let's go."

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:58.066 align:middle line:90%
And he passed.

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And closed his
eyes, and that was it.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.653 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: That was it.

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.904 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sad for you?

00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.032 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh, very hard.

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.783 align:middle line:90%
Very hard for me.

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
He died much sooner
than I thought

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.998 align:middle line:84%
he was going to, actually
on New Year's Eve day,

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.875 align:middle line:90%
and it hit me pretty hard.

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:19.046 align:middle line:84%
And he's in the dedication to
the book "Let There Be Rock,"

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:21.882 align:middle line:84%
so now his name is
all over the world.

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:25.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There doesn't seem
to be justification for that.

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.219 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Not at that age.

00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.304 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: No.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.973 align:middle line:84%
It was very hard,
but I was honored.

00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I was honored that
he turned to me

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.311 align:middle line:84%
and that Angus came
through, like I

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:37.439 align:middle line:90%
knew he would, and called him.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:40.192 align:middle line:84%
And then after he
passed, Angus actually

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:43.487 align:middle line:84%
sent a bunch of
signed memorabilia,

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.572 align:middle line:84%
and his mother took
that and my book

00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:50.619 align:middle line:84%
and made a shadowbox thing
for him in his honor.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would take
it that you're not

00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:53.789 align:middle line:90%
afraid of the other side?

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:54.498 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: No.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:55.916 align:middle line:90%
No, not at all.

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:56.917 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.169 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exactly planning
on it any time soon.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's what
I keep telling people.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.505 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in a rush.

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.839 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:06.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when it
happens, it happens.

00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:09.012 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I'm fascinated
with it because there's just

00:23:09.012 --> 00:23:13.892 align:middle line:84%
too much proof, or proof to me,
that there's something else.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:14.643 align:middle line:90%
There has to be.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:17.479 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you believe in God more?

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.355 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh yeah.

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:21.274 align:middle line:84%
And God's more like
an energy, you know,

00:23:21.274 --> 00:23:24.945 align:middle line:84%
instead of like a guy sitting
up there in a desk somewhere.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.823 align:middle line:84%
But just the energy
that-- of love,

00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:30.659 align:middle line:84%
because love is the
most powerful emotion

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.494 align:middle line:90%
that creates life.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.204 align:middle line:90%
Hate destroys it.

00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:37.749 align:middle line:84%
God, the devil, you
know, is the same entity.

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:40.293 align:middle line:84%
It's positive and negative and
everything in the universe,

00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:43.255 align:middle line:84%
you know, like Howard Bloom,
love listening to him.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's great.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.217 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, yeah, and
everything is-- everything,

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the atom is
positive and negative energy,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.431 align:middle line:84%
and if we didn't have one,
we couldn't have the other.

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:54.975 align:middle line:90%
So we wouldn't exist.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.061 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This boy,
prior to him dying,

00:23:58.061 --> 00:24:03.358 align:middle line:84%
did he have like longer
hair, but like curly, dark.

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.317 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah, he did.

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:06.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just saw him
sitting over your shoulder.

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Really?

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a very
weird-- yeah, I

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.323 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what this
kid would look like.

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.992 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He did have
long hair and they

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:14.494 align:middle line:90%
had to shave it for chemo.

00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:19.291 align:middle line:84%
And, if you want to know
the postscript to the story,

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.751 align:middle line:84%
the day that he
passed, I was going

00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:23.378 align:middle line:84%
to go out that night
on New Year's Eve.

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:29.134 align:middle line:84%
I ended up not going, but I
came home and my ex at the time,

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.887 align:middle line:84%
he sat me down and he said,
I have something to tell you.

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.014 align:middle line:84%
We got a call today
from Thursday's Child

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:36.141 align:middle line:90%
that Cody passed today.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:39.311 align:middle line:90%
And it was like somebody took--

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.812 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
actually wearing

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.356 align:middle line:90%
a white t-shirt and white pants.

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:45.525 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know why he
would be wearing that.

00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:47.527 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He was
in the hospital.

00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
He had a gown on in
the hospital like that.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.868 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I found out that
he had passed, in my mind's

00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:58.663 align:middle line:84%
eye, a long haired
boy and his father

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.707 align:middle line:90%
walked through my living room.

00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:03.752 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear him in my
head going, "You were right.

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:04.377 align:middle line:90%
You were right.

00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly like
you said it is.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.507 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly like
you said it is."

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was really,
really excited.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.221 align:middle line:90%
So that gave me a lot of peace.

00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:14.804 align:middle line:90%
It really did.

00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:17.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like
when they cross over,

00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:22.187 align:middle line:84%
they don't really miss
this existence anymore.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:22.979 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: No.

00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:24.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We would,
because we're alive.

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:27.734 align:middle line:84%
There's things we have to
do, loved ones we have here,

00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:31.488 align:middle line:84%
but it's a different
feeling once they're gone.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah,
and it's amazing.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
think about this.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.494 align:middle line:84%
And I probably heard
it on your show,

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:43.291 align:middle line:84%
was that we lose one
person; they lose everybody.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:47.128 align:middle line:84%
So but they're not in
pain because it's a peace.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:51.299 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I wonder if Cody
has reincarnated already.

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He could have.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's the soul
of a little baby somewhere.

00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:58.139 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And listening to
AC/DC because he loved the band.

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:02.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure that
connection will stay there.

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And it is amazing.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.147 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Actually, when
the band went back out

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:09.567 align:middle line:84%
on tour in 2008, we
saw them in Chicago

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.528 align:middle line:90%
with my two girlfriends.

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:14.739 align:middle line:84%
And my son and I got to go
hang out with Angus and Malcolm

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.533 align:middle line:84%
and have a visit,
because I've known them.

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:17.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How is Malcolm?

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.326 align:middle line:90%
He's been sick, hasn't he?

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:19.577 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He's been sick, yes.

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:23.164 align:middle line:84%
And he's in hospital,
the last I heard,

00:26:23.164 --> 00:26:26.876 align:middle line:84%
and we hope that he's going to
get better, but we don't know.

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:90%
They haven't really confirmed.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:90%
He's not touring with the band.

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:35.677 align:middle line:84%
They plan on touring, and I'm
praying for him every day.

00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:39.139 align:middle line:84%
But the night that we saw
them at the All-State arena

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago, my girlfriends took
pictures of the tour buses,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.688 align:middle line:84%
and one of the tour
buses had a kid's face

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:50.358 align:middle line:84%
in the window that
looked like Cody.

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.777 align:middle line:90%
And it's in the photograph.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
very interesting.

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I bet it's the
same kid I just saw

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.073 align:middle line:90%
standing over your shoulder.

00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:57.699 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:58.658 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:58.658 --> 00:27:01.453 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he's around
me because I-- now he's

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:05.707 align:middle line:84%
in a book that's in 11
languages, so he's famous.

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:07.417 align:middle line:90%
He's part of the AC/DC history.

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:09.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The magic
of the other side.

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:11.171 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:15.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you tell
people who don't believe?

00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:18.386 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, my
goodness, I think life

00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:21.514 align:middle line:84%
is so much more
fascinating if you do.

00:27:21.514 --> 00:27:24.559 align:middle line:84%
I think that it makes
life so one dimensional

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:28.688 align:middle line:84%
and kind of depressing that--
not that this isn't great,

00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:30.523 align:middle line:90%
but, I mean, that this is it?

00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:32.233 align:middle line:90%
There's so much more.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:33.651 align:middle line:84%
I think that if
you don't believe,

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
start reading a
little bit, start

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.447 align:middle line:90%
investigating a little bit.

00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:41.993 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many books
and, like your show, and so

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.579 align:middle line:84%
many people out there that
know way more than I do.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.664 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I
said, with my book,

00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:50.377 align:middle line:84%
my book is like a
primer on how-to.

00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:52.295 align:middle line:90%
If you want to kind of indulge.

00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:55.048 align:middle line:84%
I don't say that I'm
an expert on any of it.

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:57.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The road map
through the other side.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.009 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:01.304 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fan, and I'm
just fascinated just

00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:90%
as much as anybody else.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.766 align:middle line:84%
So I say to look into
it, because everybody's

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.059 align:middle line:90%
got a story.

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.602 align:middle line:84%
When you start
talking to people,

00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:08.853 align:middle line:90%
everybody's got a ghost story.

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:09.854 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course they do.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.647 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: You know?

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.316 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, when you start
talking about it to people

00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:15.527 align:middle line:84%
that you think don't believe,
and they're like, well,

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:18.154 align:middle line:84%
you know that I did have
something happen to me once.

00:28:18.154 --> 00:28:21.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
have a demonic story?

00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:22.909 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I've had
dreams like that.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:25.036 align:middle line:84%
I've had dreams where I
was really glad that--

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:26.371 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like nightmares.

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:26.996 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
That I got out, you
know, that I woke up

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.877 align:middle line:90%
and it was just a dream.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Susan, with us.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Susan, do you have a website
that people can track you?

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:37.924 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:28:37.924 --> 00:28:39.342 align:middle line:90%
SusanMasino.com.

00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:40.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: M-A-S-I-N-O?

00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:41.219 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I'm on Facebook, and
all my books are on Amazon.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of the social media

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.852 align:middle line:84%
now with passing
information along?

00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:49.936 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it amazing?

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:51.438 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: It's incredible.

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.441 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially when-- like,
I just wrote a new book that

00:28:54.441 --> 00:28:58.027 align:middle line:84%
will be out next spring
an AC/DC FAQ book,

00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:00.613 align:middle line:84%
and I get information
from all over the world--

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:02.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This group
must love you.

00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.575 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well,
there's a family,

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:06.077 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they call
it the AC/DC family,

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:08.079 align:middle line:84%
and there's millions of
people around the world,

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:11.624 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as the slightest
bit of information comes out,

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:12.500 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.251 align:middle line:90%
They send it out.

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.378 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Favorite AC/DC song?

00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:17.255 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: "Let There Be Rock."

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:17.922 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:18.756 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The best?

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:20.175 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Absolutely.

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:21.551 align:middle line:90%
Very old '50s.

00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:22.802 align:middle line:90%
It's got a good swing to it.

00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:27.223 align:middle line:84%
You know, they love Chuck Berry
and Muddy Waters and John Lee

00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:31.102 align:middle line:84%
Hooker and, you know, they're
a good blues based, very

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:34.564 align:middle line:84%
simple band that has
made millions playing,

00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.399 align:middle line:84%
like they say, the
same three chords.

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.942 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:41.529 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what Billy
Gibbons says from ZZ Top.

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.698 align:middle line:84%
Same chords and they just
keep going all the way.

00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:44.657 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: That's right.

00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:46.117 align:middle line:84%
You just change them
around a little bit.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had seen
them in Saint Louis,

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:54.125 align:middle line:84%
and the next day Dusty Hill fell
on the bus and broke his hip.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:58.838 align:middle line:84%
He's doing much better now, too,
but those old classics, there's

00:29:58.838 --> 00:29:59.589 align:middle line:90%
something there.

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.381 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh, yeah.

00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when they
pass on, maybe they'll

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.427 align:middle line:84%
still be playing music
on the other side.

00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:05.512 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I bet they will.

00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.765 align:middle line:84%
I bet there's a heck of
a band on the other side.

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
can only imagine

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:13.645 align:middle line:84%
how many rock stars
are on the other side.

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:14.521 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Exactly.

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:15.438 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:15.438 --> 00:30:18.191 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My gosh, since
how far back do you go?

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:21.819 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh my god, all
the way to Robert Johnson.

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:25.615 align:middle line:84%
At the crossroads selling his
soul to the devil as they say.

00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:27.784 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:29.536 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating discussion
about the other side.

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you may or may not be
a believer in life after death,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.794 align:middle line:84%
but when you begin
to hear stories

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:43.091 align:middle line:84%
like this, her son Jamie and
Cody and episodes like that,

00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:44.926 align:middle line:84%
you really have to
stop for a moment

00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:48.054 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know what,
maybe it does exist.

00:30:48.054 --> 00:30:51.683 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is life after death.

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.476 align:middle line:90%
I'm a believer.

00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:56.563 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you on our next
edition of "Beyond Belief."
