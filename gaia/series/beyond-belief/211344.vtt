>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:10%
Vernon Mahabal is
with us, a palmist

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and the founder and director
of the Palmistry Institute.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
He has read thousands of hands
given hundreds of lectures

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:90%
on the ancient art of palmistry.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Vernon, welcome back
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VERNON MAHABAL: Thank you.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.333 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the palm.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
What is so important
about the palm that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
allows people like
you to give us

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:90%
an understanding of who we are?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: Palmistry,
George, is a brother

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:10%
or a sister to astrology.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:10%
So whatever an astrologer
can see on their charts

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:10%
on a computer, we
can see on the hand.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
We can see the positions of the
planets, the signs, the houses,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:10%
and many other
configurations that

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:10%
show a person's life destiny,
their purpose, their challenges

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:10%
also.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just by
looking at the palm.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, just
by looking at the hand.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if we look at
the segments of our fingers

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:90%
there's 12 of them.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And those 12 segments have
to do with the signs--

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Aries, Taurus, Gemini,
Cancer, Leo, Virgo.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So the fingers are in themselves
an astrological chart.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
the palm tell you

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
about the person's inner soul?

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It shows our
destiny, the talents

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that we bring into this
world, the challenges

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to face.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a GPS
basically of what

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:90%
we're here to do in our life.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It's our roadmap.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It's our personal roadmap.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It's our GPS system.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the palm
tell you about the soul,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.725 align:middle line:84%
or does the soul tell
you about the palm?

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
The soul is emanating these
lines, configurations,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
shape of the hands,
fingerprints into our hands.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the soul
within the core of the heart

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
is sending signals
constantly into the hands,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and then that's how
it is showing itself.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
The palm, the hand is the
visible part of the soul.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the soul,
but we can see the hands.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So the hands are the
visible part of the soul.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it take
you to learn how to read palms?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I started feeling
a bit confident after about

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:90%
7 years of doing it.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.078 align:middle line:90%
After about 7, 8 yeah.

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It took you 7 years
to get it under your belt?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: To feel a
sense of confidence.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who taught you?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I learned
from someone named

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Patrick Geoffrois in New York.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
I studied with him for 5 years.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I watched him give readings.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
He used to sit at a table on
St. Mark's Street in Manhattan

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:90%
and just give readings.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I used to watch
him for hours.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, after he would
look at somebody's hand,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
he would tell me what he
saw and how he got there.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
India many times,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and I studied with a
teacher for 15 years.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
So I learned--

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that's
pretty intensive for it.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, I just had a--

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I just had this craving
for wanting to learn hands.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the palm tell
you if you were an old soul?

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, it does.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And in my interpretation
of an old soul

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is that a person has had
many lives as a human being.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And a younger soul
would be someone

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
who hasn't had that many lives
in the human form of life.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So an old soul would be
someone who is searching more.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They're asking more
questions of who am I?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
What's my-- what's
the purpose of life?

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
That's my interpretation
looking at a hand

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:90%
of what is an old soul.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
we're all eternal.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The palms absolutely 100%
show that we are eternal,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:90%
and we're not this body.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
We're spiritual soul, and
the body is just a dress,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
and we're just in the body
for a short period of time,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and the next life is a continuum
of what we did in this life,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%
but we're eternal.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's no such
things, in my opinion,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
as an old or a young soul.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
We're all eternal.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
We've been in this material
world since time immemorial.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But the old soul
shows, in my opinion,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that someone has
been on a search

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
for meaning what is
the purpose of life.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In
reincarnation, Vernon,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
does the palm stay the same
for every reincarnated life?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: No, because we
change our desires as we

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
go from one body to another.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So someone may, in one
life, become an architect,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and in their next
life, they might

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
want to do more interior
design or decorum.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:90%
So that'll show in the hand.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The hands are constantly
changing from one life

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to another, but there
are similarities

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:90%
from one hand from another.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our
producers at Gaia,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:90%
his name-- her name is Julia.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And you did a reading on her
and talked about past lives,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what
you came up with.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:84%
- I'll tell you about your
continuum in this life,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
what you wanted to do from the
previous life of creativity

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and what you were not
able to accomplish.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So for that, we have to
look at what's called

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:90%
the middle transverse line.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And that line starts
here and ends up here.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And this line has to do
mostly with how we think

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and what we think about.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The upper transverse
line is what's commonly

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:84%
called the heart
line, and New Agers

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:90%
would call it the heart chakra.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this would be
called the seventh chakra

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
because the seventh
chakra has everything

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to do with the knowledge
we've inculcated

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
from previous lives
and our wisdom

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and in it to a certain extent
our emotional intelligence.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So your line starts straight
for about two-thirds

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
and then dips into the moon.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the moon is the repository
of creativity, imagination,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
our dream dimension, what
our creative juices were--

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:90%
want us to accomplish.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So because 2/3 of this line
has to do with logic and reason

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and analyzation,
and calculation,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
it means that your particular
perspective of creativity

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and art had to do with
directing other people

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and delegating other people
and being the glue that

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
holds a project
together, but you

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
did feel according to
your hand that you did not

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
go far enough in being able
to bring out your own ideas,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:90%
your own conceptual creativity.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
- So we know that because it's
not descending into the moon

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
as much as it wants
to, but we do--

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
we can see from the hand
that it is trying to descend.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to get there.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It wants to go there.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So it means that in
this life, you still

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
will be a director
delegator, and you will tell,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
hey, John, do this.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Susie, do that.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
This company is going
to come in and do this.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It does show that, but it
also shows at the same time

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to want to
have more of a decided idea of,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:84%
hey, I want to bring my creative
ideas into this project,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
you see, more and
more in this life.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what you
told her was pretty astute.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you pick that
up from just a palm?

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The lines and
the different configurations

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
on the hand show
planetary influences,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and you combine them
with the psychology

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional qualities
that are beneath these signs.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
entire configurations,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and you are able to see
one's accomplishments

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
from the previous life,
what someone wants to do,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and then how they're
going to accomplish it

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in more of, let's say, an
emotional or psychological way.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:90%
That's how we look at it.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, what is, in
your opinion, a soul mate?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: A soul mate
is going to be generally

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
a relationship, an intimate
relationship that's

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
going to stay with a person
maybe two or three lifetimes.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I've seen as many as seven,
but no more than that.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's
likened to the fact

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that we are all soul mates.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
We're all sons and
daughters of God.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:90%
We're all related.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's like
sometimes on the sea,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:90%
it'll bring straws together.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
A wave will bring a
bunch of straws together,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and those two straws
will stay for a while,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and then another wave
will break them apart.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly
throughout our lifetimes

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
associating with people, staying
with some people for a while

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
intimately and then
finding new people.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think,
George, that there's

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
a soul mate that will stay
with us lifetime after lifetime

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.185 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime
hundreds of lifetimes.

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen that.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people make the mistake

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that they think they
have one soul mate,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and if something happens,
they're in panic mode,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, my God, my
soul mate is gone.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.557 align:middle line:84%
Like you just said,
you can have many.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's
not-- yeah, exactly.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I see in hands.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I've seen as many as, let's
say, three or four lifetimes

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:90%
people can be together.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And the longest I've seen is 7.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
After that, we pick
up new soul mates.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the palms
match each other

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:90%
from person 1 and person 2?

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: No.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: We're
all individuals.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the interesting
thing about relationship

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
compatibility is that
we're all different.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And the best compatibilities
in relationships

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
are where people give the
other person what they require

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:90%
rather than what we require.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
In relationships, we tend to
give to the other person what

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
we want, but the
best compatibilities

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
are when we're able to know
what the other person's like

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and we give them what they need.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's my job as a palmist
to let the other person

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
know what the other person needs
and requires in a relationship.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
see compatibility

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:84%
when you read two different
palms in two different people?

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, you do.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You will definitely see
compatibility, especially

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
one thing I see a lot is people
will have the same interests.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's a requirement
that people have the same--

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
they like the same
music, or they

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:90%
like to do the same things.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
They think around
the same lines.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
That's important, but there
has to be some compatibility.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, people
won't stay together.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a karmic
factor too because sometimes we

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
see that two people may stay in
a relationship for a few weeks

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and one argument
will break them up,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and other times
we see people will

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
be in a relationship
for months and months

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're constantly
locking horns with each other,

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and that just means
they're reviving

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:90%
their previous relationship.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.875 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how much they fight.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why do sometimes
relationships end badly?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Because it's--

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:84%
George, it's time
for them to end.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It's time for each
individual person

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to find themselves in a new
light with a new person.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
That relationship, if you
will, comes to an end.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for
them to move forward.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen
a palm that was just

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmingly powerful?

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You see that with
people who are, let's say,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
the Steve Jobs of this society.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You see that with
musicians or artists

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.595 align:middle line:84%
who go beyond their
karma, if you will.

00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Successful people?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
You see that the
lines are very deep.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
You see that the hands are very
expressive when people talk.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
When people talk, and
their hands are just

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
very expressive and
very alive, that's

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
a person who is accomplishing
a lot in their life.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
interesting to see.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were able
to look at these palms

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
when they were babies,
could you pinpoint what

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:90%
their future would be like?

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely, George.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You can look at a six-year-old
and be able to know, oh,

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.633 align:middle line:84%
she is going to become an opera
singer, or he's going to--

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --You can
determine that?

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.967 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the hand.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's our destiny.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:90%
We have a destiny.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We also have the free will
to either do it or not

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
do it or even do it
in an overwhelming way

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond our
karma, if you will.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we have
desires and interests

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
from the previous life which
will carry over into this life.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So if someone was a singer
in their previous life

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to make
it more of a career,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.705 align:middle line:90%
they'll do it in the next life.

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
some indicators

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.742 align:middle line:90%
of a successful palm?

00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: One of
the indicators is

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that people use their hands
a lot when they speak.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That shows a person
who's jazzed up

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and enthusiastic about
whatever they do.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like this and that.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, kind of
being Italian a little bit.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: When you look at
someone who is successful

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:84%
or they're passionate
about their career,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:84%
one doesn't even have to
know anything about palmistry

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
itself, but you could just
look at someone's lines,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and the lines tend to be deep.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be rich.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Someone who hasn't really found
their destiny or their calling

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and is kind of
confused about what

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
they should be doing
in life, the lines

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:84%
themselves will
be kind of light.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
They will kind of look like
they could fall off the hand.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So expressive lines
talk about someone who's

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:90%
very expressive in their life.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Lines that are
very weak and short

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
show that someone hasn't
found their calling yet.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can determine that?

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
warn that person?

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you got a problem.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:90%
You better go down this path.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: My job
as a palmist is

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to realign the person with
this is your life calling,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're destined to
do, or this is your life work.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That's my job as a
palmist to help someone

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
to find their calling and
continue on with what they were

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
doing in their previous
life, what they loved

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
to do in their
previous life, and what

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:90%
their true desires are.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And the main problem that
I see with this-- and I'm

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
being very honest here.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
90% of the people
that I read for

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
are not doing
their life calling.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not in
the right slot, right?

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.385 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And I think that
really affects our society.

00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Most of my clients are kind
of or just people in general

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.577 align:middle line:84%
are not doing the work
that they're born to do.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
back to our readings

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
with Julia, the
producer, again and see

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:90%
what else you had to tell her.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
- So how a person
holds their thumb

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is the indicator of how much
you feel you're moving forward

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.937 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do
an exercise with you.

00:15:30.937 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do the exercise.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Go like this with your hands.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And then put them down
on the table like that.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have a 45-degree
angle between the beginning

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
part of this part and
where the thumb is.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So 90 degrees
would be like this.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And if the thumb hangs in
or even touches the skin,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole other animal.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So the thumb is the
indicator of human willpower

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, when
people say thumbs up,

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
they mean, hey,
I'm going to get.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get it.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:90%
- What's 45?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
- So the 45 degrees is
both the middle ground.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
You're balanced.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's a
healthy sense of confidence,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:90%
but there's not arrogance.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It's an indicator of
having a mentality

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
of being able to yield
to people when needed.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
You can be cautious
and careful but not--

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:90%
you're not overcautious.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not afraid to say, well,
I don't want to go that far.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, so sure.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
- But at the same time,
you're not so confident

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
that you'll say no.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.913 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:39.913 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
- I'm not going
to do this at all.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:90%
- Like domineering.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:90%
- Exactly.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a healthy indicator
of both caution and impulse.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You see, because people who are
like this are very impulsive.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They listen to that
inner voice all the time.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They trust their inner
heart all the time,

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and they're very intuitive.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're psychic,
but they do trust themselves,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
whereas people who keep their
palms a little bit too close

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.789 align:middle line:84%
to each other-- the palm have
no confidence in themselves.

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%
There's no faith.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
So this shows a healthy
faith in yourself

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.655 align:middle line:84%
and a healthy confidence
but not overconfidence.

00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:90%
So this just shows--

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the 45-degree angle will show
in its-- just in itself success

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
because you know how
to work with people,

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
you can get your place in the
world, and at the same time,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you have the confidence to make
things happen in the world.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, does the
palm change at all from birth

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to adulthood, or
does it stay the same

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:90%
from the moment you're born?

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Lines
generally don't change.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
They may add a certain
branch or a different--

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
they may get deeper or
lighter, but the lines

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and/or our configurations
don't change because they

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.405 align:middle line:84%
show what we did in
our previous life

00:17:59.405 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and what we're here
to do in this life.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you're born,
they are what they are now.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, and it
does show on the hand,

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:90%
if we're accomplishing that.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
explanation for exercises?

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you exercise your
own hands and try

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to pinpoint if we're going
to be successful or not?

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that a person can

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
do to become successful
and feel more confident

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
is when they're doing
their job, or they're

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
doing things they need to do,
and they need some guidance,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
hold the hands together,
hold the palms together.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that?

00:18:38.345 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Like that.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a prayer?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.922 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Like a prayer.

00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you can just
hold the fingers together,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
or you can clasp them
together, and what this does

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is the right hand deals with
the left brain and vice versa.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
this type of mode,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing
both the thinking

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
of both the right and
the left brain together,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's a symmetry.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.475 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes if a person
really wants to move forward

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're thinking,
should I do this today,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or should I do that
tomorrow, and they bring

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the hands together,
sometimes just contemplating,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
they'll get the right
answer because they're

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:90%
harmonizing both brains.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
powerful exercise.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you may even
do it unconsciously.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking, should
I go to this store today,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
or should I go to
this store tomorrow?

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
unconsciously doing that,

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll get the answer.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have two work at it?

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it difficult?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.172 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: If you're
conscious of it,

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:90%
it'll be even more powerful.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Another exercise I
tell people to do

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
is if you're in a state
of indecision or confusion

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
or uncertainty, or you're
just doubting yourself,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and you want some
intuition, or you

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
want some inspiration
take your left hand

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and just hold it close
to your heart like this

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and just think for
a minute or two.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.317 align:middle line:84%
And then your second-guessing
of yourself will leave,

00:19:59.317 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get an answer
because what you're doing

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is you're taking
the left hand, which

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
is ruled by the right
brain, and the right brain

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do with
intuition and inspiration.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the subconsciousness,
and you're

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
putting it on the heart, which
is the repository of the soul.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's
very, very powerful.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is in a state
of confusion or uncertainty

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or they just want
an answer, just

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:90%
hold your hand to your heart.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can even
take the right hand--

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you can feel
the beat too obviously.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.487 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:33.487 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Why are some people destined
for success and other people

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:90%
aren't?

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.312 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Because
in a previous life

00:20:38.312 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:90%
a person was pious, if you will.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people ask me,
for instance, all the time,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:90%
am I going to win the lottery?

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
If they're at a party-- if
I'm at a party, hey, Vernon,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:90%
am I going to win the lottery?

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not arbitrary.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
winning the lottery

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
means that, in a previous life,
a person did good activities.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they gave
money to charity,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe they opened a hospital,
maybe they planted trees.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:90%
They did good.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So in the next life, the state
or the province, if you will,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:90%
pays them back.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is,
let's say, born

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
with a silver spoon
in their mouth

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
or they have great
parents, loving parents,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:84%
they have a nice beautiful
body, they're educated well,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
good consciousness,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
it means in their previous
life they did good activities.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
They were good to other people.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They tried to move
forward in their life

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:90%
and advance their consciousness.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So the next life is
a continuum of that.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
They're rewarded.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: So we get in
this life what we deserve

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and what we desire.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So if a person, let's
say, goes through,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
even from beginning birth,
very challenging parents,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
challenging circumstances,
challenging neighborhoods,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that type of thing,
challenging people,

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
it means that they
are interfacing

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
with the same energies that
they gave back, if you will,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:90%
from a previous life.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So in that way,
that will help them

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to become more
introspective and reflective

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and maybe purify their life
and become better people.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever read
a palm and it didn't turn out

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the way it should
have been that person's

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
life or his lifestyle
or something,

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
where the palm says this
guy's going to be successful

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:90%
and he never was?

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Many
times, you can see

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
where someone will become
successful or fulfilled

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
in a particular area, not just
career-wise but in a hobby.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:90%
They may not fulfill it.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:10%
So my job, if you
will, as a palmist,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:10%
is to really champion someone
to awaken the giant within so

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:10%
that they do it.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:90%
We do have free will.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a destiny, but that
destiny is not arbitrary.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
We wanted that from
our previous life.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Whatever desires or talents
we have in this life,

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
we endeavored in a previous
life to do that very thing,

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time,
we have a free will

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accomplish
it or not accomplish it.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So I try to champion
people to do it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they do it, money
will come, success will come,

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:90%
fulfillment will come.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%

Generation X, Generation Y,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%

Do you see similarities
in people's palms

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:90%
from their generation?

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:90%
For instance--

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm a Baby Boomer.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, in your generation,
what I have seen

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:84%
is that America used
to be that place

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:90%
of the rugged individualism.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
That was the thinking
of your generation--

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:90%
rugged individualism.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.170 align:middle line:84%
The millennials, by
way of comparison,

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:90%
are completely opposite.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The 1980 to 94.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The 1980s
to 1984, they--

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '94.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
this generation that

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.985 align:middle line:84%
wants to do things in a
group, do things in a team.

00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
see similarities

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:90%
there with their palms?

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Quite a lot.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Quite a lot.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the generation,
for instance, the millennials.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
They just love working with
cell phones and computers,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that type of stuff.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.923 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about it.

00:24:22.923 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: They are destined
for working in that industry

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:84%
or just they understand
it intuitively.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got to teach
millennials what radios are.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in their phone.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: So many times.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll give my phone to my
son, and I'll say, hey,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.540 align:middle line:90%
can you get this going for me.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:90%
He said come on, dad.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I said no, I can't.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he can.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: He can
do it in a second.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes me 10 minutes
to argue with him

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to get him to do it when
he could be doing it,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and it will be
done in one minute.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But that generation has the
mindset from previous lives

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that
type of technology.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They were in a particular
place in our universe

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
where they dealt with technology
and that type of energy.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So they're born at this
time, and they work well

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:90%
with that energy.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
God given, Vernon?

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Is God giving us these
palms on purpose?

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: We have
a desire to fulfill,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think God
fulfills our desires.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Man proposes and God disposes.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe
that our talents are

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
coming from the Supreme Lord.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely do believe that.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's our desire
what we want from God.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that we are forced

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to do a particular career,
destiny, or life purpose.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
desired to do it,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and then God gives us the
power and the intelligence

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:90%
to carry it out.

that music generation.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:90%
They are very organized people.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
They're very good at organizing
things, planning things,

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
structuring things,
arranging things

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:90%

didn't have the same qualities
as being able to plan

and organize and
structure things as much

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:90%

A desire-- and that's
a generational thing,

if you will.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
being a millennial,

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
if you're reading
three hands a day

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.868 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing that
for years and years--

00:28:46.868 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a lot for you?

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: That's about normal.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I like to do about
three readings a day.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.435 align:middle line:90%
And that's about enough.

00:28:55.435 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.967 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, but
you can see trends?

00:28:57.967 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You can see--
you can see trends.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You can see financial trends.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
You can see trends in business.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You can see even trends
where people are moving.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's say up until
about 5, 6 years ago,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
the two biggest
questions were, am I

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be in a relationship?

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.537 align:middle line:90%
Or relationship questions--

00:29:17.537 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And my job.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: And my job.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Now the last 3 and
1/2 years, 4 years,

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
five years, especially now,
everybody wants to know

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
where should I move,
what is-- where

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
does my hand say I
will be successful,

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
or doors will open for me?

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So now I just see
mass migrations

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of people in the United States.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big deal.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And you never used to see
that 10 years, 15 years ago.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an old song
called Hands Across America,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It was done in the '70s where
people get together and hold

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
hands across America for
unity and sovereignty.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
That sounds a little
bit about what you do,

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
unity and sovereignty,
trying to make sure

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:90%
that everybody coexists.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I think
that's an ideal,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a
vision, and I think

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
it's something that could
also be practical reality.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I see myself as a visionary but
as a very practical visionary.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, what
I would like to see.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see a United
States of America again.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you tell through
palms if 10 years or 15 years

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:84%
are going to be successful
for a person or a country?

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Even in the most
successful people, George,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I will see ups and downs.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.715 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you will see someone--

00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the palm.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.548 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: In the palm.

00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
For instance, someone may run
a business for 10, 20 years,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and they'll open
up a side business,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and it will just sink,
or maybe the business

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing,
which has been

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
very successful for
many, many years

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
will have struggles
and obstacles.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.818 align:middle line:84%
So it's very common
to see people

00:31:06.818 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:90%
go through their ups and downs.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, those
downs could actually

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:84%
make a person even
more successful

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.290 align:middle line:90%
because they learn from it.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would hope
to see in a person's hands.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to look
at the hands of Elon Musk,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
very successful, world's
richest individual,

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
would you have seen when he
was deciding to buy Twitter,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
for example, for $44 billion--

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.233 align:middle line:90%
don't do it, don't do it?

00:31:31.233 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you see
something like that?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You'd be able to see
that if you had a strong enough

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:84%
magnifying glass and a
light at three years old

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that he would be in the
position that he is in now.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.840 align:middle line:90%
You would be able to see that.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You would be able to
see if a person is

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:90%
going to be a successful CEO.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You would be able to
see if a person will be

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:90%
a successful clothes designer.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It could be seen
at three years old.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Earlier, you talked
about the various indexes

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:90%
on fingers.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Do they all determine
different things?

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, they do.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:84%
For instance, just by
the length and the width

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of a particular
segment, we could

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
tell a lot about
a person, but I'll

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:84%
give you an interesting
exercise to look at.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
There are things on
the fingers that I

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
call verticals--
activation verticals.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
If you see a lot of lines
that are going up the fingers,

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.485 align:middle line:84%
it means a person is doing
what they're born to do--

00:32:30.485 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
like up the fingers--

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, up.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you see lines
that are cross lines.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
these are roadblocks,

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:41.165 align:middle line:84%
the horizontal lines
on these segments.

00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
where they are.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we just see lots and
lots of horizontal cross lines.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
That shows that
a person is going

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
through obstacles or
interferences, roadblocks,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:90%
that type of stuff.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So if I see a palm and I'm
looking at their fingers

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:84%
specifically, and I
see lots of lines--

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.040 align:middle line:90%
they can be very light.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be very deep.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:84%
They usually are very
light, but I see a lot

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of lines going up the fingers.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:84%
That shows that a person is
in their right line of work,

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.298 align:middle line:84%
they're successful, and they're
doing what their passion is.

00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:17.631 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're supposed to do.

00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Do the various fingers
determine different things?

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is my ring
finger tell you something

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:90%
that my index finger would?

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, and I
always tell a person to hold

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the fingers straight
up and down like this,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.937 align:middle line:84%
and then kind of look
at them, the palms--

00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Spock?

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Like that.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And if someone's index
finger is longer than

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the ring finger
that means a person

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
enjoys to be a
leader in this life.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:84%
At the very least,
they're quite independent,

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be very
individualistic,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and they want to have control
and influence over their life

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:90%
or their environment.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:84%
By the way of comparison, if
the ring finger is longer than

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:84%
the index finger, it means that
self-expression or creativity

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.929 align:middle line:84%
is more important than just
being independent or being

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:90%
financially solvent.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they're
about the same size?

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's
very, very rare,

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
and it means that a
person is probably

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:90%
running their own show.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
David Bowie had
that, for instance.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Someone like a David Bowie would
have a very long ring finger

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're in the world of
art and creativity and music.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
he ran his own show.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:90%
He was very independent.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the hands of,
let's say, an Ozzy Osbourne,

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:84%
for instance, his ring finger
would be very, very long,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.880 align:middle line:84%
but his Jupiter finger
might be his index finger

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
might be a little
bit shorter, you see,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:84%
because his wife
runs his business.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about thumbs?

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:90%
What do they tell you?

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The thumbs are the
indicator of the human will.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why animals don't
really have a developed thumb,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But if someone's thumb when
they're speaking with you,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.560 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
using their hands,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
the thumb is
outstretched like this,

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
it shows super, super
willpower, super confidence.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And by way of comparison
when the thumbs

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
go towards the palm, maybe
even touching the palm,

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
it shows a lack of confidence.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people
put your hands on the desk

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:90%
see how far that thumb is.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And if it's 45-degree
angle, it shows

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
a person is confident
but not overconfident.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But the thumbs are the indicator
of our drive and determination,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and a very interesting
exercise is this.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.213 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands together
like this quickly.

00:35:47.213 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Is your right thumb on
top of your left thumb,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
or your left thumb is
on top of your right?

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My left is
on top of my right.

00:35:52.225 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That means you
tend to be more intuitive when

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:90%
making decisions.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Though,
I'm right-handed.

00:35:56.987 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It doesn't matter.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: If your left thumb
is on top of your right thumb,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:84%
it means that when
you make a decision,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.680 align:middle line:84%
you trust your gut feelings,
you trust your instincts.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You go to the still
small voice within.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about the reverse?

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.038 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The
reverse is that when

00:36:12.038 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:84%
you try to make-- when
you make a decision,

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you go through the arena
of logic and reason.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the board of
directors in your brain.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So math teachers and logicians
always have their right thumb

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.520 align:middle line:90%
on top of their left thumb.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And artists and musicians
usually have their left thumb

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.908 align:middle line:90%
on top of their right thumb.

00:36:30.908 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the palm
of the left hand

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.303 align:middle line:84%
identical to the palm
of the right hand?

00:36:34.303 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: George,
completely different.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.053 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are, really?

00:36:37.053 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: --completely
different because the right

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
hand has to do with
the left brain,

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and this hand has everything
to do with how we get places

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:84%
our approach to the
life, how people see us.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I look to the right hand to see
a person's career, how they're

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
moving forward in life,
and their influence

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and impact on the world.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I look to the left
hand-- and this

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.780 align:middle line:90%
is the same for left-handers.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.337 align:middle line:84%
I look at the left hand to
see, hey, their relationships,

00:37:06.337 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:84%
how they're doing in their
personal relationships,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:90%
their domestic life.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the hand that talks
about their kids, their family

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
life, what kind of
hobbies they have.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So the hands are
completely different even

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
on the same person because
they talk about two completely

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.740 align:middle line:90%
different avenues of our life--

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:84%
our domestic life
and our career life.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By massaging
the hands, does

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:84%
that do anything to
the palms, the fingers

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.320 align:middle line:90%
in terms of whatever?

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely if
a person is feeling a lack

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.013 align:middle line:90%
of confidence in their career--

00:37:41.013 --> 00:37:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or depressed.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, if a person
is feeling depressed or sad

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:84%
in their job or
they just feel, hey,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to move forward,
take the index finger

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.308 align:middle line:84%
and just hold it with
your hand, the other hand.

00:37:53.308 --> 00:37:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter which--

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that do?

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: The index--

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pull my thumb.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a joke.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:03.320 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see that
movie, did you?

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The index finger like
when we point, we tell people,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:90%
make sure you get this done.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:84%
When we're pointing,
we're saying do this.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So the index finger
has everything

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:84%
to do with getting our
place in the world,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:90%
getting our way in the world.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.807 align:middle line:90%
No, you're right about that.

00:38:17.807 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:90%
People usually don't do that.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what-- if a
person feels, hey,

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to be more
successful in my career.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to get inspiration on how
to make this project work out

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.560 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Just take your left hand,
usually, and your right hand

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of massage
it or just hold it,

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:48.003 align:middle line:84%
and then a person will feel more
inspiration in their career.

00:38:48.003 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All through the hands?

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Another exercise I
tell people, and you

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:84%
might want to do this when
you're not around people.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want
to seek the way forward,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:07.277 align:middle line:84%
hold your index finger up to
the sky and just for a brief--

00:39:07.277 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you do that
outside, people will think

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:90%
you're a little--

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.198 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Or you
just caught the ball,

00:39:13.198 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:90%
and you're getting a touchdown.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.105 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:15.105 --> 00:39:16.022 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:39:16.022 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: But if you look at
ancient paintings of Egyptians,

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.250 align:middle line:84%
you'll see them holding
their fingers up,

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:90%
especially this index finger.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is that they're

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:84%
gaining-- they're trying
to get inspiration

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
from the gods and the
demigods and the goddesses,

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly realm, if you
will, to prosper in life.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did the
verbiage thumbs up come from?

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Again, the
thumb has everything

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to do with willpower and
drive, and one's determination.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
They say, for instance,
that self-realization

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:90%
is self-determination.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
British say thumbs up

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:90%
it means I'll get it done.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll make it happen.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So when the thumb is in
this upraised position,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:84%
it means that I'll
take care of it.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll handle it.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.937 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
the opposite would

00:40:07.937 --> 00:40:09.217 align:middle line:90%
be-- it's never going to work.

00:40:09.217 --> 00:40:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gave me a
reading the last time

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.383 align:middle line:90%
you were on the program, Vernon.

00:40:12.383 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a little
quick one here.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:84%
How close do we
need to get here?

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.957 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I could just look--

00:40:20.957 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell people
what you're looking

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:90%
at while you're doing that.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.709 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
thumbs, and I see

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
upraised joint here,

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to see
it on this hand too.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.267 align:middle line:84%
You see this, and I don't
have it much on my hand,

00:40:38.267 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:84%
but you see there's
like an upraised--

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
way I was born, right?

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, so
that shows that when

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.910 align:middle line:84%
you work with your
hands in any capacity,

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:84%
making something, fixing
something, repairing something,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:90%
you'll feel a sense of calm.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.475 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to
work with your hands.

00:40:56.475 --> 00:40:57.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
have a bump here?

00:40:57.975 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.467 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: People who have
a very, very upraised bump

00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:04.550 align:middle line:84%
will show that they actually
work with their hands

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:90%
as a lifestyle.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They may fix cars, they
may be an arborist,

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:90%
they may be an architect.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But when there's a very
readable upraised joint here,

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.810 align:middle line:84%
it means that someone can
work with their hands.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you work
with your hands,

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:84%
it also shows there's
another area here

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that it's hard to point
out, but I see it,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that when you're just
maybe writing with a pen,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:84%
or you're doing anything
with your hands--

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or computer work.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, computer work.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:90%
It actually calms you down.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:90%
It's very therapeutic.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.775 align:middle line:90%
It makes you feel good.

00:41:33.775 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.025 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's relaxing for
you to work with your hands.

00:41:37.025 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So even if you were to
grow something or cook--

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:84%
your hand also shows
cooking ability,

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's because this
segment, the very bottom joint

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.120 align:middle line:84%
or the very bottom segment
of your index finger,

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:90%
has to do with cooking.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at it, you'll see

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
it's the widest and the
longest of that finger.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So you probably
enjoy cooking also.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fun.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't cook a lot, but
it's fun when you do.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like chemistry.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: So I
would say cook a lot.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It would be a meditative
thing to cook.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're glad
you got into this field?

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I don't know
what else I would do.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you tell
people you read palms,

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:90%
what do they think?

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: George,
maybe 20 years ago,

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:90%
people would say what is that?

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you read
hands, you're a palmist?

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And now after, let's say,
especially after 2000

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and especially after
2012, people will say,

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.587 align:middle line:90%
oh, I want to get a reading.

00:42:32.587 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted--

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
wants readings.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
wants readings.

00:42:36.277 --> 00:42:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of readings,
do you give readings?

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: All the time.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I love giving readings--

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you?

00:42:41.807 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL:
palmistryinstitute.com.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: palmistryinstitute.com.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL:
palmistryinstitute.com.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You take
emails through that--

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:84%
My phone number is on there,
and my email is on there.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And you've been doing
this how long now?

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.407 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: Professionally
since 1986.

00:42:57.407 --> 00:42:58.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.270 align:middle line:10%
It's my passion, and my--

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:10%
I want to help other people
to understand their passion.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I want people to be
successful at what they do.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful job to
help people to know themselves

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.930 align:middle line:84%
because I think, George,
that's the goal of life to know

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%
oneself.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you see
something bad or derogatory,

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:84%
do you tell somebody so they can
change maybe or fix something?

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Depending on
what it is you have to,

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's why people
ask me for a reading.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't want me to
sugarcoat anything.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.410 align:middle line:84%
People will come to
someone in my line of work

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.410 align:middle line:84%
because maybe their
relationship isn't going well

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they're in
the wrong career path.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you
may have to say, hey,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
if you keep doing drugs, this is
going to be detrimental to you,

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:50.465 align:middle line:84%
or if you do this
nefarious activity,

00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:53.820 align:middle line:84%
it's going to destroy
what you've been doing.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.671 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell people so
that they realign themselves.

00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:02.285 align:middle line:84%
And people do want to
hear that information.

00:44:02.285 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Thank you, George.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
reading the palm can

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:84%
determine your future, who
you are, and who you may be.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.
