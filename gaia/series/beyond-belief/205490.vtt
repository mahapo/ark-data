all of this for people?

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I have worked
in the financial services

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:90%
business for 30 years.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:10%
And every time I
worked with people,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:10%
I noticed that they would
be telling me something

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
very practical about
money, and I was also

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:10%
feeling their energy.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And often that energy
was very fear oriented.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And it just caused me
to be super curious.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
What's going on under
the surface of somebody's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
relationship with money?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
somebody need a helper?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Great question.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because we don't
realize the fear that we're

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
holding on to.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places that
fear comes out is with money.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.987 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
hard to know, right?

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:40.195 align:middle line:84%
It's just like your hand
right in front of your face.

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.808 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: You can't see it.

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And until someone brings
it to your attention,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
you might not realize that
you're living a certain way,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
yet there's so much
more potential for you.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a phrase
called "scarcity mindset."

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.497 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
different for everybody.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The way I define it is a
zero-sum paradigm of life.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it's like we
treat life like it's a pie

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:90%
and there's eight pieces.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And once the pieces are gone,
then there's nothing left.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's this idea of
there's not enough.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
There's never enough.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I have found that not only
does that apply for the things

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.475 align:middle line:90%
that we--

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
money, and supplies, or
resources, or toilet paper,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
it also applies to how
we feel about ourselves

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.265 align:middle line:90%
not being enough.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we be balancing
this in order to have enough?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And maybe explain your question.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well let's say you chop
up this pie into eight pieces

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
like you just said and
all the pieces are gone.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
How do you do it and keep
a piece or two in reserve?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Well that's the funny
thing is that it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:90%
isn't as simple as that.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And probably it is helpful to
talk about just the research

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:90%
about scarcity.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just something
that we're making up.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot
of research that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
says that when we're living
with a scarcity mindset

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
or we feel like
there isn't enough,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
we actually have a loss in IQ of
up to 14 points in that moment.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So it literally causes
us to tunnel our vision.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So instead of thinking
about all the possibilities

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that are available
to us, we only

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
see a very small
portion of the options.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:90%
And so back to the pie.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We're treating life like a pie,
but in reality the potential

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:90%
is limitless.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:90%
There's always tons of options.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to
a financial advisor

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and they tell us that we don't
have enough money to retire,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:90%
we believe that.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.725 align:middle line:84%
And we shut down all
the other possibilities.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the problems that I

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
had working in the
business is I felt like we

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:90%
were telling people lies.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
We were telling them that
just because your money looks

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
one way today that's going
to be the rest of your life.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's simply not true.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's a
shocking not true,

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:03.055 align:middle line:90%
isn't it for a lot of people?

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Especially right now.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why retire
if you don't have to?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.075 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah,
great question.

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I plan to just keep
going until Tommy

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
comes back from a commercial
and says he's gone.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:90%
He's left us.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Why retire?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I agree.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine life--

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I love work.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I love making a
contribution and being

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:90%
in service of other people.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that retirement,
with some idea

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the financial
services came up with,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.905 align:middle line:84%
and we all just
said, OK, I guess

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're
supposed to do.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think it also
has to do with the fact

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of times,
people take jobs

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and they work in jobs for their
whole life that aren't jobs

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that they love.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And they can't wait
to get out of it.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%

people out there.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:10%
- Now the current standard
model, it's based on a story

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:10%
that you and I have been
steeped in from the time

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:10%
that we were born.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:10%
It's the story of
Western civilization.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:10%
It is a story based upon
separation, competition,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:10%
conflict, struggle, scarcity.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:10%
It's the sterile sounding
story of a dead universe,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:10%
of random mutations
that just happened

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:10%
as a result of just the
right conditions converging

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:10%
at just the right time
in just the right way,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:10%
requiring a series of events
that are so lucky that even

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:10%
scientists say it
takes an act of faith

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:10%
to believe the story
that we're being told.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well there's a new standard
model that's emerging.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:10%
Because the evidence, the
science-based evidence

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:10%
no longer supports
the scientific story,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:10%
the existing model.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:10%
In the new standard model,
it's a very different story.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:10%
It's the story of a
universe that is alive.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:10%
It's vibrant.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:10%
It's a story of a universe
where life is the rule rather

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:10%
than the rare exception.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:10%
It's a story that creates a
model based upon cooperation,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:10%
not competition, upon
abundance, not scarcity,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:10%
upon mutual aid and
self-empowerment

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:10%
through self-regulation.

You're learning about
your relationship

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:10%

only connects all things,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:10%
it's the field that
makes you who you are.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:10%
separate from the field.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:10%
It is within us.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:10%
It is emerging as us.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And because we are part of,
rather than separate from, we

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:10%
are given the ability
to self-regulate

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:10%
how we relate to this field.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And we've just seen that
we're wired to do this.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:10%
Our biology is actually
designed perfectly

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:10%
for specifically and exactly
this kind of self-regulation.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:10%
So the evidence that supports
these discoveries they're

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:10%
telling us a new human story.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:10%
And I have to tell you
it is a beautiful story.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:10%
It is a powerful story.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:10%
It's a story of hope.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a story of
possibility based

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:10%
in rock solid evidence
of the new science

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:10%
and the new discoveries.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now Leisa, Gregg's
always an upbeat kind of guy.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.085 align:middle line:84%
But he did drop the
scarcity word there.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:90%
What did you think of that?

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: He did.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I love what he's talking about.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I love just feeling into
the possibility of what

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:90%
we can create for ourselves.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what is
really resonating in the work

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that I do and what he's saying.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you teach people
to control their own destiny?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But I like to think of it as
being the creator of the life

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:90%
that they want to live.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I did not understand
that for much of my life.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought that you
worked really hard,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and you worked your way up.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And you followed the rules
to get to a certain place.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
that was creating.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
since come to see

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is that when we're playing
life by other people's rules,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
we're really not creating what's
going to make us most happy.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When events occur in
our lives, traumas, pandemics,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
wars, health issues,
people that we care about

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
die, how does that affect our
ability to form our future?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.673 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: When
we face challenges

00:08:40.673 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm hearing you say?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every day, every day.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Every day
we face challenges.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they're
presenting us with a choice.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to feel like a
victim to those challenges?

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to see those
challenges as opportunities

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
to grow and expand into
something more than just

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
being constantly given a
challenge after challenge

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:90%
after challenge?

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Because those challenges
don't ever go away.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It's what you're
going to do with them.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us
some examples of how

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
this scarcity mindset
has affected some people

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So scarcity leads
people to think that we

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:90%
need to compete for resources.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just recently,
what happened with toilet paper.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect example.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I should use that
word "poof," but it's gone.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was a great
example of scarcity mindset.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Once you found out that
toilet paper was all gone,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
us as human beings

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
is it's not just toilet paper.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we
start thinking, well,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
what about that?

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Like what about food?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
What about something
else that I need?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:90%
We kind of can't regulate.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Just what he was saying just
now was we lose the ability

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:90%
to self-regulate in the moment.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And we just think
the whole world

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is falling apart, because
there isn't any toilet paper.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.225 align:middle line:90%
It's like a snowball.

00:10:11.225 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps growing
and growing in our head.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would go to
the grocery store just

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to look at the empty
shelves because it

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
was fascinating for me
to see this, you know?

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm thinking
this scarcity mindset,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening?

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when I walked
through the store

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and look at the aisles and you
see these empty shelves where

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
paper goods are supposed
to be, they're just gone.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't know Leisa
was whether individuals

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
would buy five baskets full
or whether 500 people bought

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:90%
everything that was available.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.025 align:middle line:90%
I'm still not so sure.

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it might be?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think that
once toilet paper was

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
in scarce supply, people started
thinking about the things

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that they depended on
and they just started

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
buying as much as they could.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So then you started seeing the
signs that said you can only

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:90%
buy two of these, because--

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%
They had to restrict you.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, they had to.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Because again this scarcity
mindset had kicked in

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was dictating people's
purchasing decisions.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a
little bit about chakras.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:90%
What are chakras?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We've heard so many
things about Them

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, chakras
are energy vortices

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
that are of light.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And there's hundreds of them.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.973 align:middle line:84%
I focus on this seven
primary chakras--

00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:30.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That are in your body?

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, they're
in your body, essentially.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:90%
They're energy centers.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't see them
on an X-ray machine.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.117 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
they on your body?

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, so
they start at the root.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So at the
base of your spine.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the belly,
the solar plexus, the heart,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.052 align:middle line:84%
the lower throat, the
brow, and the crown.

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little points.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, energy points,
messaging centers, portals.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the same
for everybody, the spots?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Everyone has
them in the same center.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
do you manage them?

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with them?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So when you tune
in to the energy and you start

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to learn about where
they're located, the color--

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
they all have a
color associated--

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
they actually become
message centers.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So first you have to
become familiar with what

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%
are they going to say to you.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is telling
you about security and safety.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that has been
triggered by the toilet paper.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
The belly, the sacral chakra is
around feelings and creativity.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
The solar plexus, power.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:90%
The heart, love.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The throat, communication
and expression.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The brow is the integration
and the intuitive nature

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the crown is the
connection to the divine.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these things
that we can tap into?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:90%
How do you reach your chakra?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I teach people
how to do what you're saying.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's using
mindfulness techniques.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you were to
meditate on something.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So you meditate on
these centers and start

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to see them, see the light, see
the color, see the expression.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is
very Earth oriented.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:90%
The sacral is water oriented.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So you tune in to
these energy centers.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing about
having color and a property

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is it gives the mind
something to hold on to.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing
is as you start

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to learn the properties
of what they represent,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
they start to open up
portals of messages to us.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where everything
becomes very, very interesting,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:84%
because most of us don't realize
that these message centers have

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
been waiting to talk to us.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these research
centers physical or are they

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:90%
nonphysical?

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: They're nonphysical
in that they are kind of--

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've had people talk
about guides in the past years.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spirit guides.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Spirit guides.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So I think
that would be the easiest

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
way to sort of think about
how spirit guides communicate

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Some of us are very sensory.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
We can feel it in our body.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Some of us see things.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
When we close our
eyes, we see pictures.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of us hear things.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very auditory.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.898 align:middle line:84%
So I have clairaudient
is what they call that.

00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
hear 200 miles away.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, I
hear things and I'm

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:90%
guided through what I hear.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So for me when I tune
into the chakras,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I will most often
hear the messages

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:90%
that want to come through.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And what that
would look like is,

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
let's say, with the
root chakra and you're

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
checking in to this red,
spinning disk of light energy.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know it represents
safety and security.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I'll ask it.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Am I actually feeling
safe in the moment?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not, that voice
that comes, for me auditory,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
for other people different
ways, will say, no or yes.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:90%
You are or you aren't.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
that answer, you're

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
able to start to dive
in deeper to say, well,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
why am I so scared?

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about the
times that we're in right now,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a very helpful
question to ask yourself.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel so unsafe?

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can your
chakras make you ill

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
if you don't handle
them properly?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So I think
it's more like they're

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.947 align:middle line:84%
the message center telling
you that you have an issue.

00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That something's wrong.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't pay
attention to it,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I think, to me, from
what I've learned--

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'll use my mom's situation.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.153 align:middle line:84%
My mom passed away
from ovarian cancer.

00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: And this
is in the sacral area.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back
at my mom's life,

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I see a woman who was a
very feeling, centered

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
person who was constantly
denying her feelings.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And that is in the sacral area.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Someone who is like
the feelings are

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
so painful I don't
want to look at that.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.335 align:middle line:84%
And then she has ovarian cancer
that ultimately takes her life.

00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
happen to everybody?

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Do we all have this ability
to tap into these chakras

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and change our
physical situation?

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes, yes.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We all have the ability.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're saying
this with a great smile.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This makes you
happy or something.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I am because I
think we have a lot of questions

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have
the answers to them.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've found that every single
question, especially when we're

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
dealing with our body,
our health, our money,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
our scarcity
patterns, all of that

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
can be found inside of ourselves
by tuning into the chakras.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well when you talk
about the trauma, of course

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
on the Gaia program "Healing
Matrix," with Dr. Sue Morter,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
she talked with healer
Deborah King just about that.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:10%
- When trauma occurs, and it's
not dealt with in anything

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:10%
more than a survival response--

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.860 align:middle line:10%
because we're trying to--

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:10%
- Survive.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:10%
- --survive, get through it.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:10%
After that we get down the
road having survived this.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.047 align:middle line:10%
But maybe we haven't
really dealt with it.

00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:10%
We haven't really healed.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:10%
We haven't really
come to terms with it.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:10%
And in that situation,
what forms of expression

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:10%
do you see trauma showing
up inside of people

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:10%
when they haven't dealt with
it on a healing tone level?

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.522 align:middle line:10%
- Well the easiest one for
most people to grasp right off

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:10%
the bat is their heart.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:10%
Because we can really feel
when we close our heart

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.298 align:middle line:10%
we know we have.

00:17:49.298 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:10%
We're like you know what?

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.465 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to feel that.

00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm never going to acknowledge
that my partner did

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:10%
that to me, betrayed me
in that way, or my mother.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:10%
It could be anyone.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:10%
And we literally
close the chakra down,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:10%
which does not
allow any interplay.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.943 align:middle line:10%
Now if you look at
your base chakra

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:10%
and compare that--
that's the one that's

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:10%
at the base of your spine.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:10%
You're sitting on it right now.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:10%
And typical trauma there
would be an accident.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:10%
You're driving along
and suddenly you're

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:10%
either in an accident or
you witnessed an accident,

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:10%
either one can do it.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:10%
You can either can
even witness something

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:10%
on television that's
terribly upsetting.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:10%
The whole nation's base chakra
was in upheaval at 9/11.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And we all watched that
on television for days.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:10%
And you can feel
your base chakra

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:10%
when it goes out of whack
because you pull it up.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately, we
disconnect from the earth

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:10%
which is the thing
that's keeping us safe.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:10%
So now we feel less safe because
we've just cranked our base

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:10%
chakra up way up here.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:10%
And so now we're walking around
and we know we don't feel safe.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.437 align:middle line:10%
And we need Mother
Earth connected to us

00:19:00.437 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:10%
up through our feet and
up through our base chakra

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:10%
to feel like we're going
to stay on the planet.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:10%
So that's a base chakra
typical trauma is an accident.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:10%
And another typical classical
one would be any shock,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:20.353 align:middle line:10%
any big surprise makes
us pull up and out.

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:10%
- We unroot ourselves.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:10%
- Yes, we sure do.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.987 align:middle line:10%
- We pick up our roots
and head down the road.

00:19:23.987 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:10%
- Run down the road.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:10%
Roots in hand.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:10%
- Right.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:10%
- Not good.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:10%
- Not good.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an interesting
analogy about chakras,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It puts a lot
of things perspective.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
that come to my work

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
come because they have had a
lot of trauma in their lives.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing up in their
relationship with money,

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
yet they don't know
how to change it.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how would you
weigh, in terms of the scale,

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
what you do for people to help
them financial, primarily,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:90%
medical primarily?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Where does that sit?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think financial
is the ultimate result

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and the goal that
someone comes thinking,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:90%
hey, I need help with my money.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we get into
it, what we find

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is that there are these trauma
bubbles that have literally

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
stored themselves
in those chakras.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things
that are causing them

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
the problem with the money.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But until we look
at those and we

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
help them heal those
aspects of the trauma,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
they can't make
the kind of changes

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:90%
that they want with the money.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So I look at it
kind of like I have

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of experience with
money and so it makes

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:90%
people interested in my work.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a
lot of experience

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
in looking inside
and figuring out

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
how to move through
those traumatic points,

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
because I had a lot of them.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you teaching
people how to make more money,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.913 align:middle line:84%
how to save money, how to
spend money, or all of it?

00:20:57.913 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: All of it.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And actually each of
the things you said

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
falls into one of the
chakras, which is fascinating.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.643 align:middle line:84%
So different patterns relate
to different chakras about what

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
we're struggling with.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, saving money
or getting into debt

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:90%
is in the sacral chakra.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
that is, is that--

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
remember how I
said my mom didn't

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
feel into her experiences,
she didn't feel things?

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think
about debt, debt

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
is a classic example
of someone not wanting

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the present
situation and kind of trying

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
to get what they want from
a satisfaction standpoint

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
right now but delay into
the future, like avoid.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an
avoidance of feeling.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And I see it over and
over again that people

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
who are struggling with debt
or not being able to save money

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.692 align:middle line:90%
have a sacral chakra issue.

00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was always told,
Leisa, that debt is good.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a movie
where the experts

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:90%
said dead tightens a company.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
theory of debt

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is basically using other
people's money where you

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:90%
don't have a touch your own.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So there's
two things going on.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
One is there's people
who have basically

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
been conditioned to believe
that debt is acceptable.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter that
you have a lot of debt.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Yet they are kind
of in a lot of pain,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
because they worry about
that debt all the time.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
That's completely
different than when

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
you reach a stage
where you're choosing

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to use debt because it helps
you become a better investor,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You buy a house with debt
and you create leverage.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:90%
So that helps you.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.237 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you can
support the payment.

00:22:39.237 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that's a choice.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Like if you have a choice,
debt isn't a problem.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you don't have a choice
and you're living in debt,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.783 align:middle line:84%
and you think that's your whole
life story, that's a problem.

00:22:52.783 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now back to the
chakras for a moment.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:84%
What's happening on the
planet right now with chakras?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
How many people
are aware of these?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Becoming
a lot more--

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah,
Popular, interesting.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:10%
People are asking a lot
of questions about them.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:10%
I think that people are
curious because they're

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:10%
seeing it being written
about and discussed,

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:10%
which is exciting.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I will say is that
some people look at the chakras

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and they go to somebody to
get them to fix them, right?

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I go to somebody and they
balance my chakras for me.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a big fan of that.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel like
it's like if you

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.185 align:middle line:84%
can learn how to
do it for yourself,

00:23:33.185 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be in
a much better position.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So learning how to actually
manage, and look inside,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and tune up your
chakras on your own

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to be way more
empowering than going

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to somebody and
saying you fix me.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Are there ways for these
people to do this naturally

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:84%
where they're not schooled,
they're not trained,

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
it just happens?

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I think so.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
are doing this already.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a certain
area in their body

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that they pay a lot
of attention to.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I practiced Buddhism
for many years.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the meditations
that we would do

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
would be taking and giving.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very heart
chakra centered practice.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't
realize necessarily

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that you were working
on your heart chakra

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:84%
when you did taking
and giving, which

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is like breathing in suffering
and breathing out healing.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a lot of
different ways to do it.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing it
without much training.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So the difference
is is that when

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize that there
are these messages that really

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
tell you the whole
story of your life

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that are captured
in the chakras,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I think you start
realizing that you

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.070 align:middle line:84%
could be working on
many different levels

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come some people
can do it naturally and other

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.915 align:middle line:90%
people can't?

00:24:46.915 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Ah, great question.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All my
questions are great.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:90%
We've got a great staff here.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So I
think it has a lot

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.385 align:middle line:90%
to do with mindfulness for some.

00:24:57.385 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
For me I came to this from
meditation and looking within.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've met plenty of people
from their earliest memories

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in life, they came
in and they were

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
deeply tuned in to what was
going on inside of them.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was just natural.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
They didn't receive
any training for it.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.493 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And little children,
do they have this ability, too?

00:25:17.493 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, I think
that we do this naturally.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some more than others?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes, definitely.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was a child
I would go into what now I

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.100 align:middle line:84%
see is what's called
Samadhi I would

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
go into super deep
meditation practices.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
When I had done something
wrong and I was in trouble,

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I would go into a ball.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't recognize
what I was doing,

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.933 align:middle line:84%
it was just a
natural part of me.

00:25:43.933 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you pout?

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I think it was
like a form of escapism,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
like I was upset at my family
for putting me in the corner.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody can see you
in this little ball, right?

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But then later in life
when I started meditating

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'd reach these really
deep stages of just seeing

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
everything, in
that moment I could

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
see that it was the exact same
situation of what I would go

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:90%
into when I was a little kid.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have looked at
the power of forgiveness.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:90%
What is so important about that?

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
things I can forgive,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:90%
there are other things I cannot.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:84%
If somebody physically
harmed a member of my family,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't forgive that.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I could forgive someone
who is drunk, and gets

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
into a tragic accident, and
hurt somebody in my family.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I can forgive that,
because that's a sickness.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a mistake.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't I'm out
to hurt somebody.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But somebody who would blatantly
murder someone or harm someone,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't forgive that.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Now is that something
wrong with me?

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Should I forgive that?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I don't
think that "should" is

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
the right word for anything.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
in my own journey,

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:90%
my father was brutally murdered.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And his ex-girlfriend
and her boyfriend

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:90%
had conspired to buy a gun.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't right
away, but after

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
years of exploring
forgiveness practice,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I came to the
realization that until I

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
reached a place of forgiveness
where I could have compassion

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:90%
for them doing what they did--

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.745 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: --I wasn't free.

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so you're
telling me you forgave them?

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Because I
was holding on to hatred.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
space inside of me

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to hold on to the
hatred for them.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:84%
As I looked at my
own hatred, all I saw

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:84%
was more pain and
suffering for myself.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's like it set me free.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the classic idea.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.108 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But doesn't that
give them the feeling

00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:90%
as if it was OK?

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.725 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there's a
big difference between--

00:27:55.725 --> 00:27:56.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
go to jail for this?

00:27:56.565 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: They did.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
They both went to jail,
very short sentences,

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
also kind of shocking.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was it's not that I'm

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:90%
condoning their behavior.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where maybe the snag is.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course you're not.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No, no, it's
not that way at all.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But what I did do in my own
practice-- and each of us

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:90%
have to go through this.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.313 align:middle line:84%
This is why you could never
tell somebody you just

00:28:22.313 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:90%
need to forgive someone.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to go
inside of the experience.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'll add a little
feature to what was going on.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:84%
My father was estranged from
our family when he was killed.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And he had done a lot of things.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:90%
He was a lifelong drug user.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.025 align:middle line:90%
And he was very manipulative.

00:28:41.025 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he was
going downhill.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
killed, and I started

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to look at
what had happened,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I started to notice that there
had been these letters that

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
went back and forth between
him and the people who

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:90%
had killed him.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:90%
And there was a story behind it.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't justify
or anything like that,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.350 align:middle line:84%
but I could see that my father's
behavior had most likely caused

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
them to be very
afraid for their life.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that their
motivation, self defense?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.066 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Kind of.

00:29:15.066 --> 00:29:17.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There wasn't some
insurance scam involved here

00:29:17.358 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: No, nothing.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw was that in the
end where it all came together

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is that every single
person, even though it looks

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.703 align:middle line:90%
different from the outside--

00:29:33.703 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:84%
first of all, it
always looks different.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you go deep inside
of the human experience, what

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
we find is that everyone is
doing the best that they can.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And that there
have been a series

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:90%
of events that have occurred--

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it be sexual
trauma at a very young age

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.332 align:middle line:84%
for someone, abuse,
or many things

00:29:55.332 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that could have
happened to someone

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have any
idea the story behind it.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And then they do an action.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And we say you're
a horrible person.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
all of the reasons

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
why they do what they
do in that moment.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I could
see that for myself,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I could see it for
my father's killers.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I could see it for other
people that I would easily

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
say they're bad people,
and I just don't like them.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But after a while of
questioning this way

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of just saying, I can't
forgive and looking inside

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:90%
and saying, if I make mistakes--

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted not
that kind of mistake--

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:84%
but if I make mistakes
and I can't forgive myself

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
for those mistakes,
then I definitely

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:90%
can't forgive other people.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So I started learning
how to forgive myself

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of
stuff that I've done.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you
to see a portion

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
of "Open Minds with
Regina Meredith"

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
where she talked with Dr.
James Hardt about the science

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:90%
behind forgiveness.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if you agree with him.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.370 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:10%
- Can you talk a little bit more
about the forgiveness process?

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:10%
- Sure.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Give you a little background.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in America has
heard of the Gallup Poll.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
For a long time before the death
of Sir John Templeton, a very

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
spiritual man and a good friend
of George Gallup, every couple

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
of years Sir John
would get George

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to do a poll on forgiveness.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Well one time I had a chance
to read one of the details.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And in rating the
importance of forgiveness

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
from zero, not at
all, up to four,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:84%
extremely, 80% of Americans
said they considered forgiveness

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.170 align:middle line:84%
extremely important,
80% then of those

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:84%
who considered it extremely
important, George Gallup asked,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
well, can you do it?

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
85% said no.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Even God's help was not
effective in producing

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.090 align:middle line:84%
what we call effective
forgiveness for most people.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:90%
85% said they could not do it.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:10%
Of the things that
Gallup asked about,

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:10%
there was only one thing
that was correlated

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:10%
with effective forgiveness.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And that was meditative prayer.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Well when you take
meditative as an adverb

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and put it in front of a
verb, like meditative fishing,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
meditative gardening, meditative
sewing, meditative reading,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:90%
what I see are more alpha waves.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense,
George Gallup has

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
revealed that effective
forgiveness requires

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:90%
more alpha waves.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.345 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:16.345 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you
think of that, Leisa?

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I love it.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you
to give me a test.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah?

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me a
test on forgiveness.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Throw things my way
and ask me if I would

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.735 align:middle line:90%
forgive that special thing.

00:32:30.735 --> 00:32:31.535 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: OK.

00:32:31.535 --> 00:32:34.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Are you married?

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I never discuss
my personal life.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: OK.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just supposed to-- so
if your wife cheated on you,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:90%
would you forgive her?

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Would you
forgive the person

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:90%
who she was also with?

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: OK.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:90%
That was a hard one.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:90%
So you already did a hard one.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If I were married.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: OK.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:84%
If a drunk driver
killed a child.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I want
to qualify this.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.168 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:33:12.168 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I understand.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK?

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But based on those scenarios
you've just mentioned, yes.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Throw a few more my way.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: If a financial
advisor stole all your money.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I probably
would eventually

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:90%
forgive somebody for that.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to find out
why he did what he did.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Was he in some financial mess?

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Was he in trouble, you know?

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:84%
A good friend lied to you
about something important.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd be disappointed,
but I'd forgive them.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.835 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
things I'd forgive.

00:33:45.835 --> 00:33:46.635 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:33:46.635 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You haven't asked
me about the murderer.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So the
murderer in the case of I

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:90%
mean what happened in my family.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So if someone
murdered your parent?

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It depends, I guess,
on the motive behind it.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Just based on that
question, no, I

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.120 align:middle line:90%
would not forgive them for that.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd want them to fry in
hell for what they did.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd want them to get the
electric chair for what

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:90%
they did.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know, for example--

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and don't take this
the wrong way--

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
if your father was
doing things to them and

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.386 align:middle line:84%
they saw this as
self-protection.

00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Totally.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know that.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
could be a reason

00:34:30.128 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:84%
why they didn't get
a lot of sentencing

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:90%
when they got convicted.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm most sure that
that's the case.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But I would forgive--

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.239 align:middle line:84%
unlike the 85% who
said they could not

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:90%
forgive in that study--

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I would forgive most
episodes in time,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe not immediately,
but in time,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
other than the clear cut
guy who broke into a house

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and murdered your family
or something like that

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:90%
in cold blood.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't forgive that.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truman Capote, when
he wrote the book "Cold Blood,"

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
talked with the two murderers
who broke into that house

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and killed the family
for several years

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
before he wrote the book as
he was doing his research.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:90%
He began to like them.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:90%
He began to understand them.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And to me there's
no excuse for that.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.645 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: No excuse
for what they did.

00:35:32.645 --> 00:35:33.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:33.445 --> 00:35:34.403 align:middle line:90%
You can't forgive them.

00:35:34.403 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:90%
But some people can.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You know I like the
video where he said

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:90%
"the meditative forgiveness."

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.080 align:middle line:90%
This idea that we look within.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:90%
We ask the questions.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that most of the
time it's like nobody's

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:84%
going to fault me for not
forgiving the people who

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:90%
killed my father.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
individual thing.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's you.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It's me.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It was me realizing that
that wasn't serving me

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and that I didn't want to
live in hatred and anger.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does forgiveness
give you closure?

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Very much so.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
could have closed

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
the door on that
chapter of my life

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and feel like I could talk
about it here like we're

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.903 align:middle line:84%
talking about it had
I not done that work.

00:36:23.903 --> 00:36:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
forgive a woman

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
who stole a child
from another family,

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.540 align:middle line:84%
kidnapped them, and raised
them, loved the child,

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.805 align:middle line:90%
but literally stole the kid?

00:36:34.805 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Could you forgive that person?

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Just like you, it
would take me a lot of time.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Like it is not an
instant thing for me.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I would look inside of it.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to know
more if I could.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
If I couldn't I
would try to find--

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:84%
knowing that someone who
had made a bad decision

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
but then lived in love and
cherished these children

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:84%
as if they were
her own, that would

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
help me to find some
place inside of myself

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that I could be
at peace with it.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But again I think that it's
like more than anything,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
we live our lives oftentimes
in great suffering

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:84%
without realizing all
the things that we're

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
holding on to that we haven't
looked deeply inside of

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:90%
and let go of.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And many times when people come
to me about money, oftentimes

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
there's sexual abuse from a
very young age from a parent.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean these stories
are horrific.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't tell anyone
that they need to forgive.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I allow them to see
what they want to see.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And there have been times--

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:84%
recently, I had one client
who had been sexually abused

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
by his father and
hadn't spoken to him

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:84%
for a very long
time as a result.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And we did the work together.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And he looked inside
of the relationship

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and came to a place of
forgiveness to his father

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and went back and
reacquainted with his father

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to find out that after that
conversation within six months

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:90%
his father had passed away.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, I am so
glad because I got closure

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to this horrifying thing
that had dictated my life.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm free of it now.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
he needed to do.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't maybe
the same for everyone.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just what he
needed for peace.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.992 align:middle line:84%
So how do you equate this
to your wealth clinic?

00:38:35.992 --> 00:38:37.367 align:middle line:84%
How do you put
this all together?

00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:38.167 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:38:38.167 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I found is that when
people do just what we talked

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:84%
about, and they tune
in to the chakras,

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they tune in to the messages
that are coming through,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and they forgive,
they let go, they

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:56.990 align:middle line:84%
become mindful particularly
of habits, and traits,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and patterns that they
do over and over again.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In the end, I start to
notice significant changes

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:84%
in people's lives where they
couldn't save any money.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, now
they're easily saving money.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even
have to do anything big.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:84%
They just had to change
the way that they

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:84%
were thinking about
saving money, feeling

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:90%
about saving money.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.743 align:middle line:84%
And now they're saving
money with no struggle.

00:39:22.743 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And it works for
people, doesn't it?

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It does.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you recommend
that people save, save, save

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: I recommend that
people know their goals.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
They know what they
want to create.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
If they've got really
big goals, then they're

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
going to need to save more
money to achieve that.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
If they've got little, teeny
goals, maybe one of the goals

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is just knowing that
they have the ability

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to save money when they
are wanting something.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very different for
every single person.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.010 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of why I also
think the financial services

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
industry is sort
of telling us we

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:90%
all should want the same thing.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But some people can be really
happy with very little.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Some people want a lot more.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While some people
who are multibillionaires

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:90%
want more.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean why
do you want more

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
when you have all you need?

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Right.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't get it.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: There's a lot
of studies about this where

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
you ask millionaires
on a scale of 0 to 10,

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
if you had more
money, would you be?

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And these millionaires
are like it's always

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:90%
something out there.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It's never the moment right
now, how much they have.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It's always I need
more to be happier.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about people who
latch on to people with money

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
to try to get money from them?

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: Yeah, that's
it's a creative way to go.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's feel into that.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.760 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a
heart chakra thing.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.677 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling that I
don't have the ability--

00:40:48.677 --> 00:40:51.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if it works for
them, it works for them, right?

00:40:51.343 --> 00:40:52.155 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yeah.

00:40:52.155 --> 00:40:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Well it's like they don't feel
like they have the ability

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.115 align:middle line:90%
to create it for themselves.

00:40:56.115 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia program
"Rewired," Dr. Joe Dispenza

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
talks about changing
your thought patterns

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to avoid some of that.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:84%
- The process of
change is breaking

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
the habit of the old self
and reinventing the new self.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It's pruning
synaptic connections

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and sprouting new connections.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense, then, if
you are going to transition

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
from the old self
to the new self

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and you decide what thoughts
do I want to fire and wire

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
in my brain, and you begin
to put all of your energy

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:84%
in installing those thoughts
neurologically in your brain,

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:35.000 align:middle line:84%
the act of firing and wiring
over and over again begins

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to assemble new
neurological networks.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Now neural networks
are gangs of neurons

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been fired
and wired together

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that relate to a thought,
a memory, a behavior.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.570 align:middle line:84%
The body begins to
assemble new circuits

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.100 align:middle line:90%
so it becomes more automatic.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense, then, if
you keep firing and wiring

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts and
they begin to assemble

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
into automatic
neurological networks,

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and you do it over
and over again,

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts
are going to begin

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:90%
to become familiar to you.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Then the thought in your
mind literally becomes

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.850 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And experience
enriches the brain.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.992 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:13.992 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: I like it.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's spot on, isn't he?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: It is.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if scarcity is the way
that you're looking at life,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.550 align:middle line:84%
changes to a prosperity
mindset and abundance mindset,

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.770 align:middle line:84%
everything that
he's saying, is what

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:84%
starts to dictate how
you look at the world.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we
rewire ourselves,

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.775 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Joe was talking
about, to change our lives?

00:42:39.775 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: So I
think it's first

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
starting in the idea of hope
that whatever is going on

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in your life right now,
wherever you find yourself,

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it's really important that you
not only want something more

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
but believe there's a
seed of potential for you.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
that, what I have found

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is it creates a gap
in your consciousness.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Like this is where I want to go,
and this is where I am today.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing,
because I think

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.870 align:middle line:84%
this is where
synchronicity comes in.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where you just happen
to be watching this conversation

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
today, between George and Leisa,
and you're like, wait a minute,

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for this.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.310 align:middle line:90%
You become open.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the openness, we
become available to receive

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.230 align:middle line:84%
teachings that help us
change what's going on.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's chakras.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's Akashic records.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's astrology.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We become open to
learning what messages

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.720 align:middle line:84%
could help me start to make
things different in my life

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:90%
going forward.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I just think that
people, the more they

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:84%
realize that when you change
what these thoughts are

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and these feelings
about who you are

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and how much there
is out there, then

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.155 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability to
create what you want next.

00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in Vegas a
couple months ago, Leisa,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting at
a blackjack table.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was like
four people there.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
guys at the corner,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:84%
who did not know each
other, were talking.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And one guy had a stack
of chips in front of him.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he must have been
spending thousands of dollars.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Then another guy had a
smaller, little stack

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:90%
betting at a very nominal rate.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And they were just talking.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And the guy with
the stack of chips

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
was bragging about
he had a Bentley

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and lived in this big house
in Los Angeles and all that.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy who had
a little pile of chips,

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:84%
who seemed happier, talked
about his little Honda Accord

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:84%
which he paid for, a little
apartment that he was renting.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the two and
I'm saying the other guy's

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
braggadocios talking about
all these possessions,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:90%
but he's not happy.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But the other guy who doesn't
have nearly half as much

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:90%
as what he has, he's happy.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
falls within, doesn't it?

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Most definitely.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go the whole
gamut, I want to be honest.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought that if I
had a lot of money,

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:84%
it would bring a great deal
of happiness into my life.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and I became
millionaires in our mid 30s

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and we worked really
hard to get there.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that kind
of shocked me is we

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:84%
were there and
instead of worrying

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:84%
about not having
enough money, now

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.623 align:middle line:90%
we were worried about losing it.

00:45:22.623 --> 00:45:23.423 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:45:23.423 --> 00:45:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PETERSON: It just
changed, but it didn't

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.740 align:middle line:90%
matter how much money we had.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the one thing you

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:84%
want to leave this show with
for people to understand?

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PETERSON: That they
have limitless potential

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:10%
to create the things
that they want.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And that no matter what is
going on in their minds, what's

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:10%
going on in the outer world,
they have that ability.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:10%
And just lean into it
just a little more,

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:10%
because I promise the
potential will expand

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.093 align:middle line:10%
as you give it attention.

00:45:55.093 --> 00:45:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
within us, isn't it?

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Yes.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERSON: Thank you, George.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well there you
heard it from an expert.

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.290 align:middle line:10%
It's within ourselves to
tap into our own potential.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
