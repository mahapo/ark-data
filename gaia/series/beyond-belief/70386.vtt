00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.405 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.434 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
to another edition of
"Beyond Belief," where

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
we talk about all kinds
of mysteries happening

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:10%
on this planet and
throughout the universe.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've got another
one for you now.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Jason Martell.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll call him a
modern day explorer.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:84%
He researches ancient
civilizations.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And let me tell you something.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
He finds answers to a
lot of our questions,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
such as, how did
they do these things?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Jason.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.436 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON MARTELL: Thanks, George.

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:56.852 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure
to be on the show.

00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:00.012 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did these
ancients do what they did?

00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, they
had to have been doing it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
with some assistance
of technology.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Again, a lot of the things
that we see architecturally,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:10%
looking at some of
these megalithic sites,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:10%
it really raises
a lot of questions

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:10%
as to how they could get these
stones to fit so well together

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:10%
and how they built the
structures so perfectly aligned

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
to repeating
astronomical alignments.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
help did they have?

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you know, and
that's really the question.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Was it aliens that helped
us in the past or was it us?

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, I'm leaning
more towards the us.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that there is
some lost cycle of time,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
well off the recorded
books of our history

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.694 align:middle line:84%
that we understand now, that
shows human evolution appears

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:90%
to be going through a cycle.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We've heard of the Dark
Ages or the Golden Age.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very
possible that we

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
are going to further discover
things about our past

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%
very soon here in the future.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael Cremo
in his work, Jason,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
believes that mankind is much
older than we think it is.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean hundreds of
millions of years older.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I've always weighed that,
too, the possibilities of

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
did we do this ourselves
or did ETs help us.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's think for a moment
that, like you say, we did it.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
What if civilizations
weren't 300,000 years old,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
but millions of years old?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And that we had technology that
would dwarf what we have today.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we went to the moon
back 5 million years ago.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.557 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It's a heavy thought.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And really anything's possible.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we find a
spark plug buried

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
in rock layers that show
it's 30 million years old.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a spark plug.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Or all of these types of
anomalies, artifacts that,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
again, like you mentioned
with Cremo's book,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
"Forbidden Archeology,"
he points out things

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:90%
that just kind of stand out.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is finding a
complete civilization where

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.155 align:middle line:84%
they can put into
context how they

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:90%
were using that technology.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big gap
between what we currently

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
end at the Sumerian culture
at 3800 BC into this, right.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Things that are
millions of years old

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:90%
and are clearly technological.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientists have
just discovered an ocean

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:90%
400 miles down into the mantle.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:90%
That is huge.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps bigger than what we have
on the outside of the planet.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.205 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to
myself, how in the heck

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
did the water get down there?

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Was this seepage
from our oceans?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that it's there,
and they just discovered it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
after how many years,
tells me that there's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
so much out there
about our planet

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.441 align:middle line:90%
that we just have no idea.

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Maybe it's
even a hollow Earth.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been
lots of theories that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
state certain areas in
Antarctica or Alaska,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
people either flew
directly in our somehow

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
made an expedition to
the interior the Earth.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.292 align:middle line:90%
Who really knows?

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But with our technology, I
hope a lot of these things

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
can be answered.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Discovering an ocean.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, the original movie

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.515 align:middle line:84%
of "Journey to the
Center of the Earth"

00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
with our dear friend
Pat Boone clearly

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
had an ocean inside the planet.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And here we are,
with science today

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
telling us there's a big
ocean inside the planet.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
It just is illogical that
they would have it then

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and we're finding out now.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It's baffling.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It almost
seems, too, that even

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the planet now,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
there are things
in our deep oceans

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that are more foreign to
us than our outer space.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So totally makes sense,
George, that there

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
could be interior
realms within our earth

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that, up till now, have
been mythological tales,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
but maybe there's some
reality to that as well.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, tell us a
little bit about your missions,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.975 align:middle line:84%
where you go and what
you're looking for.

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, we just
started a new organization

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:90%
called Ancient Explorers.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is to
take experts and go

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:10%
to some of these
world-renowned locations--

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuaman--
various places where there's

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:10%
this architecture of building
style, but also in placement.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Places where they spent great
detail monitoring the heavens.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the quest
that I'm planning over

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
the next few years is several
expeditions where we're

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
going to take groups
of people with us,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
but also deploy technology--
ground-penetrating radar,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
high resolution aerial
drone photography--

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and start to map out
and look for things that

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
might be on the tertiary
of some of these sites

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and haven't been discovered.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you looking for
things like the Nazca lines

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.874 align:middle line:84%
that are in Peru,
things like that?

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: That's
a great example,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
George, is all over
Nazca, everyone

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
knows of the lines
on the plateaus.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But on the surrounding
mountain range,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
there are geometric figurines
and mathematical diagrams.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Really, the only people
that investigated this

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
were, I think, Erich
von Daniken in one

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of his "Chariots of
the Gods" videos.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a well
known thing to see

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
all these mathematical
geometric figures in Nazca

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.515 align:middle line:90%
in the mountain ranges.

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can only see
them from the sky.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm still
baffled by the pyramids.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm baffled by things
like Stonehenge

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.629 align:middle line:84%
and how these things
might have been created.

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Me, too.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you bring
up the pyramids.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we've been looking into

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
is the whole idea that the
great sarcophagus in the King's

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Chamber doesn't have a lid.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just a box.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, the dimensions
of that great sarcophagus

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.474 align:middle line:84%
are identical to the
Lost Ark of the Covenant.

00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
That thing that we
always see with laser

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
beams and high energy
source, that possibly

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
could have been sitting in the
Great Pyramid, powering it.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I say that because
the depiction of Moses

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and the Ark, all
throughout Egypt

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
there are a golden box with
a pole on each side being

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
referenced and shown well
before Moses' exodus.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is some possibility
that the Great Pyramid

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.765 align:middle line:90%
was a large energy reactor.

00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know many scholars,
Christopher Dunn and others,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
have looked at the idea of how
Giza and these three pyramids

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
are harnessing
energy in some way.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
go on excavations

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.131 align:middle line:90%
or merely exploring tours?

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well there's
two ways to do it.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.994 align:middle line:84%
Tours is more or less
for the public outreach

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and getting people
to be involved.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you let
them come with you.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.949 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: We let
them come with us.

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And the excavations really
is more of a business play.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times when we go
to sites like Machu Picchu,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and we want to deploy
aerial drone photography,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But by working with the
local military or the tourism

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:84%
organization and donating
all of our drones

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
once we're done, somehow
they're a little bit more

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
accepting to
allowing us to film.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So we use political
means, business means,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to get access where we then
want to have the ability

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.205 align:middle line:90%
to take the tour.

00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, in our previous
Beyond Belief program with you,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
we touched on just
briefly the artifacts

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
have left behind,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The Baghdad Battery
being one of them.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.421 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
the Baghdad Battery,

00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
again, is well known
in mainstream science.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:10%
And very interesting
depiction of it

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:10%
is that it was used to
electroplate jewelry.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And another thing that they
theorize it was used for

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:10%
was, you know, back
thousands of years ago,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:10%
ancient churches would
always be competing.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes they would
use the Baghdad Battery

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and connect it to a statue, and
create a large static build-up.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.535 align:middle line:84%
So that you'd walk in and
if you touched the statue--

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:32.866 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: --you'd
get a zzz and you'd

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
be like, oh, the power of God.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's alive!

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.899 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of interesting.

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But alternative use is
it was a power source.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:90%
It was literally a battery.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
George, the Baghdad Battery

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that we well know of,
all throughout Egypt

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.234 align:middle line:84%
we see larger versions,
possibly 6 feet tall.

00:08:49.234 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same concept?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Same concept.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And talk
about that concept.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.531 align:middle line:90%
How did it work?

00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So if you think
about using something

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.055 align:middle line:84%
this size to power--
we've tested on camera

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:04.674 align:middle line:84%
and got about 4 volts off of
a battery about 4 inches tall.

00:09:04.674 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does work.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.423 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So if you
figure one 6 feet tall,

00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe we can generate
literally hundreds of volts.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
apply that towards

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:90%
other technological references.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they not say
that the Ark of the Covenant,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.851 align:middle line:84%
when touched, could
electrify you, basically?

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
pharaoh named Akhenaten,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
but possibly was
also known as Moses.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole other story
to the exodus of Moses,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
where Akhenaten was
this great pharaoh that

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
left Egypt and took his people.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But he also took the Ark of the
Covenant, this battery source.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, all throughout
ancient Egypt,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
there are depictions
of the Ark, predating

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
it being used to carry the Ten
Commandments, still in Egypt.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think if Moses was
Akhenaten, this great pharaoh,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.299 align:middle line:84%
he took the Ark
with him and that's

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
a great reason why the pharaoh
would come charging after him.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.597 align:middle line:90%
He wanted his battery back.

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I also think it could
have been a light source,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
possibly.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, you're right.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It was always depicted--

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a flashlight.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: --of lights
and energy coming off it,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
so it could have
also have been used

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
as some type of large
light source as well.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would they have had
knowledge even to do that then?

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what we talk about
this knowledge that is lost.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who would come up with
a rod, copper wire around it,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
electrify it, electrolyte
on the inside.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.554 align:middle line:90%
How would they know that?

00:10:30.554 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, the
easiest explanation

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.319 align:middle line:84%
is to say that aliens
gave it to ancient man.

00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
that simple, George.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a lost
epoch of civilizations.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be
one great civilization

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'm on the coattails
of trying to figure out.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Right now we call it Atlantis.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's Atlantis.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.864 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think you're
right because I think

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:52.955 align:middle line:84%
if aliens gave us
battery technology,

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:55.065 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have been
in that primitive form.

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:56.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Probably not.

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:57.265 align:middle line:90%
It'd be something way--

00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like what
we have today.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Or
something way fantastic

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're just
scratching our heads.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lithium.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Lithium.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But what we do find is that
there is strong evidence

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to suggest there have been high
technological civilizations

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that influenced all the
great ancients we know

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of today-- the Aztecs,
Mayans, Sumerians.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to have pieces of
this lost ancient technological

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
civilization that, today, we
hint at as calling it Atlantis.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a much deeper question
that's being explored.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This lost
cycle of time,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
whether it was with how did
the pyramids get made-- what

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
happened, in your opinion,
for it just to go away?

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And let me cite an example.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Even over our 200 years,
let's say, since the 1800s

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to where we are today, there
is a chronology of information.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing we have missed.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We know exactly what happened
then-- the bubonic plague.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:90%
We know everything.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.315 align:middle line:84%
We know everything
that happened.

00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:04.459 align:middle line:90%
It's all cataloged.

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: For 200 years.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we know.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's go way back
to the ancients.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Where did it get lost?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Bible is written.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Tablets are found.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
They talk about these
ancient stories.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.310 align:middle line:90%
But then it ends.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Something stops.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere can I find
how did they build

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids or
anything like that.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's a very esoteric
question to answer, George.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The answer I'd give you is that
we go through a repeating cycle

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth that causes a
rise and fall of civilization.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.495 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we've heard
of the Dark Ages, what

00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
we've just kind of came out
of over the last few thousand

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've also heard
of the Golden Age.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.939 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that
history might not just

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:49.605 align:middle line:84%
be linear, that we
were dumb in the past

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
smart in the future.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not that simple.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.117 align:middle line:84%
It appears that we went through
something recently called

00:12:56.117 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:90%
the Dark Ages.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
happened to us.

00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: And we lost
a lot of the information

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.796 align:middle line:90%
that we can trace happened.

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:03.295 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if we look
at the Sumerians

00:13:03.295 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Egyptians,
high levels of astronomy.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
High levels of architecture.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We go into the Dark
Ages, we forget it all.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.442 align:middle line:84%
And as we start to come
out, Copernicus and Galileo

00:13:14.442 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
start to rediscover,
well, wait a minute.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:90%
We're not the center.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:90%
We orbit the sun.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians and
Egyptians knew that

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:90%
just a few thousand years ago.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they
were just starting

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to lose all the information
as we went to the Dark Ages.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We're now starting to rediscover
it all again exponentially.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.839 align:middle line:84%
And everyone feels the
increase in knowledge.

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could there have
been a catastrophe that

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
wiped everything out,
albeit the flood,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
where we lost the knowledge?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:90%
It stopped?

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.447 align:middle line:90%
There was no chronology?

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It could.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
paradox there in that

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
this cycle that repeats, the
last Golden Age that we were in

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
was around 10,500 BC.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
it was postulated

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that we had a great flood.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a yin
and yang situation here

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
of when we are in the Golden
Age, that doesn't preclude us

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
from having
catastrophic events that

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
could cut all that
knowledge in half

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:90%
or reduce it significantly.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
explorations, you

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
come across structures
that have been

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
built by man that
are very strange.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll call the pyramids that
way or Stonehenge that way.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%
What are they for?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
What do they represent?

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I
think the vast majority

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of these structures have
astronomical references.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They were either used as an
outpost to monitor the heavens

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
or they were built,
like the Giza pyramids,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
as ways to mark specific
alignments that repeat.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the
three pyramids in Giza

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
are forming a terrestrial
map of the sky of the Orion

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:84%
constellation, the
three pyramids.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But that alignment doesn't take
place until 10,000 years ago--

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:90%
actually, 13,000 years ago.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, the Egyptians, if
they were around in 2500 BC,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
built the pyramids that aligned
to the Orion constellation

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:90%
at 10,500 BC.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:10%
Either the Egyptians have
been around a much longer time

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:10%
than we think or the
Egyptians are also

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:10%
aware of this cycle
of time, and were

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.985 align:middle line:10%
pointing back to saying that's
when we were at our Golden Age.

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
That's when we
are at the highest

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
point of our civilization.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.319 align:middle line:84%
And we're acknowledging it in
this astronomical alignment.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know for sure yet.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well now, this
structure I want to show you.

00:15:29.818 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
This stacked wall, for example.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Sure, Sacsayhuaman.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:15:33.712 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: This is
the classic type

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
of architecture of mortarless
technology, where they were

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
able to heat these stones
to a lava-like state.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very
easy and pliable

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.785 align:middle line:84%
to stack them and
fit them together.

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would they touch
them if they were that hot?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Don't know.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
How would they move them?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they move them?

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.816 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Don't know.

00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But we can see that
there's a glassing

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
effect from high heat,
which we call vitrification.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a byproduct of any
type of high heat being

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:90%
exposed to a stone.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And then it re-hardens.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So all throughout
these megalithic sites,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
this type of building style
is accompanied by high heat.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how ancient man

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.546 align:middle line:84%
was able to heat the stones
to a lava-like state.

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any technology
that we're aware of to do that.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.562 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How high
is that, Jason?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:90%
What are the dimensions of that?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I don't
know the actual dimensions

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:90%
of Sacsayhuaman.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But we're probably looking
at about a 50-foot wall.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.664 align:middle line:84%
If you can look in
the far left corner,

00:16:28.664 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:90%
you might see some people.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're really
dinky next to that wall.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They really are.

00:16:32.665 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
There these are megalithic
sites, so most of these stones

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.216 align:middle line:84%
are trilithon stones, stones
that weigh hundreds of tons.

00:16:39.216 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
build a wall, you

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.091 align:middle line:84%
generally are building it to
keep something out, aren't you?

00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:45.256 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, what's
really interesting, too,

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these sites, like all
over Peru and South America,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
they were sites that were
built next to a standing lake,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
like Lake Titicaca or Giza
being right next to the Nile.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
We can now look at these sites
and see that Lake Titicaca lays

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
several miles from these
sites, just like Giza

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is several miles
away from the Nile.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
So those are, again,
geological references to date

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
these without carbon dating.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We can see geological
pieces that we

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
can track the time that it
must have taken for the waters

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to recede and give us an
idea of their true age.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.229 align:middle line:84%
And it's much older than we
are currently think it is.

00:17:20.229 --> 00:17:20.854 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge has
always fascinated me.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:90%
That structure.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that was for?

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.723 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, we
know it was, again,

00:17:28.723 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to monitor this knowledge of
the movements of the heavens.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It marked vernal
equinoxes and knew

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
when certain alignments
were taking place.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But really, not only is
it the knowledge of making

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:84%
these alignments happen,
it's the architecture.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.551 align:middle line:84%
How were they able
to move and stack

00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:47.633 align:middle line:90%
stones that were so large.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Again,
the big question.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:90%
The big question.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.416 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: One of the
theories that we hear come out

00:17:52.416 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of possible ancient
aliens and theories

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
like this is some type of
lost levitation or sound.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precisely.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.541 align:middle line:90%
Resonance.

00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:01.248 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's been things
now today in modern science

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
where they can literally
use sound and hover

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
a layer of water in
midair on top of sound.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's a
small taste of what

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
they were doing with sites
like Stonehenge, moving rocks.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it reminds
me of Coral Castle

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
down in Florida,
Homestead, Florida,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
where the old man Edward
Leadskalnin, 120 pounds

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.917 align:middle line:84%
from Latvia, moved stones as
big as Stonehenge by himself.

00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Really amazing.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He basically
hinted that he

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.215 align:middle line:84%
knew the secret of
levitation, of magnetics.

00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Who knows?

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows, right?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: He really could
have been on to something.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more we
explore these alternative views

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.504 align:middle line:84%
with Tesla technology
and sound vibration, even

00:18:44.504 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
things that we're doing at
the Large Hadron Collider

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
at CERN, subatomic
collision of particles,

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
we're literally discovering
new particles and things that

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
show us there is
another level of science

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to start
to utilize once we can just

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:90%
wrap our hands around it.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For you as
an ancient explorer,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
what has been the oh
wow effect for you?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think
the oh wow effect

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
for me is just realizing
that history is much more

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%
interesting than we think.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I've always been fascinated
by ancient cultures,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but we kind of know
everything now.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And so getting that sense of
wonder is really something

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I strive for in
my life, and push

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:84%
myself to keep
things interesting,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.352 align:middle line:90%
to have that sense of curiosity.

00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
really drives me

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
to wanting to go
to these locations.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.047 align:middle line:84%
And not just visit them,
but turn over a new stone

00:19:37.047 --> 00:19:37.899 align:middle line:90%
while I'm there.

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
tried to find Atlantis?

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, just
recently, with my partner

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
through Ancient Explorers,
we traveled to Dwarka

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:90%
as you well know.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are, again, sites
that are being discovered

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.924 align:middle line:84%
that are underwater,
right off the coast of--

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deeply under water.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.756 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:19:56.756 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Right off the coast of
many of our continents.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
just one city that sank.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be many of them--
Dwarka, Yonaguni, Atlantis.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Even sites like Gobekli
Tepe in Turkey or Rapa

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.566 align:middle line:84%
Nui, Easter Island,
way out there.

00:20:12.566 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think we
just need to go

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
through these sites
with a fine tooth comb,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
start to find more

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:90%
connections with these sites.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
caused these areas to sink?

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Surely it's not the
rise of sea level.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
They could not have
gone that high.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: No.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.385 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: There must
have been something.

00:20:29.385 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went down,
something like that.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.366 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There must have been some
cataclysmic event, or something

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that we just can't quite define
that shows those cultures

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and pushed them to bury
a lot of their evidence.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Like Gobekli Tepe was
buried under the sands.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:90%
The moai heads in Easter Island.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They buried them.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They did.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:90%
They buried them.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:90%
The moai heads in Easter Island.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're
not just heads

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:90%
when we rip away the sand.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're bodies.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.871 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They're full bodies.

00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:90%
So why did they cover them up?

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
say in Easter Island

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.967 align:middle line:84%
that they moved those
structures by walking them.

00:21:02.967 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Very odd.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pulling
them back and forth

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
as they basically
walked into place.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I find that hard to believe.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think that that
is one of the suggested views.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And there have been some
successful recreations of that,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:90%
but more with smaller statues.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more
megalithic-size stones,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I still think there
is a challenge where

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.625 align:middle line:84%
we find stones that
weren't fully quarried

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and are still in the
quarry site and then moved.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
several miles.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes 5, 10 miles that
they were moving these stones.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So it really raises
a lot of questions.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
will be the dramatic discovery

00:21:39.195 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
for us, Jason, that's out
there that we haven't really

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:90%
even put together yet?

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.085 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think the big
whistleblower in the next 15

00:21:48.085 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
years, in my
personal opinion, is

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.261 align:middle line:84%
going to be life
beyond planet Earth.

00:21:52.261 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
believer in that?

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Big time.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.562 align:middle line:90%
Bacterial form, plants.

00:21:56.562 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not exciting to me.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it to you?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's the
foot in the door.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we go to
Mars and say, hey,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:90%
there's bacteria there--

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I'll be bummed.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --big deal.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, right.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on.

00:22:04.898 --> 00:22:05.842 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: No.

00:22:05.842 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
we're on a track

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that very soon, these
types of discoveries,

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:84%
the scientific community will
just have to acknowledge it.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, it will
lead to bigger doorways

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
like small lifeforms or,
hopefully, intelligent life.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it
definitely exists.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Our path to
interacting with them

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is very murky in trying to
ascertain that with you,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.480 align:middle line:84%
with looking at the
current envelope

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:90%
that we would call ufology.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many believe
we've been visited

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and continue to be visited.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.252 align:middle line:90%
Where are you in that camp?

00:22:39.252 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
I definitely think

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that we've had
visitations in the past.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone looks at our
current layer of ufology,

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
there's something
continuing today.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
the public hopefully

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
will be ready for
in our lifetime.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I think at my age of 40--

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're ready for it.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Let's do this.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they made
an announcement today.

00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
If they said ladies
and gentlemen,

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:84%
we have been withholding
information from you since 1947

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
want you to be scared.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
We were concerned that
you would go crazy.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you think people
would handle that?

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.237 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: They'd probably
say, I knew it all along.

00:23:18.237 --> 00:23:19.028 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know it.

00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Those liars.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't they tell us?

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.556 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:23:21.556 --> 00:23:23.101 align:middle line:84%
And since NASA's
inceptions, right?

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
The Brookings Institute,
"The Brookings Report."

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
We have outdated procedures.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
basically said people

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.754 align:middle line:90%
would panic if you told them.

00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.284 align:middle line:84%
We just have outdated
procedures that

00:23:32.284 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
hopefully some of
these new discoveries,

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's just
some bacteria on Mars,

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the policies then need
to be rediscovered.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
If you've got just a
fraction of a chance, that

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:84%
opens the door to
yes, it is possible.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would it
help or hurt religion?

00:23:45.997 --> 00:23:48.205 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think it would
definitely help religion.

00:23:48.205 --> 00:23:50.014 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I'm
seeing-- You know,

00:23:50.014 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I was raised as a Christian.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And everything that I see from
my research into these topics

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is more and more people,
regardless of their religion,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:84%
are becoming more curious
about their neighbor's view

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
or what happened in the country
next door, because we start

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
to see a crossover in the
stories of where we come from,

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
all overlapping and kind of
telling a very similar story.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you don't
think people will panic.

00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: No.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we lose control.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.381 align:middle line:90%
Riots in the streets.

00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Probably not.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:90%
In my opinion, probably not.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I think if literally
there was even

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
some ufological event like
all of a sudden, Jesus,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
let's say, something that
looked like Jesus was on a cloud

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and descended over Wilshire
Boulevard in Beverly Hills,

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
people would freak out.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But then instantly we return
to the scientific mind.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, what type of
gaseous atmosphere

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:90%
is allowing him to float?

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
His robes, what are those
materials made out of?

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have more of a
interest of a scientific layer

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than a religious layer
that's always been in the past

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:84%
how we would view any
type of phenomenon.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there,
or has there been,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
based on the things
you've looked at, Jason,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is there a dark
side of any of this?

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I personally
believe like anything,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
there's light and
dark, yin and yang.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And what we unfortunately have
to deal with is good and bad.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really
give you an answer

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:90%
other than my personal opinion.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, for whatever
reason-- my personal opinion--

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that the dark forces,
however that be,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the watchers or bad
aliens, are very vague.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the globalists.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think
that there's been

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%
bad influence for a long time.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's slowly
starting to lose--

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
they're starting
to lose that grasp.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And more positive influence,
knowledge and things

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
about our past where
we start to realize

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
the significance of
where we come from,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
overshadow these things

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that, as you said, over
the last 200 years,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
we've been so articulate,
chronologically seeing

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:90%
our record.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
But that's just 200 years.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
look 200,000 years,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
200 years really is not as
much of a context significance.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be for you
the most incredible discovery?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I guess
in my lifetime,

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd really love to
see intelligent beings

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:90%
interact with humanity openly.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems to have
been a norm in the past.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians interacting
with their Annunaki.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans and
Aztecs interacting

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:90%
with Kukulcan or Viracocha.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So all around the
world, even the Hindus

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and their Vedic gods, there
was a time in ancient times

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
several thousand years ago
where man openly interacted

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
with these beings they
thought were gods.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Today we look at
it as mythology.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.857 align:middle line:84%
I'd love for that gap
to be bridged again.

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:32.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fallen angels.

00:26:32.815 --> 00:26:34.467 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you
mentioned good and bad.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's possibly in
other scenarios of how we would

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:84%
interpret biblical tales, there
were arguments, and squabbles,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and disagreements between
what we labeled as gods.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.182 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of these gods
had their own agendas.

00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were in alignment,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:90%
some of them weren't.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to have
been a time in our past

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
when, right after we were done
interacting with these gods,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:90%
they left for some reason.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they had great battles.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
their job was done.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.703 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: We really don't know.

00:27:10.703 --> 00:27:14.219 align:middle line:84%
But there is definitely a
lost piece of our history

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
where we connected
with these beings.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd really like to
see that happen again.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Greek mythology.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that those
gods were extraterrestrials.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, what's
interesting about the pantheon

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
of gods in Greek mythology
is that the whole idea of 12

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:90%
is repeated from other cultures.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12 Apostles.

00:27:33.522 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:90%
The 12 disciples of Jesus.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:90%
The 12 tribes of Israel.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:90%
The 12 Greek Olympians.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The Annunaki coming
from the 12th planet.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So there is a thread
of information.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12th day of Christmas.

00:27:46.255 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: 12th
day of Christmas.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.171 align:middle line:84%
There is a thread
of information that

00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
has spidered into
all of our time,

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and calendar, and
date-- dating system

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that seems to have been used
thousands of years in the past.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we shift to
this Gregorian calendar,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:84%
we lost some of the accuracies
that are natural rhythmic

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:90%
flows that ancient man had.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, in the past,
over 30 ancient cultures

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
used astronomical references
as a celestial calendar

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and were much more in tune with
the natural rhythms of nature.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
We've kind of lost
that, and are now

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
starting to look at
that with fascination

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that the
Egyptians, and Mayans,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and various ancient
cultures were somehow

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
in tune with this
connection that we now

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:90%
are striving to understand.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What you do has
got to be fascinating.

00:28:37.127 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It really is, George.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful to
get to do what I do.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And many people ask, how
can I do this for a living

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
or become an ancient
astronaut theorist?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I say, you just
need to find what

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:90%
you're passionate about in life.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be stamps.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
If you like stamps,
then go big in stamps.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But do something that
allows, in your business,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:84%
the ability for you to
then explore these topics.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And be one of
the best at what you do.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
There really isn't
a lot of money

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
to be made as an entrepreneur
in exploring ancient sites.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unless you find it.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
unless you find it.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You find it.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.211 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: But the
entrepreneurs around the world

00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
can definitely unite
and help further

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.387 align:middle line:84%
move this needle
of understanding.

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:18.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you found
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:29:18.303 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:90%
what would you do with it?

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, if they let
me publicly talk about it,

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd come on your show and be
like, George, it's the Ark.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would it be
yours if you found it?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: No, it
would not be mine.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would not be.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It would
be the world's.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
finders keepers?

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.013 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: No.

00:29:30.013 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:10%
You know, "National Treasure,"
and Nicolas Cage and those

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.019 align:middle line:10%
shows, I think are great because
we all want to have wealth.

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:10%
But as you mentioned, I think
if anyone is lucky enough

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:10%
to discover or find something--

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Something like that.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: --on
that level, wealth

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:10%
is probably just a piece
of that great platter being

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:10%
delivered to you.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You couldn't
sell it for $1 billion,

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: $1 billion
only gets you so far.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But if sharing that
with the world--

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.095 align:middle line:84%
that's something that will
extend beyond your lifetime.

00:29:58.095 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I probably couldn't
spend $1 billion

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
as a human being anyways.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: My pleasure, George.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
nothing like it.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Hes an ancient explorer.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:10%
He's looking for past
civilizations and knowledge

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:10%
of the things they possessed.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Knowledge that might
exceed what we do today.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:33.734 align:middle line:90%
