00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Marc D'Antonio is
our special guest.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
He's got a degree in astronomy.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
He's also the
chief video analyst

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
for the largest aerial anomaly
organization on the planet.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Marc is the CEO of FX Models.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that
company, Marc.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MARC D'ANTONIO: FX Model
started in 1995, George.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:10%
It was just a--

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:10%
I was making models as a kid.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We all did.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right, we all did.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:10%
I made aircraft
models, and I'm the guy

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.722 align:middle line:10%
that got the glue
on the windshields,

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:10%
couldn't get it off.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.575 align:middle line:10%
It ruined the models.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:10%
But you know what I did was
I learned how to repair that.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:10%
I learned how to fix it.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
And I got kind of good at it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And I got the eye, caught the
eye of the Navy over time.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know I'm
building models for the Navy.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it led to
advanced projects

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.027 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of other--

00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
do with these models?

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: --amazing
opportunities.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.812 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were used as
presidential briefing models.

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have been
used in special shows.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
other models that have

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:90%
been used by the Joint Chiefs.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it goes on and on.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.265 align:middle line:90%
And I'd pinch myself.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.065 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd pinch myself and
say, how did this happen?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I have a degree in astronomy.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So I actually make
astronomical-related models,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have a whole suite

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of 3D printers, as well, in
order to make these really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
high-quality models
that we would

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:90%
like to then set out there.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's just incredible.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
science has failed us.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.922 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: This goes
back to astronomy.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can only speak
from astronomy, per se.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It's-- here's how it works.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It works with
things like looking

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
at a black hole for the
first time in human history.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We looked at a black hole
55 million light years away,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
far out in the galaxy,
far out in the galaxy

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation of Virgo.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.258 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Far, far away.

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Very far away.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And we actually saw a black hole
in the center of this galaxy.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It's called a Super-Massive
Black Hole, SMBH.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, we love acronyms
in astronomy.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And this supermassive
black hole was phenomenal.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The science worked
because we had

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.898 align:middle line:90%
predicted what we would see.

00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
We predicted what we would see.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we finally saw it,
it was exactly as expected.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's where science works.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But where it fails us is
in the realm of trying

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to figure out other things,
like how old is the universe?

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Fact of the matter is when
we talk about the Big Bang,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
it sort of defies your
intellectual understanding, all

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of us, not just you, not
just me, but everybody.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
To start from an
infinitely small point

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and expand into the
universe, we know

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that's almost 92 billion
light years across.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
How would we know that?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it comes down to the
fact that we can only look back

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of time.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:90%
The universe is a time machine.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
We look back in time
when we look at the sun.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.778 align:middle line:90%
It's eight minutes old.

00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
That's how long it takes.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how long it
takes the light to get here.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's
exactly right,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.063 align:middle line:84%
when it takes that long
for the light to get here.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
We can see out just about 13
billion years in our history.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that, it's sort
of foggy because it's something

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
called the Cosmic
Microwave Background--

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and we love those acronyms--

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
CMB.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
That Cosmic Microwave Background
is sort of opaque to us.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And we can see things from
it, and it kind of gives us

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
an indication of what was
before, what was then.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And now the universe
is expanding out.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:90%
We're looking back in time.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a time machine.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Every star you
look at in the sky

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing at a
different point i time.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of them could
be already dead, right?

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yes, Indeed,
like the constellation Orion.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
In Orion, we have this
beautiful red star

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.633 align:middle line:84%
in the upper-left corner
called Betelgeuse.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful star.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's 700 light years away.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
That means the light left
there that we see today,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:90%
700 years ago.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets
here, it's a train

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:90%
of light coming from that star.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Train of light, but Betelgeuse
is going to go supernova.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So when it goes supernova, which
could have already happened,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
we won't know about it until
that train of light showing

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:90%
it happening gets to us.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We won't be around.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
This generation.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Maybe not.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.208 align:middle line:84%
But what if it
happened 690 years ago?

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's possible.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we might be able to see it
in 10 years, if it did happen.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
astronomers seen,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Marc, that they
didn't anticipate?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well,
one of the things

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that we have not anticipated
seeing, or even understanding,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that when we look at
galaxies, galaxies with spiral

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
arms like our own, we expected
that stars close to the center

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
would move fast, like Mercury
moves fast around the sun,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and that stars farther
out would move slower,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
like Pluto moves
lazily at 245 years

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.423 align:middle line:84%
to go around the sun compared
to Mercury, which takes 88 days.

00:04:56.423 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But when we looked
at galaxies, we

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
thought that we'd see the
same model being reproduced.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: And that was the--

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you asked that question,
that question of why

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:90%
not is perplexing and has been.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%
But we have some ideas.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I say the collective we.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
When we look at a
galaxy, we notice

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that it almost spins sort
of like a rigid disk.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So the stars in the
outside are whipping along

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
at an ungodly speed, and
the ones in the inside

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
are moving at lower speeds,
exactly opposite of what

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Newtonian physics would tell us.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.097 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
It means we have to
come up with some reason

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
why it's not unfound to
have such an occurrence.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that we
have called dark matter.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
That's where dark
matter came from.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:90%
What is dark matter?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which takes up a
pretty big size of the universe,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.555 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: It does.

00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like 23% of what
we know in the universe.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge amount,
isn't it, 23%.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.262 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.262 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we can't see it.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: No, we can't.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And because of the way
the universe is expanding,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
the universe is actually
accelerating in its expansion.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.025 align:middle line:84%
When Edwin Hubble came
up in 1929 and produced,

00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:84%
by analysis of galaxies,
came up with this idea

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that the universe was
expanding at a constant rate.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:84%
After the Big Bang, boom,
things are expanding

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:90%
at a constant rate outward.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's great.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So we came up with something
called the Hubble constant.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the latest
revelations from the Planck

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
telescope and other research,
we've discovered that

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:90%
the Hubble constant isn't.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not what
it was supposed to be.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It's
not a constant.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It's actually showing
us that the Hubble--

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the expansion is
actually accelerating.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, that has repercussions
like you cannot believe.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We believe the universe
is 13.8 billion years old.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, but wait.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
That's based on thinking
that the Hubble constant was

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:90%
constant.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:90%
So what if it's not?

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: If it's not,
that means that the universe

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.483 align:middle line:90%
is actually younger.

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Much younger?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Mm, maybe 12 and
1/2 billion, maybe 12 point--

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does that mean
planet Earth is younger?

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: That means that
intelligent life effectively

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:90%
develops sooner in the universe.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this all the
time all over the world.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, when
I drop on people that they

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
are in a planet that might
have had the ability to develop

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
intelligent life sooner because
the universe might be younger,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:90%
they're like, what?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientists have just
calculated that in our galaxy,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
there could be 36 intelligent
civilizations much like ours.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do they get
those kind of calculations?

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.398 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I can give you
an idea how that happens.

00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
When they calculate
these things,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
they're basing it on
the only way we know

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
how to examine the universe.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's through statistics.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%
We can't count all the stars.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't actually know how
many stars are in our own--

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's impossible.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right, because
we-- do you know why?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we're looking
through the trees

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.895 align:middle line:84%
and trying to calculate how
many trees are in the forest.

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: You have
to be outside that.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:02.958 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:03.066 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At night.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We have--

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:04.815 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At night.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to look outside
the forest to find out

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
how many trees.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
We can see other galaxies.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.397 align:middle line:84%
And we can figure out
their star counts.

00:08:10.397 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But we can't do it
in our own galaxy.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.842 align:middle line:84%
We statistically
interpolate data we do know.

00:08:16.842 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And based on the data--

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We project.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.393 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yes, we
project, exactly right.

00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And we project this
and we figured hey,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe we're looking
at, and they came up

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:90%
with the idea of 30, 36--

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 36

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: --possible.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:90%
But do you know what I've heard?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the number
of-- well, I know this.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.785 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
number of stars

00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy, which can be
anywhere from 100 billion

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:90%
to 400 billion.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which could
increase it or diminish it.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.076 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Or diminish it.

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard as high as
10% of the stars having

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:90%
potential Earth-like planets.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That could lead us
up to 40 billion

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:90%
possible Earth-like planets.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that
would be exciting.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.005 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And you've heard
of that the Drake equation.

00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:53.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:55.945 align:middle line:84%
Who helped formed SETI,
Search for Extraterrestrial

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.733 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
the Drake equation,

00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:01.445 align:middle line:84%
it calculates the probability
of life in the universe, right?

00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And you basically multiply
a bunch of factors

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
together and come up with a
little number that kind of

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.802 align:middle line:84%
gives you an idea of how many
intelligent species there

00:09:07.802 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:90%
are possibly in the universe.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It is a projection.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, that projection, in the
past, when Frank Drake did it,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
was based on having no knowledge
of planets around other stars.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:18.633 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right?

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And now we
know there are probably

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:90%
untold millions of planets.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.026 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when you look
at the stars at night,

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and if you go to the most
dark location on the Earth

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and you see all these
tens of thousands of stars

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.415 align:middle line:84%
that you can see in your
view, there's more planets

00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%
than there are stars.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
many are Earth like?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And the
number that are Earth like

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:84%
depends on how many planets
are in the habitable zone

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
around the star, which
is that little green area

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
around every star, potentially
every star, where it's not

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:90%
too hot, not too cold.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.363 align:middle line:84%
It's the Goldilocks zone,
hence the story, right?

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
they assume is what

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
life needs in order to survive.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Exactly.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Why, though?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we're a carbon-based
life that utilizes oxygen

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
to catalyze into energy, to
create energy from, right?

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Carbon-based life, in my view--

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of said
this in my book--

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is a template, I think, more or
less, delivered by the universe

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:84%
by comets, meteors, asteroids,
and by the Earth itself,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
creating these basic fundamental
building blocks of life.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
planet that makes

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:90%
the building blocks of life.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
We have an astronomical
object colliding with us

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that have given us
building blocks of life.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We see the building
blocks of life

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
on moons of other planets
in our solar system.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
We see these building blocks,
at least at a rudimentary level,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
in Mars, which is supposedly
devoid of anything.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:90%
But there might be.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We know actually there's
a 12-kilometer long lake

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
under the south pole of
Mars that could actually

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
house microbial life.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Why would we even think that?

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Because in Antarctica,
there's Lake Vostok

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that's over a mile or two
beneath the Antarctic surface

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Permanently locked
in the ice which

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.223 align:middle line:84%
has over 3,500 different
species of microbial life.

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you brought up
dark matter and dark energy.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at NASA's
WFIRST mission

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.602 align:middle line:84%
and see how they
tried to equate this.

00:11:18.602 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:10%
- The universe, for all
we have learned about it,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:10%
we have only just begun
to reveal its secrets.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:10%
What are dark matter
and dark energy?

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:10%
How common are planetary
arrangements like our own?

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:10%
And how many planets
in our galaxy

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:10%
have the potential
to harbor life?

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:10%
WFIRST, the Wide Field
Infrared Survey Telescope,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:10%
will help answer these
fundamental questions.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:10%
WFIRST is similar to Hubble,
but with the benefit of 30 years

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:10%
of technological improvement.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:10%
Each image from its
wide-field instrument

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:10%
will have the depth and clarity
of Hubble's best, but capture

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.045 align:middle line:10%
a sky area 100 times larger.

00:12:02.045 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:10%


00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:10%
WFIRST will take the
lead in exploring

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:10%
dark energy and dark matter.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:10%
We only know they exist by their
effects on observable matter,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:10%
yet these two
mysterious components

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:10%
make up 95% of the universe.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:10%
WFIRST's powerful
2.4-meter mirror,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:10%
an enormous field of view,
will also help us in the search

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:10%
for planets beyond our
solar system, or exoplanets.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
technology, Marc, is just

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
amazing to allow us
to do these things.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Isn't it, George?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just an amazing thing.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And right now we have
an orbit that's actually

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
surveying a wider swath
than the Kepler even could,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
which was our first
exoplanet satellite that was

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
up there to study these things.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine if Galileo

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:90%
had that kind of equipment?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh, my gosh.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez!

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: They would have
thrown him in jail way earlier.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.497 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well, we have the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey

00:12:57.497 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Satellite, TESS.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
TESS is up there, and it has
like a 25-by-95-degree field.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And it looks at thousands
of stars at once.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
This is going to look at
even more stars at once.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So we are literally on the
cusp of being able to discover

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.195 align:middle line:90%
other planets like our own.

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:15.995 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget--

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:16.087 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is exciting.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.873 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: I know.

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget the James
Webb Space Telescope.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
This JWST, as it's
called, this is

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
going to have the ability to
look at exoplanet atmospheres.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I said before,
we're carbon-based species.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:90%
We catalyze.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
We use oxygen to
make energy, right?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Our planet has been
producing oxygen

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere for over
2 and 1/2 billion years.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So we stand out like a sore
thumb to a galactic community

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
looking for other
lifeforms like their own,

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
if they're carbon based.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.917 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of lifeforms, you're

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
an astronomer who believes
we've been visited by ETs.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.702 align:middle line:90%
That's a bad thing to be.

00:13:58.702 --> 00:13:59.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:10%
Seth Shostak, who's
an astronomer for SETI

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:10%
believes they're
out there, or he

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be doing what he's
doing, looking for them,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:10%
listening for them.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't believe
they came here.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
What made you think
we've been visited?

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: For a long
time, I've read the reports.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.098 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a healthy skeptic.

00:14:19.098 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nothing
wrong with that.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Nope, nothing
wrong with that at all.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, to be a good
analyst of these things,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
you have to be a
healthy skeptic.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.927 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be skeptical.

00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
You can't say, oh, that's a UFO.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Wee!

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I win!

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't win.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is
when you look in the sky,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
you get a report
of something, you

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
have to figure out
what's real, what's not.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put it through
regimented data analysis.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And what comes
out of the bottom,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
if something comes out the
bottom, is a true unknown.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can say, this is
a true unknown right here.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.102 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff, it could have
been a bird, or this or that,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
a satellite, whatever.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:84%
If it all drops out and fails
that test, then what's left,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.843 align:middle line:84%
however improbable,
is the truth, right?

00:15:01.843 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And that's
something that we all look for.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
an encounter ever?

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: I've actually--

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And part of the problem is--

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem
like you're hesitant.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.202 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: A little bit,
and I'll tell you why,

00:15:16.202 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
because as a science guy,
you don't really accept these

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.102 align:middle line:90%
things until--

00:15:22.102 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, what happened?

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well, until
they happen to you.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I had something slammed up my
nose, and I was awake for this.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw a being or whatever you
want to call it in my room.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
losing my marbles.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I tried to explain it in
terms of a medical anomaly.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Something locked in.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It had a gray forearm
and a gray hand.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And this translucent
wand went under my face.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you
know, I wake up,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.732 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a pool
of my own blood.

00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely terrifying.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
go to the hospital?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And that's
a great question.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my own blood,
drowning in blood.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:90%
I had to cough and get it out.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god!

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: And what do I do?

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I did what anyone who has that
terrifying experience does.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I got dressed, and I went to
work, forgot all about it.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Holy Toledo!

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right?

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't
you go to the hospital?

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
If I woke up in a pool of blood,
that's the first place I'd go.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.008 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:17.808 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Hello!

00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you 1,000%.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.133 align:middle line:84%
So tell me why it
took two years for me

00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to go to an ear, nose, and
throat surgeon to look up here,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to a nostril that no longer
could breathe from that moment

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blocked.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Blocked.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, there's
something huge up there.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we're
going to remove it.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:90%
He numbed it.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
He did a whole
procedure, removed it.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally something
the size of my two thumbs

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:39.715 align:middle line:90%
stacked.

00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did look--

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:90%
was it organic?

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It wan an
organic-looking thing.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It came out looked
like that big.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:90%
That's huge!

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It came out that little hole.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It was as like
watching "Total Recall"

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:90%
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
[VOCALIZING] He
pulls this thing out.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what it felt
like, you know?

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.155 align:middle line:84%
And I had to literally--
he had to hold

00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
my head so he could pull it.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:90%
But he got it out.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.925 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I'm
going to send this down

00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to the pathology.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.312 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him, in retrospect--

00:17:03.312 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
look like a growth?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It
looked like a growth.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it was
one of these things

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
called a nasal
polyp, or whatever.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But then I-- and I
regret it to this day--

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, can those things
seed around a small object,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:90%
a foreign object?

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, you mean
like a metal splinter

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that a machinist
might get up there?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, it's
possible, yeah.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, why?

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I explained a little bit
about the terrifying nature

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.545 align:middle line:90%
of what I had experienced.

00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:33.345 align:middle line:90%
And he laughed.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I'm
sure it's not aliens.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.694 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, no, I'm
sure, in my mind going,

00:17:37.694 --> 00:17:38.986 align:middle line:90%
oh, I shouldn't have said that.

00:17:38.986 --> 00:17:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Practical
doctor that he was.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I
shouldn't have said it.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.645 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I shouldn't
have said it, right?

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:90%
He said, call me in a week.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what happened.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to send
it to pathology.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, can you take it?

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, I can't let you.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
We got to do a biopsy,
make sure it's OK.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
So I call him a week later.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Hi, is Marc D'Antonio.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wait, doctor
asked to talk to you.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:90%
When has that ever happened?

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Only if it's bad news, right?

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, oh--

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You hate those calls.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: --I've got, like,
head cancer or something,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:90%
My head's going to fall off.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: So he
gets on the phone.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Mr. D'Antonio,
just want to let

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.142 align:middle line:84%
you know it's probably
just a regular old polyp.

00:18:13.142 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to worry about.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wait, probably?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't have the results?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
palpable silence.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.318 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, this,
to be honest, he goes,

00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:90%
this has never happened at all.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And I can't make this up.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
In all my years, he goes,
I sent it to pathology,

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and they seem to have lost it.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:33.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They lost it?

00:18:33.952 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's
what they said.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Someone took it.

00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: And I didn't--

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I gave them the
benefit of the doubt.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I went out there feeling
like, oh, man, this is--

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I get off the call
thinking, that's not right.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So a few years later,
I went to him again.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And this time I
filled out a sheet.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:90%
It said, what do you do?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I wrote, oh, I do special
projects for the Navy.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And he came in and said,
oh, special projects.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And I told a little more
detail about what I do.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
He looks at me and says
the following words,

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.122 align:middle line:84%
I just gave up my top
secret clearance this year.

00:19:06.122 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I got out of the programming.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I said,
are you working

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.382 align:middle line:84%
on top secret nasal
polyps or something?

00:19:12.382 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I was there for a
different reason.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, no, no, no.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- and then
he says, I was

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
part of a project to shoot down
an enemy satellite with a nuke.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And I went, what?

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.368 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't inquire
further about the program.

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.168 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah--

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ear, nose,
and throat specialist?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.168 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: And I said that.

00:19:32.168 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I wasn't
always a surgeon.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.943 align:middle line:84%
And I go, so you've maintained
this for all these years?

00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah, I gave it up.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's too much hassle.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I got,
he said, "read out

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:90%
of the program," as he said.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he basically sat
there and told me this, just

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
him and I in this exam room.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of blown away.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But I knew exactly
what happened,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:90%
having worked on such--

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.757 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was taken.

00:19:56.757 --> 00:19:57.557 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:19:57.557 --> 00:19:58.557 align:middle line:90%
He had to make the call.

00:19:58.557 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had to--

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: He had
plausible deniability

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because he called
whoever he has to report

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to, because he has
to by law, report

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
anything that could potentially
be a national security threat.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And he probably-- here's
how the call probably went.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I had a patient who had
this thing, and I removed it.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.973 align:middle line:84%
He said he had a
terrifying experience where

00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:84%
it looked like it might
have been implanted.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.297 align:middle line:90%
That's all I know.

00:20:19.297 --> 00:20:21.255 align:middle line:84%
And then they probably
said, OK, what hospital?

00:20:21.255 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And they told him the hospital.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:90%
What patient name?

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.795 align:middle line:90%
They probably gave them my name.

00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK, thank you.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of call.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:84%
He has plausible deniability
about where it went.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if the
call went like this?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh,
I want to hear it.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have another patient.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:10%
This is the 20th one that
I've taken an implant out

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:10%
of their nostrils.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I've got another one for you.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: That sounds like--

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if it was
something like that?

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.215 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: That sounds
like a Dr. Leir kind of call.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:45.783 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
There is an ET contactee
that I interviewed,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Kate Thorvaldsen who
has had 29 implants.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Over what period of time
you think this 29 devices

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.885 align:middle line:10%
were implanted in you?

00:20:56.885 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KATE THORVALDSEN:
I don't know.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:10%
They can have been putting in
there since I was 10 years old.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:10%
Or if they--

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or three.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: Possibly.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.677 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: But since I--

00:21:06.677 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:10%
since I feel that I remember
everything, everything that

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:10%
happened when I was
three years old,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm not including that time.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you had these
devices scanned and X-rayed?

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
we took X-rays.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:10%
We did.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:10%
And it was actually a bit
funny because, of course,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:10%
you can't go to
your local doctor

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:10%
and say, hey, I think that
I have implants in my body.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Can you take X-rays of them?

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they
will, again, call

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:10%
the men in the white,
not the men in black,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:10%
but the men in white.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:10%
Take her away, yeah.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:10%
So they also through
UFO Norway, they

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:10%
had this chiropractor that
had his own X-ray machine.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:10%
So they were actually sneaking
me in from the back door.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.492 align:middle line:84%
They did not even put
my name in the schedule.

00:21:45.492 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:47.843 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.843 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Kate Thorvaldsen
and I toured Norway together

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:90%
last August.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a great
deal time with her.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I came
away from knowing Kate,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
as I know her, is that she
is not being dishonest.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
She has never been dishonest.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She seems legit.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.088 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: She
seems legit to me.

00:22:06.088 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:10%
And this is a science
guy talking here,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:10%
who basically shouldn't believe
that stuff, yet there it is.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:10%
I can't deny-- you
can't deny evidence.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
You can deny motivations.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:90%
You can deny human-based things.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:90%
But you can't deny evidence.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.025 align:middle line:84%
When you deny evidence,
then you become ignorant.

00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:24.825 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.825 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since the object was
taken out of your nostril,

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.057 align:middle line:84%
can you breathe
better, obviously?

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:30.098 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, I can.

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, George,
I'll be driving down the highway

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
or driving, doing something,
and I will feel a burning pain

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
right where it was.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.575 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I need
to claw through my skull

00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:41.575 align:middle line:90%
to get at that location.

00:22:41.575 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's so--

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That aggravated?

00:22:44.672 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It's so
bad that I literally

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
have to close my
eyes, and I have

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:90%
to stop a car from driving.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I have to stop using tools.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I got to sit down, and I
literally just press on my face

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.378 align:middle line:84%
as hard as I can,
and it doesn't help.

00:22:55.378 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
wait for it to go.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, I hear a
high-pitched whine in my head.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it's from.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.447 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
I could say, well,

00:23:03.447 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's just a medical thing.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm open to that.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But considering the
chain of events,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:90%
it becomes less likely to me.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
it was placed there for?

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Was it a tracking device?

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.977 align:middle line:84%
And if it was, put it in your
arm or something like that.

00:23:19.977 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: I know.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that people
are very cognizant of scars

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
on their bodies.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're also very much aware
of changes to their bodies.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
They're most intimate
with their own things

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
they can see on their body.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think that what
happens is going up

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
the sinus may be a way for
extraterrestrials to tag us,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, maybe, not
necessarily true, but maybe

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:90%
in the same way that we tag elk.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have also
had an amazing experience

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
with an unidentified
submerged object

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
when you were on
a nuke submarine.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I was a
guest on a submarine.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.108 align:middle line:90%
I had done work for the Navy.

00:24:00.108 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
literally-- and this

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:84%
was the words I got from
the people at the sub base.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.005 align:middle line:84%
They said, hey, you
want to go on a ride?

00:24:06.005 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know the Navy doesn't
give "rides," quote, unquote.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.763 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Navy nine years.

00:24:09.763 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They don't give rides.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: No.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But I did get to go
on a nuclear sub.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
The exact nature of
it is what it is.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's down the road.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is I got seasick
because what people don't know

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:90%
is subs don't always submerge.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
They stay on the surface
for a lot of time.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They rock.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And they
rock like a you know what.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I got seasick as a dog.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the kid that
passed as a doctor on the boat,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:90%
and I got a patch.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time, there was no
patch available in the market.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.518 align:middle line:84%
But the Navy was the
test bed for this new--

00:24:43.518 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To keep you
from getting nauseous.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Scopolamine
patches, or whatever, right?

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And that went on my neck.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.392 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, huh,
that's interesting.

00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And it started to work.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But in order to calm
down I sat in what's

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:90%
called the sonar shack.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a little side alley
from the control room.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
You have the control room
where the guys guide the boat

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and drive the boat.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Then to the side here
are the sonar machines,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.592 align:middle line:90%
and there's like four of them.

00:25:03.592 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
There was one guy
at the first one.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I sat at the second seat, after
asking permission if I could.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And they said yes.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in the
sub but on the surface.

00:25:11.757 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: No, no,
we had gone down.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had submerged.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like everybody
who's watching now feels.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- you
can't feel the motion.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you don't even
know you're under water.

00:25:21.815 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: No!

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The only reason you know
that you're under water

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:90%
is because the rocking stopped.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%
The rocking stopped.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
You feel a subtle
vibration in your feet.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.445 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you feel a
little shaking in your feet

00:25:31.445 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
as the sub goes
through a little patch.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It vibrates.

00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, a little bit.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.812 align:middle line:84%
But-- so as I'm sitting
there, the kid's

00:25:38.812 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
now-- they call him a kid
because that's what he was.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at the
submarine sonar.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of zoning
out, deep breaths

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
because I'm getting
over my nausea.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have this
patch on you and all.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.773 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
as I was starting

00:25:50.773 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to hear that white
noise as you're

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
starting to fall
asleep kind of thing,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it felt good because
I was like, OK,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.832 align:middle line:90%
this nausea's going to go away.

00:25:57.832 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
I hear, con sonar!

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Con sonar!

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Fast mover!

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Fast mover!

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.147 align:middle line:84%
And like, boink, I'm wide
awake going, oh, gosh,

00:26:04.147 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be killed out here.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.237 align:middle line:90%
Is that a torpedo?

00:26:07.237 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I really got an adrenaline rush.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows, right?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: I didn't know.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.843 align:middle line:90%
I thought, fast mover--

00:26:10.843 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've heard those
characterized as torpedoes.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, am I going to die?

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:90%
This is in the Atlantic.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.265 align:middle line:84%
And the executive
officer comes around.

00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at the screen.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.213 align:middle line:84%
He goes, OK, how fast
is that thing moving?

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
course and bearing?

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the kid is facing away
from me looking up at the XO.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see it?

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.652 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah,
but you know what?

00:26:28.652 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I can't make heads or
tails of the sonar.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:90%
So it was just a little--

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:90%
it was there, and--

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It was there, and it was gone.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the XO was up here
looking down at the kid.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And I could hear the XO.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And the kid was sort of muffled
because the sounds on a sub

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:84%
are fairly loud, a
lot of loud noise

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in the sub, high-pressure
area, shh, and other things.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But the Navy, of course,
prides itself on that sound

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:90%
not getting out.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
So I heard him.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear him say
the course and bearing.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But when he was asked
the speed, he looked,

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.145 align:middle line:90%
he kind of went like this.

00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, sir,
several hundred knots, sir.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.318 align:middle line:90%
And the XO said, mm, OK.

00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're sure?

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yes, sir.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Sir, yes, sir.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Log it and dog it.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Sir, yes, sir.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And that meant log it
and then get rid of it.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa, wait!

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So me, Mr. Seasickness
no more, because I

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:90%
was totally OK right now--

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.765 align:middle line:84%
believe me, adrenaline
makes you feel better fast.

00:27:27.765 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I got up and went
over to the XO.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, XO, I'm familiar
with these fast movers.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything I can
help you with, with this?

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:90%
He goes, Mr. D'Antonio, right?

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I go, yes, sir.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, you having
a good trip so far?

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, I am.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's keep it that way,
smiled and walked away.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And I
walked back to my seat,

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and I sat down excited
beyond excitement,

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but feeling about this big
because I said that, but, yeah.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And then several
years later I had

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
to do a job for
the Joint Chiefs.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.138 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're the big wigs.

00:27:59.138 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
They work for the President
of the United States.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big job.

00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And I was
nervous, but I did the job.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.403 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving it
down to Washington.

00:28:07.403 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I was driving it down
to Washington, when I finally

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:84%
got there, I met with
one of the chiefs

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
privately, one of the
appropriate chiefs.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him--

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and in my head I was
saying, don't ask.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And the words were
already coming out.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell me about
the Fast Mover Program?

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
I can't believe.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.035 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.035 --> 00:28:30.452 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He stopped
in his tracks.

00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well,
nah, you know he did?

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
He could have said--
you're right, George.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.332 align:middle line:84%
He could have said, I have no
idea what you're talking about,

00:28:36.332 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:90%
or what's that?

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:90%
He could have done that.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We'd worked together
a bit on this project.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So instead he looked
at me and said,

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I can't talk about
that program, Marc.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That tells you volumes.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh!

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.147 align:middle line:84%
I almost crashed driving
home from Washington.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like, bridge, OK.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Whoop, car.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:55.785 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:90%
I was so focused on this.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I was fixated on the fact
that the US Navy certainly

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:90%
is tracking them.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
know what they are.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, a guy who
tells us a lot about these

00:29:04.955 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is Emery Smith, who's on
Gaia's "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.683 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Wow.

00:29:09.683 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: It all started
because the energy signature

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:10%
down there they spotted somehow
using their technologies

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:10%
with satellites.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And they sent a couple
of drones down there.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:10%
And they captured
on film these craft

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:10%
coming in and out of this
area in the Marianas Trench.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:10%
I don't know exactly
where it's at.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:10%
So they decided
this is something

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:10%
very important that we
need to study, of course.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:10%
So they spent billions
and trillions of dollars

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:10%
to get these facilities down
there so they can monitor

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:10%
what the extraterrestrials
are doing and where are they

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:10%
going and tracking the craft
through the oceans as well.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:10%
These craft are no
different than the craft

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:10%
that they're using to
travel intergalactically.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:10%
So that being said,
they're creating

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:10%
their own gravitational
field, even in the water,

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:10%
and they can go very, very fast
and do these right-hand turns.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And you hear a lot
of these stories

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:10%
of the subs and other
military coming and going out

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.690 align:middle line:10%
of the water.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And so it's a-- and this has
been visualized and videotaped

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.613 align:middle line:10%
by the military for many years.

00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I get so many phone
calls from ex-military

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
who have been on
ships above water,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and they see lights
underneath the water,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
under the surface,
just cruising along.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:90%
What the heck could they be?

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well,
clearly, we know

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
there are bioluminescent
creatures in our ocean.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But they don't just
cruise along faster

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.217 align:middle line:84%
than your ship
underneath the water.

00:30:39.217 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not those things.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.633 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: No, something else.

00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, could it be that an
object moving through the water

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
is causing the
bioluminescent creatures

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to glow all along
the way, and they're

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.357 align:middle line:84%
different creatures along the
way as they're moving around

00:30:51.357 --> 00:30:52.157 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:30:52.157 --> 00:30:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe so.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
something down there.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think these are,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:84%
just UFOs that just
seem to go underwater?

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Nah.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's
a deeper question.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a question of,
who may be-- and I say "may"

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:90%
because we don't have proof--

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:90%
who may actually be visiting us?

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
be another country?

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.545 align:middle line:84%
No, not with the
technology that we're--

00:31:17.545 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can
probably rule that out.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I think we
can rule that out safely.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians
don't know what it is.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The Americans don't
know what it is.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Chinese
don't know what it is.

00:31:26.396 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: The Chinese
don't know what it is.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.862 align:middle line:90%
The Australians don't know.

00:31:28.862 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Other navies don't
know what it is.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:84%
They just know that
they're tracking them,

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.505 align:middle line:84%
and they call them
different things.

00:31:33.505 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some submariners
call them, on our boat,

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.770 align:middle line:90%
we call them jellyfish.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, and some
have been seen underwater.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.822 align:middle line:84%
And then they burst through
the surface, and they take off.

00:31:41.822 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah,
that's another--

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And those, I want to
see a really good video

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:90%
of that that's real.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:90%
I see--

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to see that.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:90%
We may have that.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.978 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Maybe so, but
we don't have it released.

00:31:50.978 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Pentagon
just admitted

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:90%
about the "Tic Tac" UFOs.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yes.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Remember when Commander
Fravor actually

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:10%
said that he saw the Tic Tac
down there at the surface,

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:10%
but then something below it
was bubbling up on the water?

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.933 align:middle line:10%
>>D'ANTONIO: Could
that thing bubbling

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:10%
below the water been like a
USO similar to what I saw?

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I say "saw," experienced
on the submarine?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was that.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But that means that they're
ubiquitous through our oceans.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, it means that we

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
have had visitation for a
long time, if it's all true.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I reserve the right
to say that I could

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.978 align:middle line:90%
be wrong about this stuff.

00:32:25.978 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they hiding?

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Is that why they're under water?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Think about this.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
To answer that question in a
fair manner, what if you go

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.533 align:middle line:84%
and you're studying
grizzly bears?

00:32:38.533 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
do it from a blind

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and from a safe location,
probably far away looking down,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe through
drones or whatever.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
go walking among them

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:90%
because they will maul you.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They will destroy you.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So an alien civilization here
would probably necessarily

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.540 align:middle line:84%
be frail in physical form
because maybe they evolved

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:90%
for long distance travel.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're very frail.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So all that stands between them
and us is their technology.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We know their technology has
failed, don't we, in the past.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's
possible that--

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We assume it has.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.617 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: We
assume, thank you.

00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:90%
We assume that it has.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't walk into
grizzly bears you're studying.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
What you would do is watch
them from a distance.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So what I say, and
this is how I say it,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
any alien life here will
go where we are not.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And where are we not?

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:90%
In the deep ocean.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.012 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:33:31.012 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: So there you go.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably explored
the ocean more than we have.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.393 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well,
they know there's--

00:33:36.393 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:90%
they may very well have.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But to them, it's just
an ocean environment,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:84%
an ocean biome that they
already know everything

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:84%
about because they've
experienced it probably

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands, if
not a million years ago,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:84%
in their own iteration
on their planet.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marc, let's talk for
a moment about the visitations.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
If we think back to the
theory of Zecharia Sitchin,

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki came
here from an extra planet

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:90%
And they genetically seeded us.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever creatures were on the
planet at the time, subhumans,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.179 align:middle line:84%
that they altered us a little
bit, and we became them.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that
these visitations are let's

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
see how they're progressing?

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how these
children that we created

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:90%
are conducting themselves?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.365 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:25.032 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's
a very good question

00:34:25.032 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and one that I've actually been
fielded before when someone's

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:90%
thrown this at me.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And my feeling goes to this.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
All of our culture and
all of our belief systems

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:40.690 align:middle line:84%
are founded on some
what might be myth,

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:84%
what might be
observation, and what

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:84%
might be something that was
experienced in ancient peoples

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and pushed forward through time,
obviously changed a little bit

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
as time progressed because
people change things

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
without trying to,
embellishment or whatever.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:90%
But could that have happened?

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as being
seeded, the only issue

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I have with the
seeding possibility

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.070 align:middle line:84%
is if you look at the
interior of your body,

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we have a love affair
with sodium, right?

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:90%
We're salty.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And sodium is just one atom.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Salt of Earth.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.723 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's right.

00:35:15.723 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Sodium chloride, right?

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And sodium chloride
is, of course,

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
something that
washes off of old--

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:84%
early planetary masses into the
low-lying areas like in water.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.148 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: And so they
would combine and form

00:35:29.148 --> 00:35:31.750 align:middle line:90%
sodium chloride in the oceans.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.998 align:middle line:84%
Well, theoretically, we
come from the ocean, George.

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So that means that when
we come out of the ocean,

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
we have to, like turtles, carry
a vestigial ocean within us

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to continue this
dependency on sodium.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what the skin is.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It contains this
little vestigial ocean

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%
we actually carry.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a lot lower
percentage than the ocean salt.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But it is a vestigial
ocean nonetheless.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So if we were seeded, we would
have to have been seeded way

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:90%
before that event, you see?

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we could have.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't rule that out that
we could have been seeded way

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I certainly
don't rule that out.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I think the more I learn about
our planet, because in my book,

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how the evolution
of the Earth has occurred.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are many things
that have happened here

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have answers for.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:84%
252 million years ago,
we had the Permian era.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And we had the Great Dying,
where 98% of all life,

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
roughly, was wiped
out by some event.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't think it was an impact.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was this
large volcanic eruption

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.030 align:middle line:84%
in what is now the
Siberian traps location.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But if it was that, then you
could see-- and of course,

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.340 align:middle line:84%
science is sort of generating
how life in the ocean

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:84%
could have decimated itself
over time through such an event.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And they create models.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:90%
We're great at models.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm good at models, physical
and computer models, right?

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So I create models.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:90%
They create models.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
In their models,
they show that, well,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
over time, we would see the
levels of carbon dioxide rise

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:90%
precipitously.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We'd see the levels of
oxygen in the ocean drop

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
precipitously as the
oceans heated up from this.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And we would see
this decline in life.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And they say, ah, that matches.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.950 align:middle line:90%
That must be it.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happened, though?

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It's one possibility.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we take God
out of the equation,

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
isn't it conceivable that
everything in the universe

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:90%
is the same?

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the primordial soup,
that life that evolved here

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:90%
would evolve there.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be in
the same sequence.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
have a dog that's

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:90%
as intelligent as we are.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some dogs are, by the way.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But that you're going
to have human beings

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:84%
on other planets because of
the evolution of how it works.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:90%
you

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: You know what?

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:84%
That is something that I've
pondered for a long time,

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:90%
if we think about that.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.280 align:middle line:90%
You look at us humans.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We're bilaterally symmetric
on the left and the right.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:90%
We're kind of even.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.547 align:middle line:84%
The way we interact
with our environment

00:38:06.547 --> 00:38:07.700 align:middle line:90%
is through symmetry.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Every life form on this
planet has symmetry.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
We all have DNA,
Deoxyribonucleic Acid, ooh,

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But that DNA may
spur the symmetry.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
it, it's based on carbon.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.590 align:middle line:90%
We're carbon based.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.815 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually something
called CHONPS, Carbon,

00:38:26.815 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen,
Phosphorus, and Sulfur,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:84%
wow, elements in
our periodic table.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:90%
But that's what basis--

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that's the basis of DNA
on our planet, right?

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Every life form has it.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So if every single life form,
of all the millions of varieties

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and past probably billions
of varieties over time

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.960 align:middle line:84%
have had this, is
it not conceivable

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that that was a template
provided by the universe,

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.560 align:middle line:84%
in some fashion, delivered by
comets, meteors, and asteroids,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as being produced
by the Earth itself?

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.247 align:middle line:90%
We have seen how--

00:38:59.247 --> 00:39:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's conceivable.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yes.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that means if
that's a pattern here,

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.160 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't it be a pattern
there or there or there?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be that
we're the only ones based

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.910 align:middle line:90%
on carbon-based life?

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Carbon is delivered by all
these astronomical objects

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to this planet.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.940 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So therefore, maybe-- maybe--

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:84%
it was delivered to
other planets as well.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And we-- because I
can't say for sure,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
because that's science
speaking, but if it was,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:84%
we know then that carbon-based
life, which requires oxygen

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to catalyze energy
and make into energy,

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
would probably be
an equation as well.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: NASA asked you to
look at some other images

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
so you could interpret
some of these things.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I have five of them.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the first one.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And while we're looking at
it, tell us what we're seeing.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Well, this
was presented to me

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:84%
by a well-known television show
to examine and try and figure

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.760 align:middle line:90%
out what this was.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.842 align:middle line:84%
This is actually, after
I did some processing--

00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this an
aerial, or what is this is?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, this is a
satellite view looking down,

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:90%
something captured by satellite.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it looks for all the
world like a cruise missile.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was launched and
heading toward Utah.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And was it going to
hit Salt Lake City?

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god!

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.205 align:middle line:84%
And they were
like, well, is this

00:40:24.205 --> 00:40:26.570 align:middle line:84%
like a hidden military
project that went haywire?

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Did somebody go rogue?

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.695 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:40:28.695 --> 00:40:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or was released
accidentally or something.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Exactly so.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But when I looked at this
image, I said, no, no,

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:84%
nothing the fear, because take
a look at the variety of things

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:90%
you can see in this image.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at the contrail.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.798 align:middle line:90%
Cruise missiles have one engine.

00:40:42.798 --> 00:40:43.965 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing two contrails.

00:40:43.965 --> 00:40:44.798 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's two.

00:40:44.798 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: You got it.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So right away that tells you
it's probably not a cruise

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
missile, right?

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you could see two
little engines or something.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah,
well you see those--

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.425 align:middle line:84%
like halfway down, you see
those two little white things?

00:40:54.425 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Then
they go further back,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and you see two more
little white things.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.237 align:middle line:90%
It also looks like a tail.

00:41:00.237 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's right.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you-- and at
the top of that thing,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
you actually see what looks
like what could be a windshield.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.272 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, I actually
was able to identify this

00:41:10.272 --> 00:41:12.610 align:middle line:84%
as a specific
aircraft because it--

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind?

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.755 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: This was a
Bombardier ERJ, a regional jet.

00:41:16.755 --> 00:41:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An earthbound jet.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Absolutely,
caught from the air.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, I say this
often, the ordinary

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:84%
captured in an
extraordinary manner.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.863 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it
doing out there?

00:41:26.863 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It was
flying to Salt Lake.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.627 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Simple as that.

00:41:30.627 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at our
next image, see what that is.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: This image, this is
interesting because I got this

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.928 align:middle line:84%
image-- now, again,
being an astronomer,

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm well aware that your photos
you take of the night sky can

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:90%
be ruined not by lack of focus--

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that can always happen-- or
motion on the telescope--

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:90%
whoops, that can happen--

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
but by the atmosphere itself.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And in this photo, I was
presented with this image

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:90%
and said, whatever is this?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.485 align:middle line:84%
Because this is on the dark side
of the planet taken at night.

00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a time exposure.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.152 align:middle line:84%
You can tell it was a
time exposure because

00:42:02.152 --> 00:42:03.085 align:middle line:90%
of the blurriness.

00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the International Space
Station that you see there

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:90%
in the images.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.050 align:middle line:90%
This was taken--

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long object?

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yep.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:84%
That was a truss from the
International Space Station.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.035 align:middle line:84%
And that glow that
we're looking at--

00:42:13.035 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, the
halo, what is it?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Right.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:90%
What is that, right?

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they asked
me that, I said, well,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.168 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
night-side shot, you

00:42:20.168 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:84%
have to understand how
the atmosphere works

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.250 align:middle line:90%
during the daytime.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.370 align:middle line:84%
During the daytime, the atoms
of the atmosphere absorb energy.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And at night, they
tend to give it off.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And when they give
off this energy,

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
they give it off in
the form of light.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And different atoms give it
off in a different wavelength

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:90%
or color.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, so
the top there, we're

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at atomic
oxygen. The green

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.050 align:middle line:84%
is going to be oxygen and
nitrogen. And below that,

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
the yellow is sodium
atoms in our atmosphere.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This is something
called air glow.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's the bane of
professional observatories

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
all over the world because
you can take photos and see

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.880 align:middle line:90%
the air glow from places like--

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, did you
tell NASA what this was?

00:42:56.032 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh, they-- yeah.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they already knew.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: They
already know, NASA, yeah.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But the television
show didn't know.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And I told them what it was.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
this is air glow.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our next object.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh, yeah,
this is a great one.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This was someone
looking at Google Earth.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And they reported that a
plane went down in this lake.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if a plane went down,
especially a jetliner

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
like that, the first
thing you would think

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:25.527 align:middle line:84%
is, it's not going
to remain intact.

00:43:25.527 --> 00:43:26.985 align:middle line:84%
They could do a
Sully Sullenberger.

00:43:26.985 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we'd know about it.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah,
we would know about

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because every single
house around that lake

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:84%
would have reported
it and called it in.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: So my
job was to figure out

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:90%
how could this have happened?

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, clearly, when you look
at how Google Earth images are

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:84%
made, this presents to
everyone a beautiful world

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
view of your planet
that you can go

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:84%
look anytime of the
day or night and see

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:90%
all this different imagery.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But you're seeing successive
passes of satellites.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes one pass,
for instance, in this case,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
had an airplane, a true
airplane you could physically

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:90%
see flying over that lake.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The next satellite pass didn't
have that airplane in it

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle line:90%
and just got water.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
behind the scenes,

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:84%
the images are
stitched together.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.290 align:middle line:90%
So you get this.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got one image
here, one image here.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They are stitched
together and blended.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And when they do that blending,
you get blended imagery.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.655 align:middle line:84%
So the actual plane blended
with the actual lake produces--

00:44:25.655 --> 00:44:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Made it look
like it was underwater.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, it makes
this ghost image, exactly.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And this happens a lot.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look at--

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.703 align:middle line:84%
I think we have one
more image here.

00:44:34.703 --> 00:44:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Oh, yeah.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.737 align:middle line:90%
Now, this one, right here--

00:44:37.737 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're looking
at a boat yard.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:40.270 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: We are.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But you see that yellow
thing in the middle there.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Why is that yellow thing?

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a duck.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Looks like a
big giant rubber duck, huh?

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rubber Ducky.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.738 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, you think
it's a big giant rubber ducky.

00:44:50.738 --> 00:44:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was presented
to me as a hoax.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Said, look at this hoax.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wait,
don't be so sure.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I started to go
through other imagery.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Is this the last image?

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.875 align:middle line:84%
Because there's one more
image that actually shows--

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There may be one more.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let's go to the
next-- last one.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.565 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: A sea-level
view of this thing,

00:45:07.565 --> 00:45:08.440 align:middle line:90%
if there is one more.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have one more?

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: And there it is.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: It's
an actual rubber

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.477 align:middle line:84%
duck the size of
a freaking house.

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.143 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
we were looking at.

00:45:15.143 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: Yeah, we were.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we called
that right, didn't we?

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: I did.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, nah, actually,
that's a real rubber duck.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.425 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, are
you out of your mind?

00:45:22.425 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, that's a real rubber
duck, as far as I can tell you.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, you look,
and look what they found.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, you see,
analysis-- sometimes

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:84%
analysis takes you down
a path you don't expect.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not everything
you believe to see.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>D'ANTONIO: That's correct.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.468 align:middle line:84%
And you can't believe
everything you see.

00:45:41.468 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
sometimes what you see

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.230 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievable but is real.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.945 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
those examples.

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marc, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: George,
I had a great time.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
great astronomer.

00:45:52.638 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And you bring us fascinating
things to discuss.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: I appreciate
the time, yeah.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people get
a hold of you or track you?

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>D'ANTONIO: They can
find me on Amazon.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.353 align:middle line:10%
They can look at "The
Populated Universe" book

00:46:03.353 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:10%
and see if they
want to buy a book

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.437 align:middle line:10%
about extraterrestrial
life and the fact

00:46:06.437 --> 00:46:09.180 align:middle line:10%
that life in the universe may
be the rule, not the exception.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:10%
That was the premise of
the book based on science.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:10%
They can find me at
my website, which is--

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:10%

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm the Mutual UFO Network's

>>D'ANTONIO: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It was a great time.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.842 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So many strange
things in this universe.

00:46:46.842 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's great to talk
to somebody who can make

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:10%
some sense out of some of it.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
