>>GEORGE NOORY: I have
known Army Colonel John

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Alexander, our next guest here
on Beyond Belief for years.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
He is an expert on
UFOs, remote viewing,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:10%
after-death experiences.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's my pleasure to welcome
John Alexander to Beyond

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Belief.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:84%
John, it's always a
pleasure seeing you.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN B. ALEXANDER:
Thank you, George.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Ah, pretty good.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are-- we're going
to talk about a lot of things

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:90%
with you today.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But UFOs on the top
of my list with you.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
When you were studying UFOs
and investigating them,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and you still are, did you
ever come across anything

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.664 align:middle line:84%
that we really
need to know about?

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, as
you know, the first line

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:10%
of my UFO book, UFOs are real.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:10%
I think the first thing you
need to know is absolutely real.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:10%
What they are, that's
kind of a different story.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And I argue that the issues
are down to fundamental,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:90%
like how do you define this?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a problem.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, you've got
low balls of light

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:10%
and they've got hard craft
more than a mile across,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:10%
and thousands of
variations in between.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's how do you rectify
all of this variation?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
particular problem.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people sort
of have a general idea

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
what they think a
UFO is, until you

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
all the sightings

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes problematic.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come we don't
have that hard evidence?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We've got witness
testimony, but we just

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:90%
don't have that hard evidence.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask how you
describe hard evidence.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you take cases
like Bentwaters for instance,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:84%
there's one where
you have radiation.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You've got the pods, casts
of something physically

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The video evidence that comes
in now, people say, where is it?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.355 align:middle line:84%
Well, hell, it's coming
in basically weekly.

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:10.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Now, you do have a
problem because of digitization

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and what can be done with CGI.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But many of these cases
actually do stand up.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Los Alamos
National Laboratories.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:90%
What goes on there?

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Nuclear
weapons research.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.102 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's much
broader than that.

00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:29.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And?

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But
we were the ones

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
who brought the atomic bomb
and then did nuclear weapons.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But they study just a
breadth of technologies.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.408 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of things
are happening there.

00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%

and the fight against
improvised bombs

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.965 align:middle line:84%
marked recent highlights at
Los Alamos National Laboratory.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:58.649 align:middle line:90%
- The weapons program.

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
most modern warhead

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
in the US nuclear
arsenal, and deployed

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Navy's submarine fleet.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Work has begun on canceling
the war reserve W88

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
pit, the first W88
deliverable for this year.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The casting process
is new for the W88,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
the result of extensive
study and certification.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
In collaboration with Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos has
begun the transition

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
to manufacture W87 pits.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos is integrating
Livermore teams,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
working side by side
at Technical Area 55,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrating that
Los Alamos is indeed

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.455 align:middle line:84%
the nation's plutonium
center for excellence.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you're right, John.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things are
happening at Los Alamos.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
secretive in terms

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
of ufology going on there?

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Not to the
best of my knowledge.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've discussed with
many people, 7% to 10%

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of the population believe
they've seen a UFO.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Those numbers
are consistent with the US

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
government, with lab
employees and that,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
so you have many individuals
who have had some of them

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
pretty dramatic
personal experiences.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But that does not
transition to being

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:90%
an institutional responsibility.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And like you might expect
in a laboratory setting,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you run the gamut of belief
systems from yeah, I've seen it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
to this is total BS

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not going to waste time.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we seem to get
so many different varieties

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%
of UFO reports?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:10%
Like you just mentioned
the mile-long craft,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:10%
the small ones, the orbs.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.739 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
different concepts.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.538 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I have no idea.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the problem.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
issues when people

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
who want to study
UFOs and that, they're

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:84%
looking for some simplistic
answer, something one size

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
fits all.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Pulls all of the theories
together and that.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.326 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, it's just
not likely to happen.

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things I
point out is the phenomena that

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at-- and I would
take it to an even broader

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
context--

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is at least as complex as
cancer or AIDS, or that.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
You look at the amount of money
that we pour into research

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in those areas and
struggle for answers.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We spend almost nothing in
the areas of phenomenology

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
and studying that.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
probability of getting

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.525 align:middle line:90%
answers there are pretty slim.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The United
States at one point

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
was into Project Blue
Book, investigating UFOs.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Then they abruptly stopped
it with the Condon Report.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they stop?

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Oh, the
answer's quite simple.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:10%
They did not want to
screw with it anymore.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this was an
Air Force project.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:10%
And yes, you had people
who were assigned.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you had an
alternative detail.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You never had-- you had five
people in Blue Book itself.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But then bases had
officers who were

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%
responsible for doing reports.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And they just wanted
it to go away.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was noise
level kind of thing.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember that this
happened in '68, '69.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: If
you remember what's

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
world at that time,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Vietnam is about at its height.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Putting resources
into UFO research

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is a real distraction from--

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
between that and the
emphasis on the Cold War,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.015 align:middle line:84%
worrying what the Soviet
Union was likely to be doing.

00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
do Project Blue

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Book initially to appease
the United States citizens,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.044 align:middle line:84%
to basically tell them, we're
investigating this, folks?

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think--

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
well, initially if you go
back to the '47 era and those,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.123 align:middle line:84%
they were really
mystified, and also scared.

00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:47.206 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And scared, yeah.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.747 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Because
remember, in '52

00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
we had this flyover
in Washington, DC,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
sent jets up chasing
them and all of that,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and had no good answers for it.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But over time, this
went on and on, and on.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
You were not getting answers.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:90%
You were not getting a threat.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So from an, again,
institutional perspective,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to waste
resources on it.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go away.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of it was,
initially especially,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
to appease the public,
because they had questions.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:84%
How can these things be here
and flying around and doing

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.001 align:middle line:90%
strange things?

00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "War of the Worlds"
scared the heck out of people.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, and
again, the scare initially

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:10%
was that if it's not
us, maybe it's Soviet.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
if the Soviets have

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
some capability that supersedes
ours, that's a real threat.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But once that was
pretty well put to bed,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
no, it was just a
pain in the ass.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you seen a UFO?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yes.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the experience.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, first
one was pretty minuscule.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I was up at a ranch up in
the State of Washington

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.474 align:middle line:84%
and I watched this thing
come across the sky at night.

00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:03.015 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought it was a
satellite, and all of a sudden

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.009 align:middle line:90%
it just stopped.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.092 align:middle line:90%
And satellites don't stop.

00:08:05.092 --> 00:08:06.217 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I saw.

00:08:06.217 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I saw one of those too.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.527 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: The more recent
one was more dramatic, a case

00:08:10.527 --> 00:08:11.735 align:middle line:90%
that a number of people know.

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was with Chris Bledsoe.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:90%
And Chris had a phenomenal case.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and that went on and on.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I went down to visit him
in October of 2014 or '15.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was explaining
everything.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
We went down to the
river and he showed me

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
where things had happened.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where it was.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And we got
back up to his vehicle,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
just early evening,
just getting dark.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Light is significant here.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're leaning
against the car talking.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's pointing out where
various things happened

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden he says,
oh, I think they're here.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.556 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
within 10 seconds

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
this thing pops into view
and goes zipping off.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's a
temporal relationship

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
between him saying,
I think they're here,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and the object appearing that
certainly got my attention.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you baffled?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.585 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: If you mean,
do I have any answer,

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%
the answer is no.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it
got my attention.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we were also
back at his house and a lot

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of strange things happened.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
very complex set

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of phenomena that
happened there.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And saw some strange things
happen again near the house.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't a UFO per se.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But it said-- to me, it gave
me quite a bit of credibility

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.609 align:middle line:84%
to the case that
he was describing.

00:09:39.609 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, it's
obvious that they

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
are under some kind of
intelligent control.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you think?

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Some of them
certainly seem to be.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to respond when
they interact with a thing.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
We've had any number of
cases, for instance, where

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:90%
pilots have intercepted them.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:84%
We made the mistake, I think, of
shooting at them periodically.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Smart.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: You hear
Milton Torres case,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:90%
the great one over the UK.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Flies in.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:90%
He goes to ripple his missiles.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And in two seconds, the
UFO that was at a hover

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
has gone outside the
radar range of 250 miles.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how fast
you can calculate that,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but that's pretty damn fast.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is pretty fast.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And there have been some cases
where the UFOs have retaliated,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:90%
haven't they?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They've like gobbled
up an airplane

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and the plane's gone now.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: If you're talking
about the case in Australia,

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that's one where
we just don't know.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We have the pilot is
flying down to Tasmania

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and he's interacting with the
traffic control and saying,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I've got something
flying above me here.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.292 align:middle line:84%
And mid-sentence,
stops and never--

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's gone.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.916 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Never
heard him from again.

00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And they did
extensive searching,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
never found a debris field
or anything of that nature.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.655 align:middle line:90%
You have had--

00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:11.219 align:middle line:84%
I think the Iranian case is one
of the most fascinating one.

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the pilots.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Where the
fighters go in, they intercept.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
to me is the pilot said,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I was going to--

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.235 align:middle line:84%
as I got ready to
fire, all of a sudden

00:11:23.235 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
it shut down the
panels and whatnot.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
What was more of
interest, after they

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
turned away and
became a non-threat,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
electronics came back up again.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.295 align:middle line:10%
There's a guy who's worked a
lot in electronic warfare--

00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:10%
I had the tactical directed
energy programs for the Army

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:10%
at the time when I was--

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You did, yeah.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: ASCO.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And I know how to turn you off.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
What I don't know how to
turn you off and turn you

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:90%
back on again.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
that's a capability

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that would exceed anything
that's known even today.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that
tell you about what

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.075 align:middle line:90%
these craft could be?

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
again, I think

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
the problem is that
we're talking about them

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
as a single kind of
entity sort of thing.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a broad
range of phenomena,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.625 align:middle line:90%
even within the UFOs itself.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to extrapolate
to the larger scale,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to--
you know, I came up

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
with the term in a book called
the precognitive sentient

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
And that has to--

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:90%
You coined that phrase.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yes.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And that
came from watching

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Skinwalker Ranch and the
events that happened there.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think it has
applicability in this range.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I meant--
precognitive in that case,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
it, whatever it is,
knew how we were

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
going to respond even before
the phenomena were presented.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Sentient, it was
certainly smart.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And clearly a phenomenon.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And this gets to the
trickster, if you will.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, the
precognitive thing--

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
it was firmly in control.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what you're
seeing in the UFO phenomena

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
it is in control.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it want,
in your opinion, John?

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I don't--
well, again here,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it's
a they or want.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
What I look at, again in the
broader range of phenomenology,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is it looks like
human consciousness is

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
a piece of this.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
If you go back in history and
you look at what's happened

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
with UFOs, there's a classic
case from Jacques Vallée that I

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:90%
use.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And it took place
in the early 1900s.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The guy drives around a mountain
in the state of Washington.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, here's
this UFO hovering there

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and I can see every rivet.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
In early 1900s,
that makes sense.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who knew anything
about space travel

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
knows no way in hell
you'd use rivets.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
My point here is
that it seems to be

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
a step ahead of
our consciousness,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:90%
but not beyond belief.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is as it evolves and
our consciousness evolves,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of interaction
that, again, this gets back

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:90%
to terribly, terribly complex.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on all of that.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
People have in
some cases reported

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
seeing little occupants in
some of these craft as well.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Right.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they robots?

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they humanoids?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
again, I have no idea.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I point out

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is that throughout
human history,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:84%
we have had the reports of
interaction between humans

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:90%
and sentient non-human beings.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Every culture in the
world has described

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:90%
So it continues in ours.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's fairly recent
that we've added, oh,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
by the way, they came in
in a UFO, if you will,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%
or a flying craft.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Before, they just appeared.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
People went into the mountains.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
"Rip Van Winkle"

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and these kind of things.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And again, not unique.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot
of time in Hawaii.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the Menehune,
the little people who

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
construct things and you
find physical structures

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
that occur after that.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you want to do it again
from a practical standpoint,

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
if you were going to go out--
and it is what we are doing

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in space exploration early on--

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.584 align:middle line:90%
robots make a lot of sense.

00:15:27.584 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, they do.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Especially.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: When you look at
what's happening in warfare,

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
drones if you will, dirty,
dull, and dangerous.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You can send those
kinds of things out.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The price you pay
for human exploration

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and what you have to do from
a technological standpoint,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:90%
the monetary--

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
we value human
life, so you've got

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to have secondary,
tertiary, you know,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
backup systems for survival.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
A robot, you don't have
to worry about that.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's frankly, if
you were a foreign entity

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial entity in
this case, sending a thing in,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
practical way to do it.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Where might they be coming from.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I know this is all
speculation, but obviously

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
do you think they're
within our solar system?

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallée,
whom you've quoted,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
believes these are
dimensional craft.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.806 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would like
to believe they're

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
coming from other planetary
systems in our universe.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.815 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, the
first question of course

00:16:27.815 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
is, is there sentient
life in the universe?

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is absolutely.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's not speculation.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:90%
That's just pure numbers.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
The number of-- in
the recent decades,

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.316 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the number
of inhabitable planets

00:16:41.316 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding--
now, we were

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:90%
guessing three decades ago.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that there are
out in the hundreds of billions

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of inhabitable,
Earth-like planets that

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
are out there, which says
there ought to be sentient life

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
someplace out there who would
also be doing space exploration

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and coming here.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Jacques and I are
actually very close.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, he did the
forward for my book.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason on that.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is, again, you get back
to the role of consciousness,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that there seems to be some
role in here that allows

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
things to appear and disappear.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Many of the phenomena
that we talk about--

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:84%
this is the case,
particularly where things just

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:90%
disappear and appear--

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
would suggest a
multi-dimensional reality.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly is, again from
a pure scientific perspective,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot easier to transit the
parallel dimensions right

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
here than it is
to have warp speed

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and be able to do
superluminal travel that

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
would be necessary
to do this even

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
within the solar system, let
alone intergalactic kinds

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%
of travel.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jacques Vallée was
highlighted in the movie "Close

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:10%
Encounters of the Third Kind"
as the Frenchman, right?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Right.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of a kind.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
He's been at the forefront
of investigations

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:90%
for so many years.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
As you just mentioned,
you're a friend of his.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any doubts,
John, any doubts at all

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO
phenomenon is not real?

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Absolutely not.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Put that in a positive frame.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.727 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely real.

00:18:28.727 --> 00:18:29.934 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is the real deal.

00:18:29.934 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: There's
no doubt about that.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are
seeing something.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: They're
seeing things--

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The big
question is from where.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.886 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: They're
definitely seeing things.

00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely
having interaction

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:90%
with sentient non-human beings.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
How that comes about and
the parameters of it,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that's why I keep arguing we
need to make it permissible

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
for serious scientists to
study this without risking

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:90%
their reputation or livelihood.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
we don't do that.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben Rich from
Lockheed Skunk Works

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:90%
has talked about technologies.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But he says that
we are so advanced,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's all in the
Black Ops projects.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well--

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.674 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that true?

00:19:12.674 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Let's be clear.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Ben Rich was a friend of mine.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.308 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
most of the things

00:19:17.308 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you're describing comes
from the extrapolation

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of a short presentation
that somebody heard once.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.246 align:middle line:84%
We sat down and discussed
this in considerable detail.

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You and Ben.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Several times.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, you know,
he had a shopping list.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, if this is real, I
want their propulsion system,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I want this, I
want that, do that.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Do they have
advanced technology?

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.894 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I point to,

00:19:44.894 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
advanced technology, what's

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
the most advanced system
that we have right today?

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It's probably the F-35.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.372 align:middle line:84%
And look at the
technological problems

00:19:54.372 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%
we have bringing that--

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.371 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they have
oxygen issues with it now.

00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Burt Rutan was just at the
house, and we were discussing--

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.607 align:middle line:90%
you know, he's a great aviator--

00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and discussing that.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And he goes,
eh, that's old technology.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You're just kind of
kludging things together.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I fail to see any big
leaps in technology.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, you have been
an expert in remote viewing.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for years as one
of the foremost remote viewer

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:90%
experts.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I think
that's a bit of a stretch.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Take the credit
when credit's due.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, there was a film called
"The Men Who Stare at Goats."

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
It was based about
a true story which

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.885 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk with you about.

00:20:37.885 --> 00:20:38.685 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:42.982 align:middle line:84%
- What you're saying is
that you were a psychic spy?

00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:45.732 align:middle line:90%
- A Jedi warrior.

00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
- I'd heard that the US
government was training

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
psychic soldiers, and
that Lyn Cassidy was

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.449 align:middle line:90%
the best of the best.

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:90%
- I've been re-activated.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a mission.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:90%
- I could come.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.955 align:middle line:84%
Lyn's story was unbelievable,
crazy, and completely true.

00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:10%
- You have to dream
a new America that

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:10%
no longer has an exploitative
view of everyone.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.126 align:middle line:90%
You will be a psychic weapon!

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.902 align:middle line:90%
Feel it, yes.

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:14.485 align:middle line:84%
We must create warrior monks
who can pass through walls

00:21:14.485 --> 00:21:16.157 align:middle line:90%
and see into the future.

00:21:16.157 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
- Congratulations, Scotty.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%
- Thank you.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.993 align:middle line:84%
- Sorry it doesn't work
out between you two.

00:21:19.993 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
bring back memories?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know-- in fact, I've
done a whole write-up on it,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:90%
what's real and what's not real.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I might point out that the
last one was ostensibly

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
General Stubblebine, who
unfortunately died 6 February

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of this year and did not
try to run through walls.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The problem that I
saw is Jon Ronson

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.324 align:middle line:84%
took about this much truth
and he wrote this much.

00:21:45.324 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he expanded it.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.165 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And then
they made the movie.

00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.715 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: You can find--

00:21:49.715 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine how
badly they extrapolated.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.434 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we did have a
government program like that.

00:21:56.434 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, we had
the remote viewing program

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
if that's what
you're referring to.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: The goats
program, there were goats

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and they actually died.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But none of them
were from staring.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It was from a technology
called dim mak, which

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:90%
is a martial arts form.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got-- actually on
my web site I have listed

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
here's what's real and
what's not real and--

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.095 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:22:20.095 --> 00:22:22.344 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But tell me about
the remote viewing program.

00:22:22.344 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Why did we really get into that?

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Was it because of the Soviets?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: That was
a big piece of it, yes.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's a book
called "ESP Wars East & West"

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:10%
that's out.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of interesting,
because you had participants

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:10%
from both sides write it up.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In fairness, we were
concerned about the work

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.761 align:middle line:90%
that the Soviets--

00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:46.926 align:middle line:84%
remember, this was the old
days of the Soviet Union.

00:22:46.926 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Cold War too.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And they
were pursuing this fairly

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:90%
rigorously.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
host of things--

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:90%
SRI was critically involved.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You had Hal Puthoff
and Russ Targ

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
who came up with the program.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had three
remote viewers

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:90%
who worked with them initially.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:10%
It was Ingo Swann, Pat Price,
and Hella Hammid, all of which

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:10%
are now deceased.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:10%
And they had run a series
of programs that said--

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:10%
or experiments and said,
yeah, they could obviously

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:10%
get information this way.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Joe McMoneagle, of course, who
is Remote Viewer 001 and has

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:90%
done--

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, I guess one of
the premier ones

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
was seeing the work with
a Soviet submarine, where

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.275 align:middle line:90%
he was asked to look at a site.

00:23:38.275 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
He had the geographic
coordinates

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and described a big building.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they went back
and said, describe

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:90%
what's in the building.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.385 align:middle line:84%
And he described-- he says,
well, there's some submarine.

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
One of them's really, really big
and is dramatically different.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The tubes are
forward of the sail,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
a procedure we've
never seen before.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Described double
hull and all that.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So the information
went to the submarine

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
scientists, who kind
of laughed and said,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
nah, you couldn't do
that, because if you

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:84%
build a submarine that
big, when it went to depth

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:90%
it would crush.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Sure enough,
shortly thereafter the clouds

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:10%
parted and cameras
came on and there

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:10%
was a big ass submarine, became
known as the Typhoon class.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
number of attributes

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:32.380 align:middle line:84%
that Joe had directly
and correctly

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.664 align:middle line:84%
correlated with it, which
took us totally by surprise.

00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does
remote viewing allow

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
you to look into the future as
well, or is it just real-time?

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Oh no.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's a
classic experiment

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:10%
that was done by Bob
Jahn at Princeton.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:10%
You know, he and Brenda
Dunn were doing work there.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's one where they
had a person was going out

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and they had the remote
viewer describe the target.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And the person was
traveling to Europe.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:84%
They did the description
of the target.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a specific bridge
in Czechoslovakia.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And they described it.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And the target had not
even been selected yet.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: There were
a series of targets.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: So the target
hadn't been selected.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The person went there, and a
very, very high correlation

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
between the information that was
done 24 hours before the target

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:84%
was even selected, let alone
them knowing about the target.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing feat,
remote viewing, allowing you

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:90%
to glance at things.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:90%
What's its sole purpose, though?

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it's
really set up for?

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, again,
we're back to complexity,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
because the things
I've described so far

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
have been very
accurately described

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:90%
details and experiments.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.974 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:59.974 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: What the
community doesn't like to talk

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
about is the
spectacular failures,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
where you get information that
turns out to be really wrong.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.966 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
have been some.

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: For
instance, there's

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
a number of people who make
consistent claims, particularly

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
with law enforcement--
they went out.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, some law
enforcement agencies

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:84%
will use remote
viewers or psychics.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Others just want
them to stay away,

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
because they muck up
the investigation,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:90%
having had so many wrong.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, in my view,
one of signal to noise.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is one that we
have not yet conquered.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is, how
do you determine

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
when you're getting accurate
information versus information

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:90%
that is inaccurate?

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I think part of the problem
in dealing with the future

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.449 align:middle line:84%
is the future may not
be fully determined.

00:26:53.449 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's changeable.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And if you think
of it is a collapsing wave

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.816 align:middle line:84%
function, there
are certain things

00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that have to happen
for the future

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
that you see to
happen accurately.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And if all of those things
don't fall into place,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:90%
then a different future emerges.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are-- it's
hard to even wrap your mind

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:90%
around the possibilities.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
science behind this, John?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I think so.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's one that's not
understood and not studied.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
not studied is,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
A, just from a
fiscal standpoint,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to make
a lot of money at it,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and that you know, it's not
good for your career in general

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to study in these areas,
because, well, you may know,

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Scientific American attacked
me ad hominem, and--

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Unjustifiably so, by the way.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:90%
We support you.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, it could be.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But the point was
that their problem

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
with what I was
discussing ostensibly

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.085 align:middle line:84%
was because I have
interests in these areas.

00:28:06.085 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
to note, the topic

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
non-lethal weapons.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to
do with the topic

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.262 align:middle line:90%
that they were using to attack.

00:28:14.262 --> 00:28:15.061 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And so other
scientists look at these things

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and they've seen people
who have been burned.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
If you get too far
outside your field,

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
you can get burned
rather seriously.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of hate out there.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.525 align:middle line:84%
Have we used remote viewing
to try to kill someone?

00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, you'd
have to describe "we."

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody?

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.711 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you get into--

00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "We" as a government.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.379 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
let's extrapolate

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:84%
a bit into other fields,
because, you know,

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing has really been
around, again, for millennia.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
This has been used by
militaries to prognosticate--

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Shamans.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --battles and
see things, and shamans

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:90%
So those are very real.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You certainly do-- if
you take it out of--

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any government
remote viewers, at least

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
US government remote viewers,
have used this to adversely

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.444 align:middle line:90%
affect individuals.

00:29:17.444 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think they've
tried to enter somebody's dream

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
state with remote viewing or in
dreams, or anything like that.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I can't
speak to any-- any individual.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
now-- remember, the program

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:90%
ended in '95.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And you now have
the second and third generation

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
derivatives of the various
people who became--

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.810 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
the martial arts,

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
where you have my instructor
set up this procedure

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and passed it on.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.695 align:middle line:90%
Has somebody gone out there?

00:29:45.695 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's quite possible.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I see no evidence, A,
that it's been done,

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
or B, that it's been successful.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
earlier that there is

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:84%
a difficulty ascertaining the
difference between what is

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:84%
happening, what is
real, and what isn't.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:90%
How do they know that?

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing a
remote viewing session,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and maybe sketching
or drawing, how

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
do you know that the brain
isn't just creating this stuff?

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, one of the
things that was determined

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
early on was the necessity
for observation at some point,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
The human consciousness would
interact with the target

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and would actually be able
to see that and verify

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:90%
the validity of it.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's why you have the
remote viewing where

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
they do try to predict
futures for stock market

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't view the stock market.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:84%
What they view is an alternative
object that represents

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:90%
is it moving up or down?

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, what this is
raising is a whole series

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.146 align:middle line:84%
of very, very
fascinating questions,

00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and ones that I
don't think we're

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:84%
doing an adequate
job in exploring.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing how this
happens and how this works.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.107 align:middle line:84%
How does it work, because
we know it does happen?

00:31:07.107 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, therein the--

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:31:09.273 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: This has been
the catch-22, if you will,

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:84%
particularly if you go from
a scientific perspective.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:84%
One early on was guessing that
it was an electromagnetic kind

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The brain went out
there and saw things.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a radio wave.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.439 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But the issue that
you raised a short time ago,

00:31:30.439 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:84%
when it says, I'm going
to perturbate time,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that can not be accommodated by
any of the models that we have.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.546 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: So there are
people who have proposed things,

00:31:42.546 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but we have just not done
adequate research and following

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:90%
up on it.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We started off
this discussion, John,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:90%
talking about UFOs.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we talk
about remote viewing.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection
between those two at all?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I think it's
much, much broader than--

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I have a slide that I
use in all of my presentations

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:90%
on these topics.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And it has not only UFOs,
but near-death experiences,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.497 align:middle line:90%
healings, psychokinesis, and--

00:32:13.497 --> 00:32:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all tied together.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.582 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --even
cryptozoology, if you will,

00:32:19.582 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot and things like that.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I think there is a connection.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that
the connection has

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to do with consciousness,
and human consciousness

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:90%
as a part of that.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And human
consciousness, does it

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:90%
exist without the brain?

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Absolutely.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the-- the
whole brain-mind duality

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is one of the things that
has perplexed the field.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, Larry Dossey
wrote a book originally

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
called "One Mind."

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
we're talking there

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:84%
about the interconnectedness
of everything.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to think that
that's probably right.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is the thing that
looks like it comes closest

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:84%
to explaining all
of these phenomena

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.332 align:middle line:90%
that we have been discussing.

00:33:07.332 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you, though?

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
the connection of ESP,

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:84%
precognition, UFOs,
remote viewing,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences,
what does that

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
tell you about the
broadness of the universe?

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.614 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:33:23.614 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I think it says

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that our model of the
universe, if you're

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at the Western view
of a materialistic universe,

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.850 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You know,
materialistic says, I'm

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
going to cut smaller
and smaller pieces

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get to the
basic building block.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And if you look
at what we've put into it--

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I use this as the
economic argument as well.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Large Hadron
Collider, which is used.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: CERN.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: We put $18
billion into that research

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
looking for what is,
quote, the "God particle."

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Higgs boson came up.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They said
they found it.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But
shortly after that,

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden we said,
whoops, there's pentaquarks.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
You know, we
thought we had the--

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:10.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:10.459 --> 00:34:11.959 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
every time we look,

00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:84%
we keep finding there's
more and more and more.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
None of this, however, gets to
explanations of things-- again,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
we start pertubating time.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You find things with energy
sources that just cannot be

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:90%
explained.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In my next book, I talk about
things that can't happen

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
but did, and they're
all first-hand.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And the things that
I have seen happen--

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, levitation, apports,
things of that nature,

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.437 align:middle line:84%
you go, where did the
energy come from--

00:34:43.437 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did it come from?

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: --that
allows this to happen?

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot come up with
a classic material view.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
get these answers?

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: No.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
think so either.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I have something

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it
called Alexander's

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:90%
law of appropriate complexity.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.485 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is everybody--

00:35:06.485 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
talking about you,

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.770 align:middle line:84%
John Alexander as opposed
to Alexander Graham

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Bell or something like that.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.161 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: No, this
applies to everybody.

00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is at some level
of understanding complexity

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:90%
in their life and getting along.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is
just about the time

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that you think you've
got the answers,

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
a whole new dimension
opens up and you find out,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm back at
square one, starting up

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:90%
on the next level of complexity.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're probably
infinite, and ones that

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:90%
definitely need exploration.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.164 align:middle line:84%
And we need serious scientists
to be involved in this.

00:35:40.164 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked
about consciousness.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
extraterrestrials.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that these
beings have the ability

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:90%
to tap into our consciousness?

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: They may
be our consciousness.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may be.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, if we
believe, as I happen to,

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:84%
that the entire universe
is totally interconnected,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:90%
then they are us.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they may be even
created by us or pieces of it.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, terribly
complex, but certainly

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
consciousness plays a role
crosscutting everything.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does spirituality
get involved in any of this?

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It's
fundamental to it.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:84%
One of my-- in fact, the
last line in the book

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
now is that you're a
spiritual being having

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, I've worked with
shamans all over the world.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
that we have in the West

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is we tend to not
like things spiritual.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet the cultures that I've
worked with around the world,

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.534 align:middle line:90%
this is a common factor.

00:36:48.534 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about around the world,

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.090 align:middle line:84%
there are some
societies and religions

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.554 align:middle line:90%
that actually believe in this.

00:36:55.554 --> 00:36:56.402 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:56.402 --> 00:36:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Candomblé,
the deities are referred

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.919 align:middle line:90%
to as orishas.

00:36:59.919 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds
of them reflecting

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.712 align:middle line:84%
different manifestations of
God, like fire, water, or war.

00:37:05.712 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:84%
- When the orishas come to
Earth through their followers,

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:90%
they dance.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that the actual
deity, it comes to the Earth

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:84%
through that body of that
person, which for us is

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
something very good, because
we are able to engage

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:90%
with our deities.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that happened
to be Afro-Brazilian.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: That's Candomblé.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: No.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.600 align:middle line:90%
We have been there.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.770 align:middle line:90%
We've attended ceremonies.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one that we had, we
were at an Umbanda ceremony

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:90%
in Curitiba in Brazil.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:84%
My wife actually
became possessed.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.256 align:middle line:90%
Right in front of you?

00:37:47.256 --> 00:37:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And this
was a serious thing.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
was that we were

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:84%
at a very large ceremony,
about 300 people there,

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:84%
but only about 10 gringos
that were in there.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And the lead high priestess
said, does anybody

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.790 align:middle line:90%
want healing.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And Victoria stood in front
of her and put her hands up

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.539 align:middle line:84%
and the story says something
just jumped into her.

00:38:10.539 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jumped right into her.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Took over her body.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And for
the next 15 minutes

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.559 align:middle line:84%
or so, she's out whirling
and literally stop the show.

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.835 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yes.

00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting, because
I was taking a picture.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I didn't
have a movie camera.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of stills
and have posted them.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're used to seeing--

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're not used to seeing
a gringo out there, you know,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.260 align:middle line:90%
totally possessed.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doing what
they're doing, yeah.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.459 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And of course,
they came over to me

00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and said, why are you taking it?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Are you a reporter?

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:90%
That's my wife.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.080 align:middle line:90%
And they go, she'll be OK.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And I use Brazil as kind
of a classic example,

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
because I deal with Brazilians
at very, very high levels

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:90%
in technical matters in Brazil.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're educated in Western
society and institutions,

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:90%
and accept that.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:10%
Conversely, they also
accept spiritism,

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:10%
which is-- this is one of the
spiritist religions down there.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.968 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they're into it.

00:39:10.968 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I've
seen John of God,

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:90%
for instance, in Abadiania.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great healer.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And yeah, in my
view, that's the real deal.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
like I say, we've

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:90%
been there a couple of times.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And you just cannot explain.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll raise
the complex issue.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Last time we were there
was about two years ago.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And we saw the people were
now coming in busloads.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Used to be a few hundred.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now there are
thousands of people.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.044 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thousands.

00:39:41.044 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Everybody who
came in a wheelchair left

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:90%
in a wheelchair.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So my question then is, why is
it that some people get healed

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.657 align:middle line:90%
and others don't?

00:39:50.657 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And others don't.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And
these I think are--

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:90%
it absolutely happens.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:90%
But how do we explain that?

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, are they
healing themselves, John?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Do they have this belief
system where they take care

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, and then
some of the others can't?

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, we're
into basic belief systems

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the answer would be, I'm
not sure, because again, you

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:90%
have experiences.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard John talk to
people and say, I can heal you.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to raise
another dimension here.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.756 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And that is
the issue of reincarnation.

00:40:27.756 --> 00:40:30.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, but if I
heal you in this life,

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
you have a karmic
debt that you're going

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:90%
to have to pay in some others.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: So
you probably ought

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to proceed now and pay
the debt and get that off.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing's free.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.984 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER:
Others-- like I say,

00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
we have Wayne Dyer is kind of
the classic example in there.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was healed
remotely and of leukemia.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Dramatic effects showed up very
shortly after an intervention

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.070 align:middle line:90%
by John of God in Abadiania.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.374 align:middle line:90%
But he's in Hawaii at the time.

00:41:05.374 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
an amazing-- yeah.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.370 align:middle line:90%
God rest Wayne Dyers' soul.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: He died
of a heart failure.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:11.506 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:11.506 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Not the leukemia.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Nothing
to do with leukemia.

00:41:13.065 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not the
leukemia, right.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.573 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: The
leukemia been healed.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the wife become
de-possessed when that finally

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.747 align:middle line:90%
ended for her?

00:41:20.747 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well
one of the questions

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we had from friends
when we came back

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:84%
was, well, did you bring
something back with you?

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: We hope not.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.740 align:middle line:84%
No, she just went on the
side and kind of slowly

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:90%
"came back," if you will.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.690 align:middle line:90%
But it was very, very dramatic.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you could tell
it was very different.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be scary.

00:41:42.468 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Now, she's
had a lot of experiences.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, we've been
in other ceremonies,

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.010 align:middle line:84%
like in Vitoria, where
we've attended other Umbanda

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies, and
there's something

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:90%
about where they recognize her.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.415 align:middle line:84%
They look at us
kind of strangely

00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:84%
as foreigners coming into
the favelas and doing it.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they know her.

00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But pretty soon,
she gets recognized and--

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our late friend, Apollo
14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell--

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Ed Mitchell.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.232 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --puts a lot
of us into perspective.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our early
investors in noetics almost 40

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.240 align:middle line:90%
years ago asked me--

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
told me, Edgar, I
would like for you

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to investigate this
very question of what

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:90%
happens when we die.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, I would be
delighted to investigate

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.057 align:middle line:84%
and understand what happens
to consciousness when we die.

00:42:37.057 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
I've got to find out

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
what consciousness
is, because we do not

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
know in scientific terms,
at least, what it is.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:90%
We know we're all conscious.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:51.330 align:middle line:84%
We know that-- we're now knowing
that most all matter, living

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:90%
matter, is conscious.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness even
goes down into what

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:90%
we consider non-living matter.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:90%
It starts in the quantum world.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.382 align:middle line:90%
We're quite sure of that.

00:43:01.382 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was one of a kind.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Absolutely.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, he
had an amazing healing

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.250 align:middle line:84%
from prostate cancer
as well early on,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.180 align:middle line:90%
so he'd had personal experience.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But again, interesting there,
his son also died of that well

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:84%
before him, and again
didn't get healed,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:90%
even though they tried to.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That was a sad episode for him.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But he brings up an
interesting point

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that I want to
wrap up with, John.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what
is consciousness?

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.520 align:middle line:90%
What does this all mean?

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I don't know.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.944 align:middle line:90%
You got any simple questions?

00:43:39.944 --> 00:43:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, really.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: The
problem is, again, we

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
get back to we're dealing
with something that

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.840 align:middle line:90%
is terribly, terribly complex.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER:
Possibly unknowable.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But real.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Absolutely real.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
about the reality.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.570 align:middle line:10%
And again, I think
what behooves us would

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:10%
be to get into and study--

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:08.080 align:middle line:10%
by the way, we've been
talking in phenomenology here,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of my writing on
national and international

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.270 align:middle line:10%
security kinds of issues.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:84%
These have global implications
from a strategic standpoint.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:23.080 align:middle line:84%
If we start looking at if
all of human consciousness

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is interconnected and all
of us are part of there

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and you are your
brother's keeper,

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.039 align:middle line:84%
what does this say about our
foreign policy, for instance?

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Thank you.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is mind-perplexing.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.470 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:90%
What does it all mean?

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.390 align:middle line:10%
We may never get the answers.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.250 align:middle line:10%
But with people
like John Alexander,

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:10%
we will continue to explore.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:52.120 align:middle line:84%
With programs like Beyond Belief
we will continue to probe.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day we'll
find out a little bit more

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:84%
about the mysteries
of the universe.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
