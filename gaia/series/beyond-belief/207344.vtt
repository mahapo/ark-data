collective consciousness that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:90%
is a group mind.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It works through common
values and common vision.

can be a grouping

>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That is why we as
individuals need

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to have a spiritual path
which helps us to understand

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:90%
ourselves first and foremost.

control the masses

of thought process?

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's its goal.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The egregores
we're talking about

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
seek to control you
as an individual.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they seek to have
your individuality subsumed

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
into the whole, into the mass.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Your identity is no longer
you as yourself, but you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.815 align:middle line:90%
as "I am a part of that."

00:00:56.815 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if we get your
attention, we get your mind.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
If we get your mind,
we get your energy.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So if I have your attention,
and I have your energy,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%

to influence.

It's great to be here.

>>NOORY: Tell me
a little bit more.

00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in all this spirituality?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, I
grew up around it.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:10%
I had family members who
were involved in esotericism

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:10%
coming from their days in Europe
and here in the United States.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And I had a great uncle
who was deeply involved

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:10%
in all of the major esoteric
movements of the 20th century.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:10%
And since he died
in his 90s, that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:10%
meant he had an
experience which spanned

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:10%
the entire 20th century.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was just wonderful to
be around that environment

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.975 align:middle line:84%
of openness and
investigation and developing

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:10.868 align:middle line:84%
a personal understanding of what
religion and spirituality mean.

>>NOORY: Did you have
some help, or did you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.847 align:middle line:90%
do this all on your own?

00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: No, I had many
wonderful teachers, some

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of them, of course,
which I knew personally,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
like my great uncle,
and others which

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I would go to-- some seminars or
authors which I'd met and known

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

they try to teach you?

>>STAVISH: Really, to
become independent,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to become
self-reliant, to, as it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
says over the Temple of Apollo
at Delphi in ancient Greece,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:90%
"know thyself."

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%

And that's a big question.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.417 align:middle line:84%
But know thyself--
that was the focus.

thrust of your books,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and they're all amazing.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
You would say under what kind
of umbrella would they be?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, we would
call it Western esotericism,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
meaning focusing on those
spiritual traditions--

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
alchemy, Kabbalah,
astrology, mysticism--

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that one sees mostly in the
Mediterranean and Western

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Europe.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.483 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to give
it a more concise term--

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you want to call
it "hermeticism,"

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:90%
that might be too limiting.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:90%
But it is just that--

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the path of inner
initiation, inner awakening,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
how to come to know
yourself and bring

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
that forth into your life.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
term called "egregore."

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: An egregore is--

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:90%
well, it's a complex term.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It means "watcher."

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is a
collective consciousness,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:90%
that is, a group mind.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of an individual?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
it's always a group.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It can start with
an individual who

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
has a religious or
philosophical idea,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
or as we'll see later,
maybe even a business idea.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But it attracts other people
to it who want to be involved.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But exactly
what does it do?

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It limits
the focus of the group.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you join a religion
or a political party,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
it has ideas and
goals and aspirations.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And it moves you
along to conform

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to those ideas and
goals and aspirations

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.703 align:middle line:90%
to achieve its goals.

00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when
you say "it," it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
gives me the assumption
it's some kind of entity

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.285 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's
the great question.

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
In modern terms, we
would think of it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
as just kind of an amorphous
collective attitude.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the classical world,
it was seen as an "It,"

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual being itself,
which you were willingly

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
attaching yourself to and
had a relationship with.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a thought form?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it can
start as a thought form,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
but it grows, because it
grows beyond the individual.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
An example would
be like you and I.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We have an aspiration,
whether it's to have a show

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
or write a book or do
something for physical health

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and wellness.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And we create an idea
around that, a thought form,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%
of our goal.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But we often don't involve
other people in that.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.805 align:middle line:90%
We can do that on our own.

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
thought form which

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
grows beyond the individual and
takes on a wider aspiration.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
People are drawn to it to
help support it and bring it

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:90%
into realization.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me an example
of how this would function.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: A political party--

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
National Socialism, Communism.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.933 align:middle line:84%
It all started with ideas in
the mind of one human being,

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and there you have it.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
would be an egregore?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That would be an
egregore because they're still

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
around today.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though National Socialism
was defeated in 1945,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
we still constantly
feel its presence.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Communism collapsed more
or less in the 1990s,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%
and we still feel its influence.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it could be good.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.593 align:middle line:90%
It could be bad.

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
that's the point.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you join a
group-- and that's

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.993 align:middle line:90%
really what we're talking about.

00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Your grandmother said, you're
known by the company you keep.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
studies have shown

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
you will become like the five
people you spend the most

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:90%
time with.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Now that's an egregore.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Whether we want to think of it
as such or not, it becomes one.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
are helping the community and
seeking to improve themselves

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And that can be very
beneficial to you.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Or you can join a group which--

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
well, you may think it's good.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.842 align:middle line:84%
But it leads you down
a path of suffering.

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, if
you were in a bar

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and sat down next to somebody
and said, "I'm an egregore,"

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:90%
they'd probably throw you out.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.388 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They would because
I wouldn't say that term.

00:06:19.388 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wouldn't
understand it.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Right.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
beauty of the term.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
All of your listeners have
heard the idea of a group mind.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
we're talking about.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The term "egregore"
didn't really

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
gain a lot of traction
in popular culture

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
until recently, even
though we do see it

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in the writings
of the occultists

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of the 19th and 20th century.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But mostly we see
the term "group mind"

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
or "group consciousness."

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So if we use
that as a substitute term,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
we're going to understand
what an egregore is.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We can wrap our
minds around that.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the group mind,
the collective consciousness,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:84%
as we call it,
what makes it work?

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Oh, I don't know.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
the question, isn't it?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:10%
But somehow, just as
our own subconscious

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:10%
takes all of our-- experiences
it and organizes it for us.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It synthesizes it into a whole.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, when you get a
lot of people together,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're working towards
a common goal or aspiration,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a synthesis of their
different minds and attitudes.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.707 align:middle line:90%
It creates common values.

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
That might be the thing
we could say how it works.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It works through common
values and common vision.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you form an
egregore the way you want it?

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would you do that?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, a typical
example would be in business.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
You have an idea for a business.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:90%
You give it a logo.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You give it a name.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
You have a slogan.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you start bringing
people in and employees.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's doing very well.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you start to
take that business,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, who
is our ideal employee?

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Who is our ideal customer?

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, a perfect example
would that be in the '50s--

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the IBM man.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
They all wore-- the man
in the gray flannel suit.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And they all wear the
same suit, the same tie,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:90%
the same white shirt.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
That would be a very good
example of an egregore forming

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
over time, where everyone
begins to conform to its-- not

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
only views of what
the business is about,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
but how they as a person, as
an individual, should appear.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far back
does that term go, Mark?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
I think we could

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.897 align:middle line:84%
say it goes back to
the Classical Period

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
because we do see it in
some ancient literature.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it appears in the
Ethiopian "Book of Enoch"

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and in other places.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
And of course, clearly
in those writings,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
it relates to an egregore
as being a living

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
entity between us here on
Earth and a spiritual being

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or beings somewhere
in the invisible.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are egregores
formed or created?

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, I think
they can occur organically

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
when people become acting.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think
traditionally we see them

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
as being created--
that at some point

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
the idea is, I want to connect
with these invisible forces,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
whatever God or deity that
may be or be perceived of.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And then religions start.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Rituals start.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Cults start.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part
of it because there

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
has to be repeated
action and repeated

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:90%
feeding of the egregore.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Now we say, what
does it feed on?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's emotions
and devotion.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say social
networking is an egregore?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It has the
potential to be one.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.605 align:middle line:90%
I think we see a lot of it.

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we see egregores working
through social networking.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I jokingly say that the internet
is kind of the subconscious

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
mind or the projection
of the subconscious mind

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
into reality, into
the physical world,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's thoughts and
ideas can just instantly appear

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So we see the internet
and social media

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
as being the tools
whereby people

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
like to have their ideas seeded
into the popular consciousness.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's a mechanism for it.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
control the masses

00:09:58.193 --> 00:09:59.735 align:middle line:84%
through this kind
of thought process?

00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's its goal.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Now those masses may
be a small group.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It may just be those who are
devoted to it, like a religion

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.160 align:middle line:90%
or in a small area.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think when we
look at mass media

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:90%
now, that desire for control--

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and this is my personal belief--

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I believe is near global.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We saw what
happened during Nazi Germany

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
in World War II.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Was that an egregore?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Perfect
example of one,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
yes, through that constant
controlling of the media.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's a social
control mechanism,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
which means it seeks to control
your thoughts, your ideas.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we're
studying engineering,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that's fine, because we need
to limit what we focus on.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It seeks to control
your words, which

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is fine, because we need
specific engineering

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
terms to communicate.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And your actions--
you need to do

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
things that make you a better
engineer or a sports player,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
whatever that happens to be.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we move into
the broader arena of you

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:84%
as an individual, the
egregores we're talking about

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
seek to control you
as an individual.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they seek to have
your individuality subsumed

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
into the whole, into the mass.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Your identity is no longer
you as yourself, but you

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:90%
as "I am a part of that."

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It becomes your
whole identity, which

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
is what we saw in Nazi Germany,
which we saw in Communism.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And having grown
up around people

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
who survived the Nazi period
and the Soviet period,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't say that loosely.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I say that as a matter of fact.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
know what's happening

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to them when they get involved
in that kind of a situation?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: No.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And the reason being--

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They get
pulled in, don't they?

00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, your
idealism, your emotions,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.655 align:middle line:90%
are what are used against you.

00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
What we see now is many people
being sold a bill of goods

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
around Utopian ideas.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
That's as old as the hills.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wants a better world.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:90%
The question is, how?

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The devil, as they
say, is in the details.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're told everything
will improve your life,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it's this political
party, whether it's

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
this religion, or whether
it's this product that we're

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:90%
telling you to buy.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:90%
This will make your life better.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's your
emotional connection

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to this that is what
is used against you

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.775 align:middle line:90%
and that pulls you in.

00:12:11.775 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.973 align:middle line:84%
Mark, about the masses
that get pulled in?

00:12:15.973 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: People want
meaning in their lives,

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and an egregore is a
prepackaged meaning.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it could
be any organization?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be any kind
of a phrase that's

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
happening today, whether it's
opposed to the police or not?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
People tend to jump
on the bandwagon,

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and it grows, and it festers.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it does, too?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Exactly.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying not
to have ideals.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
not to be idealistic.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That is, have good
aspirations for yourself,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
but realize people are people
and that what is good for you

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:90%
may not be good for others.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we try to have
a one size fits all,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
which is what many of
these social entities do--

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and is, again, social
entities that we're seeing.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to be social
movements and social control.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
That's when you have to say,
OK, is this good for me.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who determines
what's good and what's not?

00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's the point.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
You as an individual have
to look at your engagement

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
with everyone and say, you know,
I like being part of this VFW.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I like being part of
this library book club.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I like being part of this--

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
about a hate group?

00:13:24.862 --> 00:13:27.112 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, people go
to hate groups because they

00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:90%
think it's good for them.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.402 align:middle line:84%
They think that they're
going to benefit from it.

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember, their
notion of what is good

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is what is driving them
forward to that membership.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
How you get them to
understand that violence

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and anger and aggression
are not good for them--

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
that's a difficult
haul, because what

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
you have now is a
large-scale example

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of a co-dependent relationship.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.042 align:middle line:90%
These are their family now.

00:13:56.042 --> 00:13:57.625 align:middle line:84%
People who are
involved in this-- this

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.572 align:middle line:90%
is not unlike organized crime.

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Someone would join
organized crime,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and they'd get a new name, or
a gang, they get a new name.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:90%
This becomes their family.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So getting people out of that,
or cult extraction, which--

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
therapies-- are very difficult
and demanding, because people

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:90%
now have to have an identity.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
How do to identify
if I'm not marching

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:90%
on the street for this cause?

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.115 align:middle line:84%
How do I identify if I'm
not working in this business

00:14:24.115 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
to sell this product?

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
How do I be myself if I'm
not devoted to this religion

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:90%
or this guru or this master?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Egregores dabble
in some kind of mysticism,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:90%
you had mentioned earlier.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.708 align:middle line:90%
How does that make it work?

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Well, it's a ritual.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.822 align:middle line:84%
We see the notion of egregores
becomes popular, as I said,

00:14:45.822 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
in the late 19th century with
the French and British occult

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:90%
revivals.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And while the term
gets sidelined

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
by the idea of collective
consciousness or group minds,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:90%
it's still there.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So there is a powerful
aspect of this

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that involves ritual
and ceremonial magic,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
because in those
operations, individuals

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
use chants and
slogans and increase

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:84%
their emotional
devotion, if you will,

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to the goal which the
ritual is to undertake.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And when that has
to do with worship

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
of deities or entities of
some kind, or even an ideal,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that emotional energy is
the food of the egregore.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the food of
the collective function

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of any group.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something magical to this?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.972 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, if you're an
occultist, you'll say, yes.

00:15:33.972 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you're not?

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: If you're
a psychologist,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll say it's
all psychological.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
take your choice there.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I am of the position
that there is definitely

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
a chain of beings involved
in these egregores,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
especially the larger ones, the
political and religious ones.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And it can be something like the
mystical body of Christ, which

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
people hear about; the
Communion of Saints;

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
the bodhisattvas
of Tibetan Buddhism

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or other Buddhist
sects; unknown masters.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
These are an example
of an egregore

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:90%
in religion and philosophy.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On Gaia's "Buzzsaw,"
Sean Stone talked about magic.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE: Don't you,
during the course of magic,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
encounter entities that
could be described as evil

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
or put you-- that create evil
or very chaotic, destructive

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:90%
conditions?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES WASSERMAN: You
encounter temptations.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people are working a lot
with the goetic or negative

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:90%
energies, you know?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
am not doing that.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But there is a flip side
to every positive energy.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have certainly
encountered that a lot.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed,
experienced, and dealt

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
with literal demonic possession.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
The most evil experience I ever
had was actually standing--

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
encountering someone in a hotel
bathroom, believe it or not,

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
who was a very, very,
very wealthy, wealthy guy

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
who owned the hotel.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
My uncle was-- worked for
him, and I went to the hotel

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
to visit my uncle.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:90%
And this guy had such a--

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I only met him for
like a second--

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:84%
had such a depth
of darkness in him

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that it still frightens
me to even think of it.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was a guy
dressed in a suit

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and smiled at me or
something in the way

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that people pass each other
in the bathroom, whatever.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
darkness, an emptiness

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
at his core, a kind of
grasping that Crowley describes

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
as the characteristic
of a black brother--

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
the most evil
force, he or she who

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
has rejected all love, all
sense of unity and purpose.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And this guy had that.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was weird.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a magical ceremony.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't in a temple
with candlelight.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It was in day to day life,
and I've never forgotten it.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he describing
a negative egregore?

00:18:10.303 --> 00:18:11.595 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Oh, most definitely.

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And James Wasserman, by the
way, wrote the introduction

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:90%
of my book.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was James--

00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That was
James Wasserman.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
What he described is real.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have very
good examples of that

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
in terms of positive
ones, and we

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.547 align:middle line:84%
have very good examples of
that in terms of negative ones,

00:18:25.547 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
which he discussed.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And, look, we need to
really look at the egregore

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
in terms of this has to
do with your relationship

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
to the invisible.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
we talk about what

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
is my reason for being
here on planet Earth.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And some people will take
that and grow with it.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Others will just go through and
have as much sensory experience

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
as they can.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Others will recognize that
they don't really view anything

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:90%
as existing in the invisible.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But whether you recognize
the invisible or not,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
it recognizes you.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And these egregores
have that potential to--

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:84%
as he said, this
was not in a ritual.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
This was a person
who had at some point

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:84%
given themselves over to evil
in whatever form that was.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would
everybody feel that

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.938 align:middle line:10%
and pick that up if
they ran into this guy?

00:19:15.938 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
someone like that.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.938 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
feel that there's

00:19:18.938 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
something wrong because we do
have an inherent Spidey sense.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We do have an inherent
protective mechanism,

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
an intuition, which lets us
know things aren't quite right.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:84%
However, how they might then
respond to that information

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
would have to do with
their willingness

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to accept that this
is a dangerous person

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.992 align:middle line:90%
and a dangerous experience.

00:19:37.992 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet the guy
apparently was successful.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
He was the owner of the hotel.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:90%
He seemed to do well.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
How could he create that kind
of negativity around himself?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Because he's
utterly self-absorbed.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with a variety of
people from murderers in denim

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:90%
to white collar criminals.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:84%
People don't really understand
that the universe and the world

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:90%
does not hold their values.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you get that
same feeling that Wasserman did

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:90%
with these kind of people--

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
a sense of negative darkness?

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Just as you can
sense a truly profound niceness,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
a graciousness, even a
saintliness on occasion

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
from someone, if you are
relaxed and are paying attention

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to your own inner self,
your own inner mind,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
you will also
notice those people

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
who are dangerous and
threatening to you as well.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet both
of them, both sides,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
can influence
individuals, can't they?

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
we as individuals

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
need to have a spiritual path
which helps us to understand

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
ourselves first and
foremost, so that we

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
can know when someone is
trying to influence us

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:90%
in a negative way.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Look, evil is a con game.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And as any con
man will tell you,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.632 align:middle line:90%
no one is innocent in a con.

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a little
larceny in your heart

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
for it to work.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'd be on both sides.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Right.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.135 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have a little
bit of goodness in you

00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:90%
to get pulled into the goodness.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to have
a little of selfishness

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:90%
to get pulled into it.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.595 align:middle line:84%
And as you stated early,
can it happen against us?

00:21:14.595 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, it can't happen
against our will,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:90%
but it happens in gradations.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
acclimated to it.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to get acclimated
to the environment of either

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
learning how to play Pro
Football from early on up

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to the pros, or you have to
get acclimated to being evil.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.498 align:middle line:84%
People don't start
out as murderers.

00:21:37.498 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And psychologists
will tell you that.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
born a murderer.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah,
you're probably not.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You may have an inclination
for it, a strong inclination,

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
for it like Heinrich Himmler or
Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But you have to move
in that direction

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and willingly engage
it at some point.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And it may start
out with just being

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
cruel to people to
actually hurting people

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.208 align:middle line:84%
and then whatever
happens along the way.

00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can an
egregore, though,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.153 align:middle line:84%
be so positive and
negative at the same time?

00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:05.695 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
it's not a egregore,

00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:90%
it's multiple egregores.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
We exist in a sea of
individuals and a sea of people.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And we exist in a sea of
collective thought forms.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Look, we live in an
attention economy.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And that means I
want your attention.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:10%
You want my attention.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:10%
And the whole focus of
the internet and media

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.518 align:middle line:10%
is to get your
attention, because if we

00:22:23.518 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:10%
get your attention,
we get your mind.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
If we get your mind,
we get your energy.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
We get what you call
your prana, your chi.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We get your noumatic experience,
as the classics would call it.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So if I have your attention,
and I have your energy,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I have the potential
to influence you.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What even got you
to write a book on egregores?

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you wake
up in the morning and say,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:90%
this is what I'm going to do.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, that's
the funny part about it.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I was in Binghamton, New
York at the Lost Dog Cafe

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
with Joscelyn Godwin, who
is a well-known expert

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and author on esotericism.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
sitting, yeah, geez,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to write a
monograph, just a small book

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
on egregores-- maybe
something limited.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think many
people would read it.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And he jokingly said,
well, thank god,

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.288 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't
do it, I'll have to.

00:23:11.288 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this was a topic
we had talked about.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went back home,
and I had notes.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it, and it
just flowed perfectly.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like any
other book I'd written.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it was done, it was
like Baby Bear's porridge.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
It was just right.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.863 align:middle line:90%
I wanted it to be bigger.

00:23:27.863 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:84%
There were things
I wanted to add.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But it just felt just as this
is perfect, right as it is.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.112 align:middle line:84%
We sent it off to
Inner Traditions, and--

00:23:35.112 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved it.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: They loved it.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved it.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And I thought,
well, this is nice.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:90%
And then, bam, it took off.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.037 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is
probably a bestseller.

00:23:45.037 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
name of that book?

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.037 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Oh,
that's "Egregores--

00:23:48.037 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The Occult Entities That
Watch Over Human Destiny."

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But it has just been an
endless series of interviews

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
on that book since it came out.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because it's the word.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is
we all have experiences

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have a name for.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that the
ancient gods had two names.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:90%
One was a secret name.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you knew the secret
name, you could control them.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fidelio.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, that's right.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And you see that in the popular
stories about exorcism, too.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The priest is always trying
to get the demon's name.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So I get the name,
I can control it.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I can look it up
in some registry

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and cast it back into
oblivion or something.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But when we have an
experience, and we

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have a name for it,
we're a little confused.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But people who read
the book say, I get it.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
was happening to me.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:90%
That was exactly my experience.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.743 align:middle line:84%
And when I could
put a name to it,

00:24:45.743 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I could free myself from it.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They said, oh,
that's what I was experiencing.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just me.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a process at work,
and that's the process.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had an opportunity
on "Beyond Belief"

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
to talk with Jonathan
Zap about thought forms,

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
much like what you've
been talking about.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Jonathan, what is a tulpa?

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JONATHAN ZAP:
Well, a tulpa is--

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it literally
means "mind-made entity"

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are
different versions in

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:90%
different mystical traditions.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Like in the Jewish tradition,
you talk about dybbuks.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's where you
set out to create an entity,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.237 align:middle line:84%
not to summon one
from the other--

00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:24.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
individual creates it.

00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Exactly, or sometimes
a group of individuals.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was a group
of British spiritualists,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:90%
very educated people.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.755 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to create
an entity, a human being

00:25:36.755 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:90%
with a whole history.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.797 align:middle line:84%
They made up the name,
almost like a fiction writer.

00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Create or conjure?

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Two different things, right?

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Not conjure, create.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.297 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So in other
words, completely out

00:25:45.297 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of their own
collective imagination.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:90%
They gave him a name.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:90%
They gave him a history.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But then they found that once
they had put enough energy

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
into him that he started
to have his own personality

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and preferences, as if he had an
independent or autonomous life.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
fiction writers, for example,

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fiction writer myself.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.728 align:middle line:84%
After a certain
point, characters

00:26:08.728 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
take on a life of
their own, and they

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:84%
do things that are inconvenient
to the plot of the story.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.537 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole movement
of people right now--

00:26:16.537 --> 00:26:18.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot about it
online-- where people

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
are creating these entities
and investing them with life

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and using them for different
purposes and that kind

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And after a certain point,
they seem to become autonomous.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.397 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now he sounds like
he's talking about egregores.

00:26:34.397 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: In a way.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.838 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In his own way.

00:26:36.838 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, in part-- and
I talk about that in the book.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:90%
What is a tulpa?

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.733 align:middle line:84%
And that term comes into the
popular conversation through

00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Alexandra David-Néel
and her book,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
"Magic and Mystery in Tibet,"
in which she talks about how she

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:90%
had mentally created this monk.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.347 align:middle line:84%
And this monk-- at first,
no one could see it.

00:26:53.347 --> 00:26:55.055 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
they could sense it,

00:26:55.055 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and then they could see it.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, well, then it
began to change and take

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:90%
on characteristics of its own.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it wouldn't go away.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
She had to dissolve it,
and it's a great effort.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And this raises a
lot of questions.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And you would ask, can
egregores influence us,

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:84%
or thought forms, an individual
thought form, influence us?

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And she recounts or
recalls a conversation

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
with a lama who said just
because we don't believe in

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
tigers doesn't mean
they aren't there,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to be careful
essentially of not only

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
the tigers of our own mind, but
the tigers of other people's

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:90%
minds as well.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a lot of
people focusing on something,

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
it gives it life and vitality
that can get away with itself.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
According to esoteric
tradition, it

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
can take on not only a life of
its own, but a form of its own.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you want to
influence the masses,

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:90%
how would you start that?

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:90%
How would you begin?

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You have
to have an ideal,

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
something which
more people than--

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
can wrap themselves around
like, a Utopian ideal--

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:90%
something big.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to have an
emotional appeal to it.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.603 align:middle line:84%
You have to make big
promises, because people

00:28:10.603 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
don't want small promises,
they want big ones.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to
deliver on those promises?

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.265 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: No.

00:28:15.265 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just promise them?

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Just promise.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Look, we can look
at advertising.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.697 align:middle line:84%
Advertising says if you
buy this truck for $50,000,

00:28:21.697 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:90%
your life is going to be better.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:90%
You'll look good.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: You'll look good.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll love you.

00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, I mean,
it doesn't mean it happens.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.508 align:middle line:84%
Religions have been
making promises

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years,
and they don't deliver.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.775 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how many
people make promises

00:28:34.775 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:90%
about the end of the world.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen yet.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It's, oh, I got the dates wrong.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you sound
like a politician.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
They make promises.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Do they deliver?

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, I think
that's why politics

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:90%
is such a big egregore.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And why it's so popular is they
get to lie through their teeth

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:90%
about stuff.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.147 align:middle line:90%
But you make big promises.

00:28:53.147 --> 00:28:54.730 align:middle line:84%
You get a people
involved emotionally.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You make them feel
good about themselves.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
You give them an
idea, and ideal.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:90%
You give them a logo.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
You give them a slogan to chant,
and you're off to the races.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the concept of
being an egregore manipulative?

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's
always restraining.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Whether it gets
manipulative or not

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is a matter of whether
it's beneficial to you.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you can
join a group, and it

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:90%
can be very beneficial to you.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The right group.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yeah, you join
Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.647 align:middle line:84%
Weight Watchers, your local
Rotary or Kiwanis Club.

00:29:27.647 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That puts limits on you
while you're in the group,

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and it limits your
time, because you only

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:84%
have so much time, talent,
and treasure to go around.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can grow
tremendously from that group.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You can grow tremendously from
some religious and spiritual

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you get
into the wrong kind of cult?

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's the problem.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It happens slowly.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know because
your identity is totally

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
consumed by it.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't have an
identity outside of it.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:90%
That's how you know.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're so hard
to get rid of and get out of.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know an individual,
Mark, who was in a cult

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:90%
a long, long time ago.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:90%
He got out of it.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But I can still tell
just talking to him

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that there is some kind of an
effect on this guy's psyche

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't gone away.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost frightening.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Nice guy-- he's
probably an empath.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But whatever happened in this
cult has convinced this guy

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to believe any kind of
conspiracy he hears.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:90%
That's his downfall-- anything.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not going
to cite an example,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:84%
but whatever
conspiracy, far-fetched

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
as it may seem, he believes it
and grasps it and won't let go.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think when he
was in this cult,

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
they created this
in this poor guy.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.435 align:middle line:90%
And he can't get rid of it.

00:30:55.435 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You know, and I
hear that story so many times.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And conspiracies are a
very good example because--

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some are true.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.837 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, of
course they're true.

00:31:05.837 --> 00:31:07.935 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have history
to show it's true.

00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We're filming this on May 8, I
think, and-- whatever, May 7,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the day the German
Armed Forces officially

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
surrendered to the Allied
Powers in World War II.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet again, we see that
that was a conspiracy.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
National Socialism
was a conspiracy.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:84%
People agreed to sit around a
table at the Wannsee Conference

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.803 align:middle line:84%
and murder tens of
millions of people.

00:31:37.803 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And they knew they were
doing something wrong,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
so they redacted the minutes
so that instead of saying,

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.030 align:middle line:84%
we're transporting
them to gas chambers,

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
we're relocating them.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:90%
So conspiracies happen.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could they
live with themselves?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's the question.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you've thrown
yourself that deeply

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
into-- and I don't use this
term loosely, but "evil"--

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
that's how.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
manage these egregores?

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.775 align:middle line:90%
Can you control them?

00:32:01.775 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: You can't.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You cannot?

00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The people
at the top control them

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:90%
or think they control them.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to
do is just recognize,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is my being involved in this
group healthy to me or not?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And when it's not, you have
to learn how to get out of it.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:90%
But you can't really control it.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the people at the
top that control them

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's-- because
they're hierarchical.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the people at the
top, if we go by the ancients,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:84%
they report to the
invisibles at the top.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.358 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:31.358 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: So that's the point.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Just as a corporation
has its president,

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and the president is accountable
to the board of directors,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the board of directors
is that invisible being

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:90%
or beings at the top.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So if they're saints
and bodhisattvas,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:90%
you're in good hands.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:90%
You're in good hands.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They will look out for
your best interest.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, you're
in trouble, like what

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
James talked about there
with demonology and goetia.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, the darkness.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Darkness.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I think in terms
of conspiracy, we

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
need to talk about
something here,

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and that is egregores
don't necessarily

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.360 align:middle line:84%
have to have a central
function that we can recognize.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's where conspiracy
theories come in.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:84%
People connect the
dots when there may not

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:90%
be a direct connection.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And they need to
make sense of things.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So most people who are obsessed
with conspiracy theories, who

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
are always connecting
things, are

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
essentially materialists when
you get right down to it.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're easily led.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
they're easily led.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.662 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 1980s at
Stanford Research Institute,

00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:84%
there was a tremendous amount
of psychic research going on.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And you know many people--

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, sure.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But a lot of that
research also went into UFOs,

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and it went into
computer science.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's from Jacques
Vallée that I grabbed the term

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:84%
"social control mechanism,"
because it fits what

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.710 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
other work at Stanford,

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and that had to do with
more psychological work.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And they published
a book called,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
"The Changing Images of Man."

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little difficult read
and a little boring in parts,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
but when you get
to the end of it,

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about what
we're talking about here.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And they say that when
you have common values--

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:90%
common ideals, we could say--

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
you don't need people to
be communicating together.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Those common values will
set the framework wherein

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
which they will act
pretty much the same way

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in the same situation
as other people

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:84%
who have those values,
even if there's

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:90%
no communication between them.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So to have that
conspiracy, if you will,

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
you don't need someone
getting the email, the memo,

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:90%
or the telegram.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:84%
What you have to
do is have shared

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
value structures between them.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And they can be disconnected
between time and space.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, people
who have shared values

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:90%
can move between mechanisms.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:90%
They called them "hubs."

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.890 align:middle line:84%
We could call them egregores--
because the value structure

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:90%
share.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about social
egregores and mental control

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
on the masses,
it's about what are

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
the common values that are being
discussed, for good or ill.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.478 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
control people.

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily need to
because they control themselves

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I haven't heard too
much good about this, though.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
that's the problem.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you?

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Only within a handful
of esoteric and spiritual

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
movements, because we live
in the world of duality,

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and let's face it, there's a
lot of difficulty in the world,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of suffering,
a lot of ignorance.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So naturally anything
that has to do with power

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is unfortunately probably going
to tend towards more suffering

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:90%
than good.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
we've talked a lot

00:35:52.865 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:90%
of darkness about egregores.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Deborah King talked
about getting rid

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:90%
of negative entities.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.798 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what she recommends.

00:36:00.798 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBORAH KING: And I
was asleep one night.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
middle of the night.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew up
there in the corner

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:84%
of the room there
was a dark force.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And it taunted me.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It shook the bed.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And it hollered at me all night.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.005 align:middle line:90%
It was just terrifying.

00:36:16.005 --> 00:36:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this went on
for several nights.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:90%
How did you sleep?

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I didn't,
and I was exhausted.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, they wear you
down and wear you down.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
And so finally, I got smart.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I called a friend,
and I asked them

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to go to the nearest
church and pick up

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:90%
a crucifix and some holy water.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And that next
night, I was ready.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You pulled these out?

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did, and I just aimed.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can use whatever
icon works for you, whatever

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.010 align:middle line:90%
your belief system might be.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And it pulled it back.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's never been
that severe since.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could holy
water and a crucifix work?

00:36:53.872 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it depends
on who you ask as to why.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, for her,
it's because it brought up

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the most positive thing she
could conjure within herself.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.565 align:middle line:84%
And she had faith
and trust in it.

00:37:04.565 --> 00:37:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For herself.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: For herself.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And that emotional value of
confidence and faith and trust

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and what it meant,
not just for her,

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
but the whole idea of,
of course, the church,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and the whole body and energy
of the church behind that--

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that's what gives her
strength, because she

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.510 align:middle line:84%
was able to get beyond
herself in a positive way.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.490 align:middle line:84%
She identified with the power
of, in this case, Christianity

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy and positive way
and was able to direct that.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you
walked into a party,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:10%
could you tell if
there was a group

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.273 align:middle line:10%
of egregores doing their thing?

00:37:36.273 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
you can, but just

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:84%
as you can walk into
any group or large room

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:84%
with gathering of people
and notice the cliques

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and how those cliques
form around certain ways.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So think of it in
those ways, too.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.090 align:middle line:90%
You can notice it.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:90%
That's not rocket science.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But if we're looking
at spiritual entities

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that affect them, that you
require a certain degree

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.857 align:middle line:90%
of sensitivity to.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I've known people who are
very good at sensing it,

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:90%
but they can't articulate it.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%

described, an empath.

Or they feel happy,
and they want to stay,

00:38:12.487 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:90%

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And we look at situations.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
We see people come from
terrible backgrounds

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and use those experiences
and the discipline

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.880 align:middle line:84%
to make themselves better
people and inspirations and role

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:90%
models for us.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's possible.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of a
negative entity,

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we do see ideas
of that occurring

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
in religious movements.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most famous
example is in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.900 align:middle line:84%
where Guru Padmasambhava is
said to have gone into Tibet

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and pacified all the
evil spirits and demons

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and brought them into
alignment with the Buddhist

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.680 align:middle line:84%
dharma, the teachings
of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So we see these evil forces
being turned into something--

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:84%
according to the
story, being turned

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:90%
into a service of Buddhism.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.995 align:middle line:84%
We see the same in the
various mythologies--

00:39:45.995 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: No, it's not.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was an exceptionally
practiced tantric or magician

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:90%
We see the same with Solomon.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon,
according to folklore,

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:84%
was not just the king of Israel,
but he was a accomplished

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.770 align:middle line:84%
magician-- hence, the
poetic texts with--

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Jim was referring to often have
the name of "Solomon" attached

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to them, even though
he didn't write them.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that the
entire Temple of Solomon

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
was built by 50,000
demons which were bound

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:17.640 align:middle line:84%
into service of the king to
produce the temple dedicated

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:90%
to God.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So to review,
egregores can be a grouping

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:90%
of positive or negative.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It could be either one.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Correct.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's
kind of neutral ones.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we go through life
with some which are not really

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that powerful, so we
don't notice them--

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
just relationships
that come and go.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.735 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But the ones
we're concerned with,

00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that we want the viewer
to really recognize,

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is those things which are
helpful to them and to know it

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.633 align:middle line:90%
and those which--

00:40:45.633 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:84%
they're not so good for you,
and you need to separate out.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
know the difference?

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.437 align:middle line:84%
What's good for
them, what's not?

00:40:52.437 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's
the problem in life.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We go through life stumbling
and trying to find out.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why a personal
review is so important.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It's good to just sit
back every once in a while

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.813 align:middle line:90%
and do a personal inventory.

00:41:03.813 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of ourselves?

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.563 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Of ourselves,
and then from that,

00:41:06.563 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:90%
our relationships.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.798 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that realistic?

00:41:08.798 --> 00:41:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, we
all have to do it

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:90%
if we want to progress in life.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:90%
We have to look.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Have my thoughts, have my
words, and have my actions

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:84%
brought about the
desired results?

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And have those results--

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:84%
if they have, they
been beneficial to me

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.110 align:middle line:84%
in better understanding
my life, having a better

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.270 align:middle line:84%
relationship with my
friends and family,

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.990 align:middle line:84%
having a more successful
life and a healthier one,

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:84%
or more importantly, even, in
my understanding of my place

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, in
my divine nature?

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is, in
your opinion, Mark,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:84%
the best way for someone
to change their life

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and become positive?

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, just
step away from everything

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.470 align:middle line:90%
for a little while.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Separate out to let the
noise in your head calm down.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And then do a personal inventory
and look about your goals

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:90%
and aspirations.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:84%
What are the things you
want to accomplish in life?

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.210 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to accomplish them?

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And go about doing it.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And find a good mentor.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.205 align:middle line:90%
Find a good person--

00:42:10.205 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That seems
to be the key here.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.413 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It's the
key to everything.

00:42:13.413 --> 00:42:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the key to it all.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.900 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, if you're
having trouble with addiction,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and you need to be free of drugs
or alcohol or other addictions,

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:25.580 align:middle line:84%
there's many groups
you can join.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Join them.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Find that mentor.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:84%
That mentor doesn't
have to be perfect.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
All he or she has to
do is help you get free

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:84%
or learn to free yourself from
those things which you're in

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:90%
bondage to.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's what a guru does.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:84%
A guru doesn't really
have to be perfect.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They just have to help you
learn how to free yourself

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
from those things which keep
you in bondage and in ignorance

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get your books, Mark?

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.080 align:middle line:90%
How do they find what you do?

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: They can easily
find them at Amazon.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:10%
They can Google it, and they'll
see a host of publications.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:10%
They can contact me
directly at the Institute

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.070 align:middle line:10%
for Hermetic Studies.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And they can email
me off that site.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And if they write to me,
I'll do my best to reply.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you came
across a group of egregores

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:84%
who were positive, what
would you tell them?

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.052 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I direct
people to them.

00:43:20.052 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:10%
If they have an interest, and
they ask the right questions,

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.552 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, these are
some groups of people that

00:43:24.552 --> 00:43:26.243 align:middle line:10%
are doing wonderful things.

>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:43:34.215 --> 00:43:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And if it's not, run.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Run, yeah.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Get away.

They could be negative.
