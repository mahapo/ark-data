00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Is humankind on the verge of
open extraterrestrial contact?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And, if so, is the current
disclosure movement

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
a first step towards
revealing a collective

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
of non-terrestrial
intelligences working together

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
within a Galactic Federation.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
For more than 60 years,
alternative media

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
has explored the idea
of a Galactic Federation

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
from popular sci-fi
shows to individuals

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
who claim to be in communication
with the extraterrestrial

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:90%
intelligences.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of a Galactic
Federation as reality

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
has been made more significant
with its acknowledgment

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
by the former general and head
of Israel's defense ministry's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
space directorate, Haim
Eshed, when he publicly

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
proclaimed earthlings
have been in contact

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
from a Galactic Federation.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:10%
>> In December 2020, Haim
Eshed, who is a retired Israeli

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.188 align:middle line:10%
security chief talked to the
Jerusalem post and said, oh,

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:10%
there is a Galactic Federation
and they've been involved with

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.813 align:middle line:10%
human affairs but they're
staying hidden right now

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:10%
because we're not
ready for them.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And they want us to know--
they're here to observe us

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're very interested
in the fabric of the universe

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and we need to know more about
the fabric of the universe.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's pretty
extraordinary.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Former Canadian minister of
National Defense and longtime

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:10%
member of parliament, the
late honorable Paul Hellyer,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:10%
was the first and only cabinet
ranking official from a G8

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:10%
nation to publicly state his
belief in extraterrestrials

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:10%
and the alleged Galactic
Federation of aliens.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I only know about
the Galactic Federation,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:10%
but they are concerned about
what's going on in the world.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And they have been working
through individuals.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:90%
They say, you clean up your act.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:90%
You're in charge.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It's your planet.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:10%
And if it comes
to a dead end, it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:10%
will because you let it
or made it a dead end.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Even in my conversations I
had with the late Paul Hellyer,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:10%
he told me that we had
extraterrestrials helping

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:10%
our scientists on Earth at bases
and there was full cooperation

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:10%
with them.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Paul would say that these were
part of a Galactic Federation.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, a tactical advisor
to covert analysts in Germany

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand the
missions and strategies

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of non-terrestrial intelligences
on Earth recalls information

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
from a collective of beings in
the six density that Tim refers

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:90%
to as being six.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I also have heard being six
talk about some of its members

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
being part of a
Galactic Federation.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be
a lot of truth to it.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things in
a dualistic universe that

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
comes up within species
is allianceship,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
which means finding
people who support

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
your own position,
which I would say

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is a truth all over the
place in the universe.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
You have many alliances.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are setting up their
own allianceship, so to speak.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But different other
species as well

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%
have contracts with each other.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And being six directly spoke
about a Galactic Federation,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
yes, which basically
makes sense because you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
have so many cultures and
so many different planets

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and so many different
standpoints going on

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that
it totally makes

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
sense to have some kind
of regulatory system

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:90%
that might balance that out.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way I understand
a Galactic Federation.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be quite a
complicated situation

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
because you have so many
different agendas going on.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> While no one can say with
certainty when the Galactic

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Federation was first created,
some experts suggest it may

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
have been as much as hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:10%
>> My understanding is that
this is the time where there has

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:10%
been a sort of competition, some
sort of conflict that started

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:10%
to happen within this galaxy.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Most researchers agree that
the Galactic Federation started

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
as a defense treaty
from reptilian expansion

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:90%
into our galaxy.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, it was decided
or decreed, if you will,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that a kind of a neutral
organization be put in place

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to supervise and
maintain the order within this

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to
remember, this galaxy

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
is part of a larger
conglomerate of galaxies

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:90%
and then the universe.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are larger
organizations

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that are also in charge
of maintaining order

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:90%
across the universe.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when one particular
area is struggling

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
with any sort of
conflict or issues

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
between species, then that
larger organization is going

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to say, we need some
local organization

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that will supervise this
area of the universe

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and make sure it maintains
the order that is necessary.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Through his role as a
tactical advisor in the German

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:10%
equivalent of unacknowledged
special access programs,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:10%
Tim has had more than 100
face-to-face encounters with

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrial species
referred to as the Greys,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:10%
which he describes as having
an artificially created body

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:10%
into which they download their
individual consciousness.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Tim believes they're
a benevolent race who

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
have an influence on
the Galactic Federation.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I understand it
is that there's not only one

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
singular Galactic Federation and
it definitely has not influence

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
over every single
part of the universe.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a
construct which seems

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to be set up for more and
more species and planets,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
but there are also like
different federations

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and different interest groups
and very strong boundaries

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
or loose boundaries all over
the place in the universe.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So I have in-depth knowledge
about the federation

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys are in, where
human military personnel is

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
also engaged and different
other warrior type species.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I personally think that
this is different than what

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
pop culture and media portrays
as Galactic Federation or even

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that Galactic Federation that
Israel was speaking about.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I think they have
different mindsets,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
but I mean there still
seems to be some overlapping

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:90%
influences here and there.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> While one might assume
that there are ongoing contact

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
scenarios between federation
members and various

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
governmental, military, and
interest groups on Earth,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
countless individuals worldwide
also claim contact with

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Galactic Federation members.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the 1950s, we have
seen just a sort of a parade,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
if you will, of people that
maintain that they have had

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
encounters with representatives
of the Galactic Federation that

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
they themselves are agents of
the federation and that they

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
are now bringing
forward this message.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So what is the role of the
individual in this scenario?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is to say,
well, if you are receiving

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that information to make
sure you are the best

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
representative of
that information

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just saying
things that are coming off

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.310 align:middle line:84%
the top of your head, that there
is some kind of backup for what

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:90%
you're saying.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to put
yourself on an out like that,

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to
be put on a stand

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and tell the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be sure
that what the individuals are

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
bringing forward does have some
connection to reality let's

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And that to me,
is sort of tricky

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
because individuals
don't carry the clout

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:90%
that a government does.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And, so it's a sort of a
David versus Goliath scenario.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you put together
multiple individuals,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.595 align:middle line:84%
multiple eyewitnesses that
have all seen the same thing

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and they are carrying
essentially the same message,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
now that's a whole
different story

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
happening today.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Matias De Stefano expands
on the idea of the Galactic

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Federation as a group of species
who share the same ideals

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to include entire planets
as one consciousness.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:90%
He calls this the Confederation.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The word Confederation
actually comes from the Latin

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:10%
and means those who share a
faith together that they trust

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:10%
to one another.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So a Confederation
is basically a group

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of planets that
trust each other,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and their agenda is basically
to help those planets that

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
are willing or in process of
evolution towards consciousness

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to find their own way of
acknowledging themselves.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So what they started to do was
to work with these planets that

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
were in the path of
evolution so they

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:90%
could share much more data.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they are having
this agenda of helping humans

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
because they love humans or
because we are the good ones

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it's
just because they

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
see that our planet,
like many others,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
has the potential of
sharing a lot of data,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot of information.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you think
about the Galactic Federation,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
you have to try to think about
it like if you are talking

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
about your own brain trying
to figure out something

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and connecting neurons, data and
improving the way in which you

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
understand the
reality around you.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> According to researchers,
the Galactic Federation is

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
comprised of countless
species and civilizations.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The ones most
familiar to humanity

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
are the Andromedans, Arcturians,
Sirians, Pleiadians, and

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Felines.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
While other councils,
alliances, and associations

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:84%
exist to work together
on various projects

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and agendas which may also
include Galactic Federation

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The core members of the
peaceful inner circle

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:90%
include these five.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The Galactic Federation
includes tens of thousands

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:10%
of different categories.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
In my work, the Arcturians
would be one category

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
as being the midway intelligence
between the planetary systems

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
of the third dimension and
those of the higher dimensions.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Another would be
the Andromedans,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
they would be those who
create amazing spacecraft that

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
would require them to do
the building in outer space

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're dealing
with molecular relationships

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
on multiple levels going through
electromagnetic spectrums.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Another, of course, would
be the Pleiadians that

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
come from what we would call
in the Indigenous tradition,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:84%
the Seven Sisters, or
the planetary association

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of emphasizing the artistic and
the holistic realm of creation.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The Galactic Federation is
made up of all those beings

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:10%
trying to help
humanity right now.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:10%
They're not designed
just for us,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:10%
but that's the ones
that are focusing

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:10%
right now on our development.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Arcturians are
a key part to that.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:10%
There's other races as well
that are part of that--

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:10%
those connected with Sirius,
for example, the star system

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:10%
Sirius, those connected
with the Pleiadians,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:10%
these are all intelligences
that are here now influencing

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.365 align:middle line:10%
our technology, our
consciousness so we can grow.

00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Another major player in
the Galactic Federation is

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadians.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians also play a very
important role in the galaxy.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades have a
very, very large mixture

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:90%
of species right there.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the Pleiadians
are the most knowledgeable

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:90%
about the galaxy.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many members
of this Confederation,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
but each one of them has a very
different way to relate to each

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
of the main members

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:84%
are the Pleiadians that
were basically the ones that

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:90%
moved everyone to create it.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Pleiadians saying,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
we need to download
this information.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians
saying, OK, we know

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
how to make a package
for this information.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirians
saying, OK, we know

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
how to build a reality
around that package

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:90%
so it could be improved.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
are the main ones

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that designed this idea
of putting together

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
many of those concepts
and information that

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:84%
came from other worlds
and other solar systems.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:10%
>> In an unexpected spontaneous
download from extraterrestrial

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:10%
intelligences with whom
Marina Jacobi is in contact,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:10%
she shares information
regarding the prominent species

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:10%
of the Galactic Federation.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>> When you see a
Galactic Federation,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:10%
understand that in the
evolutionary moment every

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:10%
single perspective of
reality has a representative.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Each family, so-called
Galactic family,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
realizes that you cannot be
disengaged with consciousness

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And in order to continue
your evolutionary process

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
of expansion, you must go in
the next level of understanding.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Once you connect to
that frequency so

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
you shall see that
reality for yourself.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If humanity has the chance to
utilize their biological bodies

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and to utilize their dualistic
way of perceiving reality,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:90%
then they can grow from that.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So what they did and they--
meaning higher frequencial

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
beings being six if you want to
name it, they had an embargo,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
a frequencial embargo
surrounding Earth,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning this planet this
planetary life sphere that we

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
are on right now is only
capable of displaying life forms

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and data that comes
from level 1, 2, 3,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and 4 consciousness
but is not able to--

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
capable of receiving
direct influence

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
from levels 5, 6, and 7.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
chance, the opportunity

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that life on this planet needed
in order to grow individually.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:10%
That being said,
the Earth is now

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:10%
heading towards a
situation in the universe

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:10%
where higher frequencies are
loud and directly influencing

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:10%
this planet and its
vibrational field,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:10%
which makes it
possible for having

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:10%
direct influences by higher
frequencials in the upcoming

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:10%
time.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The Galactic Federation has
been in contact with humanity

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:10%
longer than anyone truly knows.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Consensus amongst
experts suggest

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
that their agenda is to aid
in our conscious evolution.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But will humanity ever become
aware of our Galactic family

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
through some kind of
public disclosure?

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible that hints
of a Galactic Federation

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
have already made their way
into mainstream media via TV

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and film?

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that intelligence
agencies like to use movies

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and television to disseminate
certain truths and ideas that

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:90%
might be unknown to the public.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that they
use shows like "Star Trek"

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
to convey the concept of
a Galactic Federation?

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1970s through
colleagues of mine working with

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Andrija Puharich in New York,
we had the opportunity to have

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:10%
Gene Roddenberry, the
famous Gene Roddenberry,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:10%
part of one of our study groups
and he heard the terminology

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:10%
used frequently by one of my
colleagues Phyllis Schlemmer.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:10%
And at that time,
he was so intrigued

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:10%
by the paraphysical phenomena
that happened in the rooms

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:10%
that we were being used for
telepathic communication,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:10%
that he went on, I am told,
to expand this later in life

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:10%
into what is called "Deep
Space Nine" utilizing

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:10%
the terminology of the nine
or the higher cosmic entities

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:10%
behind shall we say the thoughts
and the efforts of the Galactic

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:10%
Federation to guide humanity
into a higher level.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>> And it is through Phyllis
that we gain some of these

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:10%
little tidbits and these little
elements that Gene Roddenberry

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:10%
was able to incorporate
into "Star Trek"

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:10%
into "Deep Space Nine" to help
prime the human mind to this

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:10%
evolutionary concept to this
growth that we are not alone

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:10%
in this galaxy, that there is
this greater council watching

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:10%
over us and protecting us, but
they can't interfere with us

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:10%
until we are ready
to be joining them,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:10%
until we're ready to have
our evolutionary shift

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:10%
and technology to grow into this
higher state of being and join

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:10%
the Galactic
Federation at large.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:10%
Now what may be that the reason
why we see this logo popping up

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:10%
in all of the
world's space agency

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:10%
is that it is a salute to this
original Andromedan Council

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:10%
in the Galactic
Federation that we learned

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:10%
about from the Council of 9
through the medium Phyllis

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Schlemmer in these
various meetings

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:10%
with Gene Roddenberry
and other folks.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind of made
its way and dispersed itself

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world so
that we can be aware of it.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Since space agencies logos
worldwide integrate the A

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
shaped symbol one
might question,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
why our current cylindrical
rocket shaped technology

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:90%
isn't depicted instead?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:10%
>> If we look at the logos
of many different space

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:10%
organizations on Earth, we
notice that there's this A

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:10%
shape to it.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting to find out
that this A shape may actually

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:10%
refer back to this
Andromedan Council.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just a hint to all of us
that the Andromedan Council

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
still has a place and a
role in the development

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
of human technologies
and human civilizations

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
as we're growing
into the new age.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:10%
>> What's really interesting
is that the shape of this

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:10%
particular logo regardless
of the language that these

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:10%
countries represent because a
lot of language have different

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.103 align:middle line:10%
characters, for instance, the
Chinese characters don't look

00:19:43.103 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:10%
anything like the Russian
characters that don't look

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:10%
anything like English, but
they all use the same A symbol.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
with this is that, I

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
think this is a direct
correlation of this A

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
symbol coming from a higher
extraterrestrial language.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of people
don't realize this,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:10%
but language here on Earth
didn't originate here on Earth.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Language here on
Earth originated

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
beings that

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth maybe hundreds
of thousands of years

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
ago to teach Earth
people civilization

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
and that includes the language.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>> More than seeing the A shaped
symbol here on official Space

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:10%
Agency logos,
researchers suggest that

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:10%
there's a potential
connection between these logos

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:10%
and our closest
neighboring constellations.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Might there be significance
to the specific star

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
clusters appearing on
government's insignias?

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It's interesting when we look
at some of the space agencies

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:10%
version of the symbol.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It differs slightly from the
"Star Trek" logo in that there

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
are many different
stars depicted

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and having these constellations
on this symbol for space travel

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and space agencies can't
be just a coincidence.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the space force logo,

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
they're essentially telling
us with the symbology that

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
they're getting help that
they have outside influences.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you might say that
this similarity in these logos

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
are telling you that at the
highest levels of government,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
they're working in
unison together.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at these logos
for the space agencies and we

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
see the three stars that
are on them are contactees,

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
gives us a different perspective
of what those three stars could

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:90%
mean.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They suggest that those three
stars are for Andromeda,

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Arcturus, and Lyra,
which are three

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:84%
of the big players of
the Galactic Federation

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that have a big part in the role
of humanity and our evolution

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and protecting us
here on our planet.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I think because the Galactic
Federation who is representing

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:90%
the Andromeda Council--

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of like an arm
of the Andromeda Council.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They've been in contact
with certain Earth agencies,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Earth agencies have had
access to this logo,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and so they adopted it as their
own logo, maybe in the hopes

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that one day they'll be a member
of the Galactic Federation.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But instead, there's
definitely a connection there.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Regarding why an A like for
Andromeda or that connection

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:10%
would be in many agencies--

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:10%
the information brings me
to a much more human concept

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:10%
regarding Andromeda.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:10%
Basically, Andromeda "andros,"
it's basically the divine

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.120 align:middle line:10%
being that protected men.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the skies,
you see this soft light

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
when it's very clear, which
is Andromeda far away.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a spirit flying
in between the stars protecting

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:90%
our realities.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
If anyone is trying to protect
the skies from something that

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is coming, they would use a
symbol of Andromeda to say,

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones
taking care of men.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> As humankind moves closer to
understanding our place within

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the greater galactic community,
our own readiness on both

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
an individual and collective
level may be the determining

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:90%
factor for success.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> As the open contact
scenario unfolds,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that there's
two paths that it could

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:90%
potentially take.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:10%
One is the path of
humanity joining

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:10%
what I refer to as the dragon
where we merge with technology

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:10%
and we all become a single hive
mind that's something talked

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:10%
about by the US government--
promoted by the US government,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:10%
that you lose your
individuality that there

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:10%
is one human being on this
planet, one race that is it,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:10%
subservient to the dragon
and the technology.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The other path is
where we retain

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
our organic and
spiritual selves,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and we plug into a
spiritual hierarchy--

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
spiritually motivated Galactic
Federation that assists us

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in becoming more like
an angelic species

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
maintaining our biology,
but at the same time,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
merging more with higher
frequencies of light,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%
rather than technology.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they coexist.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I think they could possibly
intersect slightly,

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:90%
but I don't think they coexist.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an
either/or situation,

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and we are right now
in the next five years

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
deciding which that
is going to be.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And there they will find
the federation waiting.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not only the Galactic
Federation that's coming here,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
it's also those who are doing
their own thing checking us

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
out, doing their own medical
experiments on our biology.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's complex.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They're different intelligences,
but thank goodness,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
there is a greater galactic
hall who's also watching us,

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
part of the Galactic
Federation who's here to help,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're all part of that
greater wholism in terms

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness ability to
understand our own development.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of us are still
believing we're alone

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to
take some time.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, to
unfold very gradually,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I would say even from
now moving forward.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We are now close in a whole
history from the first time

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that we got in contact
with the Confederation.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So it means that we have
gone through a whole process

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
of inner process and now
we are ready to go out.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time that people

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
are willing to go to
the moon, to Mars.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the planet is kind
of ready to go beyond.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say humans
is the planet, that

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
is the planet-- the awareness
of the planet that is saying,

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I am bigger than this.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's why humans are
trying to leave the planet, not

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because we don't like
it, but because it's

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:90%
the moment to spread.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This means that
the whole planet is

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to open
themselves to other realities

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to something bigger.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But, I wouldn't say that
would happen in our lifetime.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a lot of
things to do before we

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
can get in touch with them.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
We have problems with our
neighbors and our families.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:90%
We cannot deal with others.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Everyone, everywhere that
makes a willingful decision

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:10%
to be part of a Galactic
Federation in a harmonious

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:10%
and peace-making and balancing
way contributes something

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:10%
to this community-- everyone.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Basically, everyone watching
this can grow and be together.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Just the single thought
contributes something

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to this Galactic
Federation in the way

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that higher frequencials
understand it.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can contact the
species or any other species

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and ask for help, or even ask
for a positive outcome, which

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:84%
is basically the all shift
happening now concept

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that we were doing.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The Galactic Federation
exists because the nature

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of life is one of
cooperative help.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
The ability of brotherly
and sisterly love.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And so our understanding
of the Galactic Federation

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
will be like looking at
brothers and sisters who

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
are cosmic cousins on the other
side of the pond of space.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And brothers and sisters who
have learned to achieve results

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:10%
by going through the quagmire
that we find ourselves

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:10%
in what part of humanity wants
new science and part of it

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:10%
wants old spirituality.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, science and
spirituality do merge together

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
requires a upgrade
of our consciousness.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the Galactic
Federation is here

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to provide the ways and
means for the upgrade

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
that we can be--

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
should we see using more
of that great talent that

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:84%
is in our brain to be using
more of that powerful spirit

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
vibration of our heart.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately to
having the vision

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're all one
species growing up

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
as Homo universalis, which
means universal humanity

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
in the fullest sense of
exploring the universe

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.505 align:middle line:84%
and being citizens in
this greater universe.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> As citizens of
this greater universe,

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:10%
we may not see an official
disclosure regarding

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:10%
the Galactic Federation from
our governments just yet.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Still, evidence suggests
that a Galactic Federation

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and the various species within
it have been influencing

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and continue to influence
individuals and a greater

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:90%
humanity on Earth to this day.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
As we look to our galactic
family amongst the stars,

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
there are many people
who find comfort knowing

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:90%
that they are looking back.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Next time on deep
space, we explore

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the most controversial
species in history--

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
the Greys.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:90%
