00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Recently, new research has
revealed that the Germans may

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:10%
have been researching
flying craft and, possibly,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravity for over 150 years.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>> I was aware of the 1890s
airship mystery as a result

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
of being interested in
UFOs since I was a kid.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And when you follow through on
looking at the 1890s airship

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.658 align:middle line:10%
mystery, you're going to come
across the Sonora Aero Club.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>> This is one of these things
that's really never adequately

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:10%
been explained to this day.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:10%
So starting in Sacramento,
California, in 1896,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:10%
going through various
parts of the American

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:10%
West to as far as
Chicago, and, I think,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:10%
St Louis and some of
the Midwest there.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The evidence that we have
for the 1890s airship mystery

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and these airship sightings
actually happening are

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
the numerous newspaper reports
all over the Western United

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:10%
The dozens, in some cases
the hundreds, in other cases,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:10%
of people in major cities and
other various populated areas

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:10%
seeing these airships,
not only seeing these

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:10%
airships flying overhead,
but the airships would land.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:10%
And the crew and the pilots
would step off these things

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
and tell the people
about the airships.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
They'd bring them on board
and they'd show them.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Airship technology in
1897, this is something a lot

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
of people don't realize,
was so primitive.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:10%
So airships, first
of all, hardly

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:10%
existed in the
United States at all.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:10%
They were most advanced
in France and in Europe.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And even there, they couldn't
go more than five or 10 miles.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were
impossible to navigate.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:90%
They were dangerous as hell.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
People regularly got
killed trying to fly them.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So to have an
airship that's even

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
being described as going
30-50 miles per hour,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that's really an impossibility
as far as the technology.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
To steer it and to have
it go the distances

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that this airship would have
gone, I think, is impossible.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Some of them would land.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They'd interact
with the occupants.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
This is before
Zeppelins and dirigible.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:10%
So they really didn't
know what they were.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's the newspaper reports
that must be looked at more

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:10%
closely and taken
more seriously,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:10%
because there's so many of them.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And they give so
much more information

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
than people usually get.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:10%
We learn about the
Sonora Aero Club

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:10%
and we first hear of
this mysterious NYMZA

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:10%
from a man named Charles
A A Delschau, who

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:10%
was a German immigrant born
in Brandenburg, Prussia

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:10%
in, I think, 1830.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And he comes to America
as a young man via Texas

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and continues on
out to California

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
at the behest of this
mysterious NYMZA group.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
He then, after being there
for three or four years

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and then being involved with the
activities of this Flying Club,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
he then returns to Texas where
he spends the rest of his life.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And finally, in the 1890s, he
took his diary and he created--

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
he was a very good artist--

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and he created several hundreds
of paintings of these aeros.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
albums of them.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And he left them
behind when he died.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And they were almost destroyed.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
They were found in a trash
heap in an antique store.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:10%
According to Delschau, NYMZA was
a secretive German-based group

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:10%
that was financing and
providing resources

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:10%
to these various small
groups of inventors

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:10%
building flying machines.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was all done
very secretively.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sonora Aero Club
functioned under NYMZA

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.033 align:middle line:84%
for a period of time
and then broke away.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a bunch of
people that are developing

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
high technology in secret.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> These aeros, as they
called their flying machines,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been powered
by a very rudimentary,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
proof of concept version
of anti-gravity technology.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In that time, in that
space, you see the development.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You kind of see a
technical development.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You see the beginnings of some
sort of a secret group that's

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
developing high technology.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm convinced that the
1890s airships were definitely

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:10%
the same technology the
1850s further developed.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that idea that we have
secret societies creating high

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
technology and are very
mysterious about where

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
their high technology
is coming from.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:10%
>> But are there other
researchers who were interested

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:10%
in the same ideas that the
Germans were researching?

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:10%
Was anyone else interested
in anti-gravity?

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:10%
We discovered two men
in the United States

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:10%
who were interested in the
connection between gravity

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:10%
and electricity, which
when properly understood

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:10%
produces an anti-gravity effect.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The two men were Serbia
immigrant Nikola Tesla

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and the other was an
American whose name

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:90%
was Thomas Townsend Brown.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:10%
While much is known
about Tesla, very little

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:10%
is known about T Townsend Brown.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Tesla came to the
United States and began

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
working with Thomas Edison.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They had a disagreement about
direct current, which Edison

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
favored, and alternating
current, which Tesla favored

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and which has become
the standard today.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's experiments
with electricity

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
are very well known.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It is likely that both
Tesla and T Townsend

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Brown worked together on
the famous Philadelphia

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
experiment in which
it was discovered

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that large amounts
of electricity

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
could cause a ship to disappear
and possibly relocate.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
We know so much more
about Tesla than we

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:90%
do about T Townsend Brown.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And what did he do?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I was attending a
group we had in Oregon--

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:10%
Portland, Oregon--
called the Flatlanders.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They were sort of rebels,
scientific rebels.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I learned
about Townsend Brown.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:10%
And one fellow it took me--
he Xeroxed his whole file

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:10%
on Townsend Brown's work.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:90%
I thought, my god, this is true.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is
this correlation

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:90%
between charging gravity here.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Brown was researching
this way back as early

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.105 align:middle line:84%
as the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There appears to be a direct
relationship between electrical

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:90%
charge and gravity.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for this
to Biefeld-Brown effect.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:10%
This originated from the results
of Dr. Thomas Townsend Brown

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.217 align:middle line:10%
and then Dr. Biefeld
applied it scientifically.

00:07:21.217 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> He would charge a
capacitor to 100,000 volts.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would be suspended
from the ceiling

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and find it would move towards
the positively charged side.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:90%
He calls this electrogravitics.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Brown's basic discovery
is actually quite simple.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
If you take a piece
of electrical material

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and charge it to
a very high level,

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:84%
you will get
gravitational thrust

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:90%
coming off of that metal.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.713 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you have a disk that

00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
has a negative
plate on the bottom

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and a positive anode on
top, you will get thrust

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:90%
in an upward direction.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can create what's
called unbalanced forces

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
on the capacitor, so that
the charge on one side

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
of the capacitor pushes
on the capacitor one way,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
a different amount than the
other charges push the other

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
way, the capacitor
is going to move.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And Brown found
that this happens

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in asymmetrical capacitors
where one plate is small

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.053 align:middle line:90%
and the other is very large.

00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So he had these things
that look like a flying

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
saucer-like umbrellas for
one plate and the other

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:90%
would be a ball.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing would lift.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
He was able to get this to
lift its own weight plus 10%

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:90%
extra weight, quite amazingly.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Now this is just part of-- a
small part of Brown's research

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
He also got into
electrokinetics.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The gravitational flow
going into the black hole has

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:84%
the same flux equations
as the physics of an atom.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, during the
war, what was he doing?

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:90%
You know, they say radar work.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It was at the time of the
Philadelphia experiment.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of rumors
that he was on this.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has never denied it
when people would ask him.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.407 align:middle line:84%
He would not say, but
he would not deny it.

00:09:17.407 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> There's only one field.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And we've been tricked
into thinking that gravity

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is one thing and electrical
energy is something else,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
go hand in hand.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Brown was highly respected.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
He worked in a Naval
research laboratory.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
He had very strong
connections with the military.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
He made demonstrations
of some disks to the Navy

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
out at Pearl Harbor that
reportedly were flying

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:90%
at hundreds of miles per hour.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>> So what happens is the
classified world takes these,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:10%
classifies those technologies,
and, essentially,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.553 align:middle line:10%
runs away with them preventing
the rest of the world--

00:09:52.553 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:10%
literally, preventing the rest
of the world, through legal

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:10%
means, from developing
those types of technologies.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking forms
of electrogravitics,

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
propulsion technologies,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.495 align:middle line:84%
gravitational
propulsion technologies.

00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only when you start
working in very high amperage

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
conditions, like what Nikola
Tesla was working on, Dr.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Townsend Brown, and the
Germans with the Bell tech that

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:10%
you now have gravitational
vectors coming off that

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.985 align:middle line:10%
electrostatic charge.

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So what's fascinating about
this is Dr. Thomas Townsend

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Brown was developing this
technology back in the 1920s.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.425 align:middle line:90%
That's like 100 years ago.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And then later, it was
co-oped by the Germans

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and other groups
which then began

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.565 align:middle line:90%
to develop this technology.

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we can see and
understand how electricity

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and gravity can form a field
that can be manipulated.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Objects can be moved
around, even in a vacuum.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
When we ask the question, are
there any other researchers

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
looking into this
connection, we discovered

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
the work of Nikolai Kozyrev.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Torsion as a term in physics
for the rotation and twisting

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of the lattice
structure of spacetime.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.965 align:middle line:90%
That's it in a nutshell.

00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:19.472 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.472 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a branch of science
in Russian astrophysics that

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
was largely pioneered
by Nikolai Kozyrev.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's called torsion fields.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Kozyrev noticed that if
the standard model of the sun,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:10%
or any other star,
as being a big,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:10%
huge chained up
hydrogen bomb, you know,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:10%
perpetually exploding and then
collapsing in on itself again,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:10%
that if that model were true,
then the sun should be spitting

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:10%
out much more
neutrino radiation.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Torsion fields are a very
unique and bizarre phenomena,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
because they are an unseen
force that are ignored

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:90%
by conventional science.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the
time of Isaac Newton,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
gravity was working just
fine before the apple

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
fell on his head.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Before gravity was defined,
we literally just ignored it.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
In much the same
way, torsion fields

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
are a basic force
of the universe.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And Kozyrev demonstrated
it conclusively.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Kozyrev began to think,
well, this means that the sun--

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and this is why I personally
think nuclear bombs,

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:10%
particularly hydrogen bombs,
are accessing some other form

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:10%
of energy because this
is what Kozyrev came to.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And what he came to
was, well, the sun

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
is-- because of certain features
of this differential rotation

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of the plasma under
electromagnetic stress,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:84%
what you have here
is an open system.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is literally
coupled to the other elements

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
of that system, namely, the
planets in their orbits,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
their angular momenta, inertial
mass, and so on and so forth,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that all feed into this open
system and this gating energy.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Kozyrev found different
ways to measure these forces.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you had a pendulum

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
with 10 grams of weight on one
side and one gram on the other

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were on a
string, the pendulum

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
would then swing in the
direction of the torsion field

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
just by vibrating the
top of the string.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
In that way, the
actual pendulum would

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
be very sensitive to the
effect of the torsion fields.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That energy is going to
vary over time depending upon

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the geometrical
configuration of local space.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> He found that mechanical
processes could generate

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:90%
torsion field.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Kozyrev begins
to investigate this.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And he concludes that this
energy is coming from time.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:10%
>> But one day, he's
reading Goethe's book

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:10%
on the "Temptation of Faust"
by the devil Mephistopheles.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, he
had an emotional reaction.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And the needle points
directly at him.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Then he realized
that consciousness

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
could create a torsion
field in the same way

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:90%
that mechanical forces can.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>> He begins to
investigate this.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And something interesting
happens, because he's roundly

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:10%
denounced in Pravda for being
a quack, a mountebank, a fraud.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And he sort of disappears.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And then after the fall of the
Soviet Union, lo and behold,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
we discover that what
Kozyrev was actually doing

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
was extremely top secret
work for the Soviet

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Union in torsion physics.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
If you really dig in the record,
all the indicators are there.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Nazis are working
in torsion physics.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
The Russians are working
in torsion physics.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The Russians are
detonating their H-bombs.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, they're
getting probably runaway yields

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:90%
from their calculations.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And oh, there's this
astrophysicist over here

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that's been talking
about the sun

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's not performing properly
according to the predictions

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:90%
of general relativity.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll shuffle
him off the stage

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and put him to work on figuring
out just what the heck is going

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
on here, because we can't have
our bombs blowing up the world.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
We only want to blow
up the Americans.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:10%
The Pravda article
denouncing him was,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:10%
I think, probably
for the purpose

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:10%
of creating a convenient
cover to shuffle him off

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:10%
into some Soviet black project.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of
the thermonuclear era,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
they began to realize
that they were dealing,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
not just with
thermonuclear physics,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
they were dealing with
a much deeper physics

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and that they had
to explore this.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What is going on
inside of an atom?

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a positively charged
nucleus and a negatively

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:90%
charged electron cloud.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The idea that
there is a particle

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
called an electron is
totally theoretical.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.535 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
the clouds exist.

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
That means that
the electron clouds

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
are in flux around the
positively charged nucleus.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We're also dealing with
the flow of current

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and the flow of
the current, as we

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
saw with Dr. Brown's research,
is of gravitational flow.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the flow of gravity
and the flow of electricity

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:90%
run together.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
actual atom itself

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
is made of a gravitational flow.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The two are fundamentally
intertwined.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why an
electrical current creates

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:90%
a gravitational current.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's now surmise
that gravity is

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the energy that is
flowing into the earth

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to create the earth
moment by moment.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We call it the pull of
gravity, but that may be wrong.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It's pushing down on us
and it blows through us

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
because it also is flowing
into us at a much smaller rate.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens is you
have various means by which you

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
can get spin in this
fluid-like energy that

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
is making the earth.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So a spin in gravity is
called a torsion field.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The torsion field is
actually the equivalent

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of a wave that moves through
the gravitational field

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:90%
as an impulse.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Or, in other words, it's a spin.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What really intrigues
me about all this is

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
it's precisely in
the middle 1950s,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
as all of this is going on
as Nick Cook points out,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that anti-gravity talk
in the open literature,

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.559 align:middle line:84%
be it popular or
scientific, just dies.

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> This is exactly true.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:10%
In the early to
mid-1950s, there was

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:10%
a brief flurry within the United
States' public media of talk

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:10%
about anti-gravity
and how we were

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:10%
very close to achieving
breakthroughs in this,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.143 align:middle line:10%
essentially, flying
saucer technology.

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.643 align:middle line:10%
And all of this was
being discussed.

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:10%
And then it did stop abruptly.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.967 align:middle line:90%
End of 1955 is when it ended.

00:17:49.967 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of different scientists
who claimed to have developed

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
these anti-gravity technologies
find that there is a strange

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
effect on people's consciousness
when they are near them.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
in an exotic state,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
almost like a psychedelic
has been given to them.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a very strange
interrelationship

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
between these technologies
and consciousness.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And we know the stories of
Morgan and Tesla and Morgan

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:90%
suppressing Tesla.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
it's because Morgan was

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:90%
an inherently bad guy alone.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:90%
He was an inherently bad guy.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
he's probably got advisors

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
telling him, well, if this
guy lets this technology out,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:84%
it could be turned into
a really bad weapon

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that basically
anybody can build.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>> There are obvious reasons
why the US government

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and the Russian government
want to suppress torsion field

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:10%
technology.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's be clear.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
The application
of this technology

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:90%
is not totally benevolent.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They are extraordinarily
dubious things

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.100 align:middle line:90%
that can be done with it.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And on the other hand, it
would be the end of our power.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
How do we transition
to this next thing

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
without losing control
and having everything

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
go to heck in a handbasket
and blow ourselves up

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:90%
in the process?

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The torsion field is the
ultimate key to the unified

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.040 align:middle line:84%
model of physics where we
can now link consciousness,

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
technology, and physics together
in the greater totality.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The elites within the United
States military have known

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
about these forces
since the 1920s.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
What the Germans were working
on during the same time period

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
remained a secret until
long after the war ended.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:10%
In 1989, the Berlin
Wall fell and documents

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:10%
began leaking out of the
former communist countries.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:10%
Many of these documents
had never been seen before.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, a large
group of documents

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
were discovered in
Poland, which tell

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting story
about a fascinating object

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%
called the Bell.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bell is an interesting
story that has come out.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
stories, incidentally,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that's come out since
the German [GERMAN],,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:90%
the German reunification.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a story that,
in my opinion,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:10%
lies at the very center of
the Nazi UFO myth, this idea

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:10%
that the Nazis had field
propulsion flying saucers.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And they took secret
trips to the moon and Mars

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bell is a
propulsion system.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
it's basically a
kind of reactor.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And that reactor
is the power source

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:90%
for a thing called the Haunebu.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This SS-Gruppenführer's
name is Jakob Sporrenberg.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:10%
And he was tried by a
Polish war crimes court

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:10%
after the war for the crime of
having murdered 60 Germans that

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:10%
were part of this project
in order to keep it secret.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And in his affidavit before
the Polish war crimes court,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
he describes details
of this project

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:90%
called Die Glocke, The Bell.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
He describes a device
that's bell shaped.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about 12-15 feet
high, if I remember.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's about
maybe 12 feet wide.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It's bell shaped.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's described in
terms that make

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
you think it's either a ceramic
cover or a ceramic metal.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's cryogenically cooled either
with liquid helium or liquid

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
oxygen, something that's
going to super cool it.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And on the inside
of this device,

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
there are two
rotating cylinders.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Sporrenberg describes
that they poured

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
into these
counter-rotating cylinders

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
a substance called
serum-525, which

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
was described in the
affidavit, supposedly,

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
as a very heavy, dense,
viscous, gooey metal that

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
was a deep maroon
or cherry red color.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
There were enough details that
you could sit down and kind

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
of reverse engineer the
thinking, the physics thinking,

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans may have
been employing in this device.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We've heard from a number
of experts about the Germans

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and their technology.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And the documentation
coming forth

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
shows that they were
using a red mercury.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, red mercury
is very interesting

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
because when you put it
into a torus energy field

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and get it up to
about 60,000 RPMs

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.697 align:middle line:84%
with an atmospheric
pressure of 250,000

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and applying an
electromagnetic field,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:90%
you get anti-gravity properties.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So this serum-525 is put
into these counter-rotating

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:90%
cylinders.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.427 align:middle line:84%
And they're spun up to high
speed in opposite directions.

00:22:37.427 --> 00:22:38.885 align:middle line:84%
And what this is
going to do-- just

00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:40.802 align:middle line:84%
to explain a bit of the
physics for a moment--

00:22:40.802 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cohere the
rotation of the atoms

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and molecules of this
substance on one plane.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it's going
to align the axis of rotation

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Sporrenberg also describes
that it makes a buzzing sound

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:90%
or a hissing sound.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans actually
nicknamed it apparently.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They nicknamed this device
[GERMAN],, the beehive,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:90%
because it's buzzing.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:10%
It's making this buzz.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was studying
Delschau's artwork,

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:10%
I saw something
that was stunning.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
This had to do with the
propulsion system, the energy

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
system, for one of these
aeros from the 1850s.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:10%
And what it was was
something that Delschau

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:10%
identifies as a generator cone.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And it rotates, spins,
on a central axis

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:90%
that it's fixed to.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And this mystery
fuel, liquid fuel,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:10%
is injected into the process.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, the shape of
this thing is the shape

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:10%
of a common shape of a bell.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:10%
My jaw dropped because
you're talking about Germans.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
spinning, bell-shaped object

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
with a secretive
liquid fuel serum.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Here was this same exact basic
concept in the 1850s that

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Delschau-- clearly
in the 1890s--

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
included in one of his drawings.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We have indications that the
Germans are experimenting with

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
some substance that is
being zapped with lots

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And right there,
that tells me plasma.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
The substance is heavy.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's liquid.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's red.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me it's
probably metallic.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's probably an
oxide of mercury

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and something else
in chemical compound.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So what they're
creating, in effect,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:90%
is a version of the sun.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Because the sun's a plasma.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
It's under
electromagnetic stress.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got the differential
rotation of the plasma.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to create
what physicists call torsion.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that the bell
device is a device designed

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
by mimicking the sun to create
a maximum torsion shear effect.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
it's going to create

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
a kind of magnetic
bubble or cancellation

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of the gravitational field.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this is what
is reported of The Bell

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
because the concentration
camp victims, who apparently

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
saw this being tested
at night on the surface,

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
saw something that looked like
a barrel glowing a pale blue,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
rising, kind of levitating,
and then falling

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:90%
back down below the treeline.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The Haunebu is
your classic UFO.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Looks like a UFO that you've
seen in 1,000 magazines.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So they developed the
Haunebu around The Bell.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And they had to shield the
Haunebu because The Bell gives

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:84%
off so much radiation, and
heat, and a lot of other things.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of the war, the
Nazis executed the scientists

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and technicians, the
middle echelon scientists

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and technicians, involved with
the project to keep it from

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
falling into the hands of
the Russians and the Allies.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:10%
I think aspects of this
project ended up in Argentina

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:10%
and were experimented upon
under independent Nazi control

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.133 align:middle line:10%
even after the war.

00:26:16.133 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is very logical,
because if you've

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
got that kind of technology,
the atom bomb is kind of--

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] it's kind of
the Model T technology.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You can give that to
the Americans, you know?

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But this we're going
to keep for ourselves.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
work on this more.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what they did.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
All of this adds up to me
that they are experimenting

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
with a prototypical
kind of proof

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
of concept torsion technology,
field propulsion technology.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> These technologies were
combined together to develop

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
a working flying saucer
significantly in advance of any

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:90%
other technologies.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.723 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, if you
look at the Roswell incident

00:26:54.723 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
in 1947, the Germans had
a 10-year head start.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Before his death
in 1995, Ben Rich,

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:10%
the father of the stealth
bomber and head of Lockheed

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:10%
Martin's top secret Skunk
Works Research Facilities,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:10%
said this to a group of
people after a speech.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> "We already have the means
to travel amongst the stars,

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but these technologies are
locked up in black projects

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and it would take an act of God
to ever get them out to benefit

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can imagine,
we already know how to do."

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In our next episode, we will
examine the idea that if there

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is a secret space program
with advanced technologies,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
then is there a possibility that
these technologies could create

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
a separate civilization to ours?

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:90%
