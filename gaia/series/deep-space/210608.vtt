>> The famous UFO crashes of the
1940s like the one in Roswell,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, are often associated
with the extraterrestrials

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
commonly referred
to as the Greys.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was another
grey-colored species

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
who were involved with
those crash events.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They are referred to as
Extraterrestrial Biological

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Entities, or Ebens.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
These incidents, while
initially made public,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
underwent extreme
measures from government

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and military officials
to then cover them up.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Between captured ET
technologies and direct contacts

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
biological entities,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
government documents exist that
reveal the involvement of Ebens

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
within secret
undisclosed programs.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
What is our relationship
with the Ebens?

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And what do we know about their
involvement with humankind?

>> In 1947, there was a crash
in New Mexico near Roswell.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Involved two ET crafts.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
One crash near
Corona, New Mexico.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
A debris field was south
of that closer to Roswell.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
The second craft
crashed in Horse Mesa

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
way out west of Magdalena,
New Mexico, in the mountains.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Very remote area.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't found until 1949.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
The 1947 crash was
found by a rancher

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and an archaeological team.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological team
found the actual craft

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
with one live ET, which
we later called Ebe 1,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
and the other, the dead ETs.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
The debris field south of
there was found by another man,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and that debris field was
considered the antenna section

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Eben craft.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The craft was
transported eventually

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
onto Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base on Area 51.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The ET was transported to
Kirtland Field in Albuquerque,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, and then
later to Los Alamos,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because Los Alamos was
the only place that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
had a very secure facility
that they could house something

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
like an Eben, an
extraterrestrial.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I know about this
because I was actually

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
briefed in an official
briefing in 1979

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:90%
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I saw the film.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I was briefed by an
Air Force Colonel.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We were briefed in the
special access program.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So I know what I'm
saying is factual,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and I follow that up by saying
that I had other contacts who

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
have been involved in that
incident and can verify

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the same biological
entities were in both.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So we know that they
was the same ET Greys.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
Ebens had been visiting Earth

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:90%
prior to that?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm only telling you what I
know and what I had access to.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most respected
science journalists,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe, has
been reporting about UFOs

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and contact for many decades.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
She's been privy to
many government insiders

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and documents.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>> On that day on April 9, 1983,
I did not have the experience

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:10%
that I would have
20-some years later.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And those words,
extraterrestrial biological

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
entity, would end up in one
of the most important leaked

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
documents of all time called
the SOM1-01 training manual.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That training manual breaks
down extraterrestrial biological

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
entities into two types.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It is clearly a
government document.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:10%
It was printed in 1954 on
a government printing press

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:10%
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
That was tracked
down by Bob Wood

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
who was an aerospace engineer
confirming that SOM1-01 101 is

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
a legitimate document.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:10%
About a year after I had
left McDonnell Douglas,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:10%
Stan Friedman called me
up and he said, you know,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:10%
Bob, he says, I've got
a fax of a document that

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:10%
seems pretty interesting.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's a special
operations manual,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and are you interested
in authenticating it?

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I am.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Washington
where Don Berliner

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
had the special
operations manual,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and made high-quality
photographs of it

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.385 align:middle line:90%
and then replicated it.

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:02.465 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
that I wound up

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
being pretty convinced
that it was authentic,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
because I talked to a guy who
was in the public printing

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.463 align:middle line:84%
office, and he looked
at it and he said, well,

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
based on the
content, I'd say it's

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%
a hoax because of the title.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It was Extraterrestrial
Entities and Technology Recovery

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and Disposal.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:10%
Basically, it was
a summary of how

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.592 align:middle line:10%
we'd had a secret
program, Majestic-12,

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:10%
to recover the craft,
and what to do with-- how

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:10%
to keep the public in the dark
and where to send the bodies,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.483 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:10%
So I was in harmony with
the content of the document.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:10%
Figured this is
exactly what you would

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:10%
want to do if you want to
keep the public in the dark.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We've never had the
government of the United States

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
say in any kind of
a legal procedure,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
you are violating
national security.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:90%
This is not real.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:10%
So the SOM1-01 sits
out there as a leak

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:10%
that every person who has
investigated says it's real.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the types, it's
extraterrestrial biological

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's describing two types
with two different shaped heads

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and heights and weights,
but they're both

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
referred to as extraterrestrial
biological entities.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
United States government

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
from the Roswell years
in 1940s, World War II,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
they were using that phrase,
extraterrestrial biological

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:90%
entities, perhaps for a lot.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually over time,
there has been a reduction down

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that the Eben is a
very specific type,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and it is the one with
the pear-shaped head.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They can be grey, and people
will call things that are grey

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Greys.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:10%
But as far as I know, the
extraterrestrial biological

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:10%
entity in the SOM1-01 training
manual for military forces

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:10%
about, we're dealing with
extraterrestrial biological

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:10%
entities, there's a page and a
whole huge, important paragraph

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:10%
about how the media and the
public are never to know,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:10%
and how you avoid any
information getting

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:10%
to the public or the media.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:10%
That's all in this
SOM1-01 document.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
To me, that lays out
clearly that in the 1940s,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that was a general phrase,
extraterrestrial biological

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But by the 21st
century, there had

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
been the emergence of
so many different types

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that it could only be
applied to a small group,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that as far as I know, they
can be artificial intelligence

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:90%
or truly biological.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%

on extraterrestrial
involvement on Earth,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Tim shares his unique
perspective about the Ebens

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and their connection
to the Greys.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The Ebens are a different
species that also features

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
greyish skin.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Those two species come
from a relative star

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
system around
Orion, and they used

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to be at war with each other.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They also seem to
genetically be related,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
so they are kind of relatives
that don't necessarily

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:90%
like each other, so to speak.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
One theory was the
1947 crashes on US soil

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.235 align:middle line:84%
might very well be provoked by
the Greys because at that time,

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
in the 1940s, Ebens and
Greys have been at war,

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and people are reporting
different greyish figures.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But I assume that
we are speaking

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
about two different
species that have crashed,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and that might very well be
the Ebens in the 1947 crashes,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and probably also the Greys
in some other crashes.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:10%
>> So what I've been told from
clients under hypnosis is that

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:10%
there was a war going on
between the regular Greys

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:10%
and the Ebens, and that was
because the Greys are very

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:10%
particular when it comes
to their hierarchy.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Ebens are
a type of Grey.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They're just more
physically focused,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
unlike the Greys that
use avatar bodies.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
The regular Greys feels if the
Ebens are inferior to them.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
There was a war going
on for quite some time

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
until both groups
realized they needed

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to agree to disagree
because Earth's evolution is

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.115 align:middle line:90%
more important at this time.

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Ebe 1, who was kept in
captivity in a deep underground

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:10%
base, was examined by the
military's top experts.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
After several attempts to
communicate with the being,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
a group of linguists and
communication specialists

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
were able to ascertain
who the Ebens were

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and from where they came.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Ever since they landed in
'47, there's a long story about

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
how Ebe was able to communicate.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We initially didn't
allow Ebe to have

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
any access to the equipment
on the recovered craft

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:90%
from Corona.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.222 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't let him see it.

00:10:25.222 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't let him touch it.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't let him go near it.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It was an entirely
different place.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We did have what was later
determined to be the energy

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
device and another
device which we later

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
determined to be the
communications device.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We did have that at Los Alamos
because they were studying it.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos scientists thought
the Plexiglas-looking thing

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:90%
was just a window.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They didn't realize it
was an energy device.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The other contraption, which
was very strange in appearance--

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I only saw a diagram of it.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ever see
the real thing.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It was an oblong-shaped
block of something

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:90%
that had different appenditures.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.833 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
at first that that

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
might have been some
sort of an energy device,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
but they could never
get it to activate.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out that was
a communications device.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The Plexiglas area or
the crystal rectangle,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
they call it, was
the energy device.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually somebody decided,
let's bring these into him

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:90%
and let him look at it.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Then he explained
to the handler,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
this was a
communications device.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Somehow he started trying to
communicate with his planet,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:90%
sending signals.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I think back then,
they were figuring

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that he was sending these
signals to Zeta Reticuli, which

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%
is 38 light years away.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't sending
them to another planet.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He was sending to the closest
spaceship, closest Eben craft.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, the
signals came in,

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and they made some
sort of an arrangement.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And before Ebe
died, he showed us

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
how to use the
communications device.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
So when Ebe died--

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
November of 1952--

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
we were able to continue sending
signals on this communications

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:90%
device out to space.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Communications with the Ebens
continued for almost a decade,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence
teams involved received

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:90%
communications in return.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
This evolved into a top secret
program reported by researchers

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
as Project Serpo in
which the United States

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
government organized
an exchange program

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
beings that

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the desert
near Roswell, New Mexico.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
While the exact
number of participants

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
has never been agreed
upon by researchers,

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the report suggests that
anywhere between three to 12

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
specially trained military
personnel traveled

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
to a planet in the Zeta
Reticuli star system

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
called Serpo, over
39 light years away,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
in an exchange program
between humans and the Ebens.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We were getting
messages back within hours.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was determined
by our scientists

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that these messages weren't
coming from Zeta Reticuli

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:90%
38 light years away.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
They were coming a
lot closer, and they

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
were pinpointing that
they were probably

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
out near Neptune
or maybe Jupiter.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to crudely
offer an exchange program.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:90%
There were three astronauts.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The three that was chosen,
they were ex-military pilots.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
actually went to Serpo.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:43.668 align:middle line:84%
One died in Serpo, one
stayed, and one came back.

00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to
be gone for 10 years.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:90%
They left in 1965.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed
to be back in 1975.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, time periods of different
between Serpo and Earth.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:90%
The one came back 1978.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
He tells a story about Serpo.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They live in mud huts.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:90%
They were all one race.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
The planet had a high radiation.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
They had to wear
these thin suits

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
that the Ebens
made for them that

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
protected their skin from
radiation and wear sunglasses

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It never really got dark.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Both suns would somewhat
set and then rise again.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything was controlled
by a clock in the middle

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of their compound.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
When a bell rang, they'd have
to go to dinner, breakfast.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
There was one huge
dining facility

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
for that particular
village that they lived in.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Everybody ate at the same place.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It took them a long time
to adjust to the food.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Climate they were
usually living in

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
was 110, 115 degrees
24 hours a day.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
They moved to a climate that
was between 60 and 80 degrees,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.878 align:middle line:84%
and they were more
adaptable to that climate.

00:14:46.878 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:90%
They interacted with the Ebens.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
They learned the Eben language.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:84%
To the best of our knowledge,
the one man that stayed there,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
he had interacted
with an Eben woman.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
She was one of
their controllers.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
She could speak English.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
She had spent time on Earth.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
She was able to facilitate
things that they needed.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What we know about the
extraterrestrial biological

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:84%
entities has either come through
Freedom of Information-accessed

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
documents released from
government agencies or from

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
the eyewitness experiences
reported around the world.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Through the collective
efforts of researchers

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.920 align:middle line:84%
across many countries,
we've gained

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
some ideas about
who the Ebens are,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
what their agendas might
be, and some understanding

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:84%
about their advanced
technologies.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:10%
>> If we go back to the
work of Colonel Corso,

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:10%
they did give us
certain technologies,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:10%
maybe night vision goggles.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the beings were
autopsied by the US government.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It seemed that their
eyes actually had

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:90%
these lenses that were unique.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
fiber optic cable

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
was a possibility coming from
extraterrestrial technologies.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Also, some people claim
not lasers per se,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
because we were already
working on lasers,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
but the sophisticated
technology was

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
gained from
extraterrestrial influence.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
lot of information

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that was given to our government
from these extraterrestrial

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:90%
biological entities.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens seemed
to also communicate

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.640 align:middle line:84%
like many of the other
extraterrestrials in terms

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
of telepathy, but
they can also project

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that thought into our
minds, even if we don't

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
consider ourselves telepathic.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, they
seem to have longer lifespans.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
They eat mainly by rubbing
something on their flesh

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
like an algae type
of substance that

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:90%
then goes into their bodies.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.835 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have the
mouth to swallow that we have.

00:16:58.835 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1980s, shortly
after taking office,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
US President Ronald Reagan
requested a briefing on the ET

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:84%
presence here on Earth by the
then CIA Director Williams

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Cayce.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Through leaked
documents, we learned

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
about a piece of
technology that the Ebens

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
used called the Yellow
Book, which allows the user

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to see a holographic
representation

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
of the entire history of
the Ebens' involvement

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:90%
with humankind.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Ebe 1 talks about something
that was in their craft that we

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:90%
hadn't found.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Somebody figured it was
some form of a book.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So they gathered
up all this stuff

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and they sent it
out to Los Alamos,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and they took it in to Ebe
1, and they laid it down.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And Ebe 1 pointed
to this one object.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you pick it up
and hold it in your hands,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:90%
yellow lines appear.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit there and look at
it, you start seeing pictures.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And along with the
pictures, you hear words.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I ever heard
about the Yellow Book was from

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Bob Lazar.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Bob Lazar had been exposed
as well as John Lear

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and other people to
this notion that one

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of the technologies that we
had found in one of the crash

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
crafts was the Yellow Book.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The way I've
understood it is you

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
have to be educated about
how you place your fingers.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
If you know the patterns of
how you hold the rectangle,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
you can make it come
up in a 3D hologram.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
In the pages is the whole
history of our planet,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and also a history of what
would be Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
If you hold the
Yellow Book one way

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
with the fingers
in one position,

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:90%
you can read it in English.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
If you turn it upside
down and do this, you then

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
access the Zeta Reticuli
planet, that both worlds,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
both civilizations are
encompassed in the Yellow Book.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The way it has been
described to me

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:90%
is it's got a white background.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
The words glow yellow.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Wherever your eye is,
you can slow it down.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:90%
You can make it accelerate.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't touch anything.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You do it with your
mind and your eye.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Yellow Book
glowing will continue

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to move in English if that's
the configuration you are in.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Then if you want to look
at the holograms that

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
go with what you're
reading, there

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
is something that you have
to do with your fingers,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and then it will move
from a white background

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
with glowing yellow
letters and will come up

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%
into images that are full 3D.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's Eben history.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It goes back thousands
and thousands of years,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:90%
but it's in pictures.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The most incredible
part about it

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is regardless of what
language you speak,

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
when you sit there
and look at it,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:90%
you hear it in your language.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And we have it.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.695 align:middle line:84%
It's with the artifacts
in Los Alamos.

00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to
the Yellow Book,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Ebe 1 disclosed a number of
other devices that were aboard

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
his ship, including the
technology his species used

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to travel through
space and time.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main
questions asked was,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
how do you travel across
light years to get here?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
At some point, we figured out it
took them nine months to travel

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
from their star system to ours.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
He just said, we're
on one point here.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
We just fold over, and now
we're here at your point.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
What he explained I think
scientists now understand

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is folding the fabric of space.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how they travel.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They travel in a
period of time that

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is significantly
shorter than it would

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.425 align:middle line:90%
have taken to go light speed.

00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The late John Lear,
a former CIA pilot,

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
shared with us in a previous
interview that he had spent

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
some of his career working
at Area 51 with Bob Lazar.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Lazar brought to the world
information about Element 115,

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
an element not found on
Earth, that contributes

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:90%
to anti-gravitic space travel.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
anti-matter reactor,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it sits
in the middle of the craft.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I drew these to better
explain what Bob told me

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:90%
how the craft worked.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the craft,
and the little orange spot

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
is where the
anti-matter reactor is.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
These are the
gravity amplifiers.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they shoot
protons into the 115, which

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.755 align:middle line:90%
bumps it up to 116--

00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>> 116, right.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --which show off
the anti-matter,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:84%
which is mixed with matter, and
through a thermionic generator

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
creates voltage out of heat.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They then take-- they
are able to grasp

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the gravity A wave, which
is available as the 116 is

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
going back to 115.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
take it through the--

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:84%
up to the center of the
craft and down to the sides

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and into the gravity amplifiers.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Then focus on a point in
space and then increase

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:10%
the attractiveness
of the amplifiers,

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:10%
increase the
amplification that pulls

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:10%
that space towards the craft.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:10%
It wraps around the craft,
and then they turn it off,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:10%
and they're instantly hundreds
of thousands of miles away.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:10%
I think the recharge
rate is 12 milliseconds.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So they can do that every
12 milliseconds, so you

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:90%
can go a long, long ways.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.123 align:middle line:10%
This shows a craft
and the distance in--

00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Fabric of time and space.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Fabric in space--

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:10%
holding it toward you with
the gravity amplifiers

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:10%
and wrapping it around
the craft like that.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:10%
And then they turn off
the gravity amplifiers.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Then you snap back.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't actually snap back.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You are back to where you
withdrew that space from.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:10%
There is no traveling
or anything like that.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:10%
You are back there where you
withdrew that space from.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's no feeling
of motion or anything.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:10%
>> While it's unclear exactly
when extraterrestrials began

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:10%
to influence planet Earth, some
researchers suggest they first

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:10%
appeared thousands of years ago,
placing them directly alongside

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:10%
the evolution of humanity.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, could
the Ebens have had a hand

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:90%
in our evolution as a species?

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The Ebens have visited Earth.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They were here about
2,000 years ago.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
They did exploration.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
They interacted with humans.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Then over the period
of thousands of years,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
they explored
other star systems,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
visited planets that
were uninhabited,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
planets that were inhabited.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So they've been around, and
they know at least our galaxy.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In April 1983, Linda
Moulton Howe was contracted

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
for a television documentary
on the UFO phenomenon.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Her producer set up a meeting
at Kirkland Air Force Base

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:90%
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It was there where
she met with Air Force

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special Investigations
Agent Richard C. Doty.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We started a discussion, and
then he directed me and said,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move from
the chair you're in.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move
to that chair.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was right in the
middle of this huge office.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else around
it but the chair.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can read the
document, and he's pulling out

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:90%
about a dozen typed pages.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And he hands them to me.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can read this,
but you cannot take notes.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:84%
My superior officers have
asked me to show this to you.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at a front cover
letter, all caps, briefing

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
paper for the president of
the United States of America

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
unidentified aerial craft.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:90%
No date.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.125 align:middle line:90%
No origination office.

00:26:16.125 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
When I turned, I was then
reading history, this page,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
this page, history of
things like sign and grudge.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm about the
third or fourth page in,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to read
fast and ask questions,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and I came to a
paragraph that said

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
quite literally, "These
extraterrestrial biological

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
entities--" that's our
translation now of Eben.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were Eben
or not is not clear

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.850 align:middle line:90%
because those are the words.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:84%
"These extraterrestrial
biological entities

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:84%
manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:03.865 align:middle line:90%
to create Homo sapiens."

00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the next sentences
were about what I assumed

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:90%
to be the avatars of history.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
sentence in that paragraph

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
was, "But the humans
killed all three."

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And I read that
paragraph over and over,

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and the paper continued
into a lot of history

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
and our government

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and interfering with atomic
this and projects that.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And got back down to
the last two pages,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and the top one
said, Project Garnet.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying,
remember your birth date.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I was born in January,
and it's a garnet.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:90%
"Project Garnet.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
All questions and mysteries
about the evolution

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of Homo sapiens on this
planet have been answered,

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:90%
and this project is closed."

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I remember that I read that
paragraph over and over

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and over like the other one.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:10%
The final implication
of that day

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:10%
is that the government had
a lot of information that

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:10%
had been condensed
into that briefing

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:10%
paper in which the
bottom line, whether it

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:10%
was the president, the
secretary of Defense,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.876 align:middle line:10%
or a humble reporter
from Denver that I,

00:28:45.876 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:10%
you, all Homo
sapiens sapiens were

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:10%
the result of genetic
manipulation of already

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:55.725 align:middle line:10%
evolving primates.

00:28:55.725 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:84%
If the government of the United
States knows this to be a fact,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:84%
why are they not telling
the American people?

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> How can the government come
out and say, you know what?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We've been lying to
you for 70 years.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
We've had ETs in captivity.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:90%
We've had ETs killed by humans.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
We've had spaceships
reverse engineered.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:84%
We would open up Pandora's box,
and that's not going to happen.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I think there'll be
limited disclosure.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll come out and
say, yeah, we probably

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
had ETs in the past
visiting Earth.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We can't explain everything
that's out there,

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but that's all we're
going to tell you.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether extraterrestrial
biological entities have been

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
visiting us for thousands of
years, as some experts suggest,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
or we've only had contact with
them since the UFO crashes

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico from the 1940s,
evidence of their existence can

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:90%
no longer be denied.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But the question
before us remains,

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
are the Ebens here to
help humanity evolve,

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:90%
or is there some other agenda?

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Either way, how will
an open disclosure

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
affect humankind as
we look to the future

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
only to realize the events
and all the other species

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
of the galactic family
are looking back?

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Join us next time
when we explore

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:84%
one of the Galactic Federation's
founders, the Andromedans.
