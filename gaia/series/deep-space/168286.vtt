00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Called the San Luis Valley,
it sits at over 8,000 feet

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:90%
above sea level.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
The valley has been
known for a long time

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.243 align:middle line:84%
to be a place where many
strange events occur.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It has been rumored
that there are

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
portals to other
dimensions in the valley.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in
this mysterious valley?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The San Luis Valley is
in south-central Colorado.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:10%
And it actually,
geologically, it

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:10%
extends down to
Taos, New Mexico.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So it does actually go below
the Colorado, New Mexico border.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
However, the Colorado portion
is known as the San Luis Valley.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
The lower portion is
not, even though it is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
part of the same valley system.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When I say window area, I
mean a place that seems to have

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
a preponderance of paranormal
activity, be it UFOs, Bigfoot,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:90%
poltergeist activity, whatever.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:10%
And often, strangely
enough-- and a lot

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:10%
of people probably watching
know this-- all those things

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:10%
that once.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:10%
>> We describe it as the
playground of the paranormal

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:10%
because not only are the
deposits just enormously vast

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:10%
there, but you have daily
nonstop paranormal activity

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.657 align:middle line:10%
occurring.

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot
that's unusual there.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the geophysical
properties, I think,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.777 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important things to look at.

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the few
areas where you'll

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
have large pockets of
magnetic energy, maximum field

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
strength, and minimum
field strength

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
right next to one another.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:10%
And when you have that
close proximity of minimum

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:10%
and maximum field
strength, it sets up

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:10%
vortices of
electromagnetic energy.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.425 align:middle line:84%
And where you have the
minimum intensity areas,

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
you also have
intermittent layers

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:90%
of clay, sand, and water.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a
perfect natural battery.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have a variety of
gravitic lows close proximity

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:90%
of field strength.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Portals are actually
different areas.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They're also
described as vortexes.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the portals that
we've gone to examine

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
are all in places that the
indigenous people hold sacred.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
There's always an oral history
in those indigenous tribes,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
some strange
happenings going on.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We believe that what's
causing the portals, which

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
are a tear in the electric
membrane that separates

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, are
vast quartz crystal

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
deposits underneath
the topography,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that these deposits actually
generate electromagnetic fields

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
so strong that they can
cause a momentary rip

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
or tear in that membrane.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
that tear occurring,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you have momentary interaction
between dimensions.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And we describe that
as being paranormal.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's just the
tip of the iceberg on some

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:90%
of the things that go on there.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
the location, it's

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the only area in North America
where three regional groups

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.145 align:middle line:90%
of Indians overlapped.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
The Great Plains
Indians would go there

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.582 align:middle line:84%
during the summer, the Great
Basin Indians, the nomadic Ute,

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and the
Kiowa and the Comanche.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:10%
And those 13 different
tribes ended up

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:10%
using the valley and the
southwestern Indians.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Navajo, the
DinÃ© people, the Apache,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.943 align:middle line:84%
and even the Hopi would
make vision quests up there.

00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's the only spot
in America that we

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
can say that three
regional groups overlapped.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.077 align:middle line:90%
It's so isolated.

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand it's the
world's largest alpine valley.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It's completely surrounded
and ringed by mountains.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.337 align:middle line:90%
It's roughly football-shaped.

00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You have the Sangre de Cristo,
the longest continuous mountain

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
range in North America, going
up the east side, which is also

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the largest volcanic thrust
fault in the interior

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It goes from the Gulf
of Mexico to Leadville.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And it follows the Sangres,
or the middle portion of it.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the San Juan Mountains

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.775 align:middle line:90%
are on the west side.

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely
surrounded by mountains.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, it's radar

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.218 align:middle line:90%
invisible below 18,000 feet.

00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
There's no monitoring
of the airspace

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
below that particular altitude.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pretty much any type
of paranormal phenomenon

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that you can stick
your finger on

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
has occurred there, including
crop circles in the early '70s.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the most
significant factors--

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
four different indigenous tribes
that describe the San Luis

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Valley as being
their garden of Eden,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the holiest mountain
there being Mount Blanca,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
which is a 14,000-foot
mountain peak,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
which some of the Indians claim
actually have crystal skulls

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:90%
buried on, which is fascinating.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was in that
valley where they

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
described what's
called the sipapu,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:90%
or the place of emergence.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
This was a hole in the
ground that they literally

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
crawled up into this existence.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
down there, they

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.627 align:middle line:84%
claimed the Ant People
were taking care of them.

00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
The San Luis Valley, which
is where Crestone is,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
for about 20 years, we've
done 85 expeditions there.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:10%
And dating back certainly
to Native American times

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:10%
and old ranchers from
the 18th, early 19th,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:10%
they reported seeing unusual
phenomena and objects that

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:10%
come up out of the
Earth and go into space

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of things.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Now when I first started going
there in '93, 24 years ago,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:84%
we immediately had amazing
contact experiences.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I also noticed that there
was a magnetic field anomaly

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
there, where the delta, the
change in magnetic field

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
is very dramatic in that area.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to have some
effect on facilitating,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
or, at least, having
expressed that we're

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
seeing it with the naked eye,
extraterrestrial phenomenon.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there's also the
third largest aquifer

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
in North America there,
underneath this valley.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And there is a great
deal of evidence

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that there is an ancient ET
presence within the aquifer.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're
transdimensional ETs.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:90%
They can come in and out.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have an amazing
photograph of one

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
coming out right in front of
us and shooting straight up

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and stopping.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing photograph.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Wherever you find the largest
quartz crystal deposits--

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
let's take, for example,
Sedona, Arizona--

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the mountain ranges
there, and you

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
study aero electromagnetic
mapping of the topography, what

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
you find is that the mountains
themselves literally exhibit

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields that
are up to 500 times more

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
powerful than the
surrounding countryside.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it takes to
cause a rip in that membrane

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and get that interdimensional
activity to occur.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the places where that
occurs almost on a daily basis

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
is the San Luis Valley.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the conditions
that you find there,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll occasionally see
piezoelectric discharges from

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:90%
the Sangres.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The Sangres are filled
with negative spaces

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
where quartz,
obviously, has grown.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's some rumors even
that Nikola Tesla came there

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
at one point to
investigate the discharging

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:90%
of the piezoelectric energy.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I have actually seen it
on a couple of occasions

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
late at night, super cold
winter nights with very

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:90%
low single digit humidity.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see these
flashes of light

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that come out of the mountains
and go up into the air.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.818 align:middle line:84%
And they separate
from the mountain

00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:90%
and go up into the air.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And on two occasions,
I've seen it.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It's really rare,
but it does occur.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what you have is a
scenario by which there are

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
areas like this where the fields
being generated are so powerful

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
that they're causing this
non-stop interaction with

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:90%
another dimension.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that can explain

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the wide array of paranormal
activity taking place

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
these fields exist

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
because they exist in a
very small geographic area

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Now today, it's almost
like the military slowly

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:84%
buying up these areas
where these portals exist.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're placing a guard
at the door of each one.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The valley first came
into prominence in the 1960s,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
when the first animal
mutilations occurred there.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
All through the
1960s, '70s, and '80s,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of cows and horses
were discovered mutilated

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
all through the valley.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.382 align:middle line:90%
What was going on with this?

00:08:29.382 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's interesting.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
animal mutilations

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
that started there were counter
intelligence operations.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what you find is that
wherever there is a genuine ET

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, the intelligence
community will try to put

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:90%
on top of it their take on it.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.273 align:middle line:84%
And there's a national
security agency guy

00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
who used to be the
right hand to General

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Odom, the head of the
National Security Agency,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:84%
did this man analyze the
Marilyn Monroe document for us.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And he says we call it DDT.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:90%
You set up a decoy.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a distraction and
then trashes the whole subject.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says we know very well
how to run a DDT operation.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And so wherever there is this ET
phenomenon that's ancient Earth

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
events, you will find that the
intelligence community will

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
often move in with
counterintelligence operations

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and do things that set people
off the scent of the real.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
spread a lot of fool's gold

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
along around so you don't
find the gold nugget.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
that started there.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The cattle thing is my least
favorite thing to investigate.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm very sensitive to
the welfare of animals

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and the sanctity of all life.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening to
these poor, poor animals?

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Somebody has going to be
helping these ranchers,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and nobody was helping them.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.632 align:middle line:84%
Law enforcement
couldn't do anything.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was no
scientific organizations

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.715 align:middle line:90%
that were interested in it.

00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
amount of aerial activity

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing, we
had major waves of UFOs

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.543 align:middle line:84%
from end of '92 all
the way to almost '99.

00:10:02.543 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So about a six,
seven-year period,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.655 align:middle line:84%
there were hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of sightings.

00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, Linda Howe
and Chuck Zukowski

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and other investigators
are very intrigued

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:84%
by the sensational side of this,
which only represents 2% to 5%

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:90%
of the data.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be quasi military.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I think it's multinational.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of like along
the lines of a militarized CDC

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
or NIH, the Centers
for Disease Control

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
or the National
Institutes of Health.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
There may be some sort of
secret clandestine branch of one

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
of those two
organizations or one

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.227 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know about that's
monitoring the environment.

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
good at what they do.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:84%
There's been a number of cases
where veterinary pathologists,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
world class veterinary
pathologists-- and I

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
don't use that term lightly.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
John Waterhouse
actually at Iowa State,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
he took a calf that was freshly
mutilated and discovered,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
quickly brought it
to the forensic lab

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
in the veterinary
college, and side

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
by side, duplicated the
cuts that were on the calf.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.465 align:middle line:90%
He was able to do them all.

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But he said whoever did the
ones that got the tongue out,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:84%
he said, man, whoever that
was, was really talented.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I am a world class surgeon.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.523 align:middle line:90%
And he actually even used that.

00:11:07.523 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if somebody
could duplicate what I did,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
these are really seasoned
professionals doing this.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, in your viewpoint,
could any of this stuff not

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
been done by humans?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And he said no.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, however, you have to
know exactly what you're doing.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able
do it very quickly.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be an
expert veterinarian

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and know anatomy
to the point where

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
you can do it in the dark.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Altshuler, who was
the only bona fide scientist

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.982 align:middle line:10%
in the early days
who looked into this,

00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:10%
who was a very good
friend of mine,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:10%
did the original Snippy the
Horse case in Colorado back

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:10%
in the '60s, late '60s.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:10%
He looked into this and
he came to the conclusion

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:10%
that they were paramilitary
human operations masquerading

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:10%
as alien that were doing this
for their psychological warfare

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:10%
value, but also to test
out systems and test

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:10%
human response, media
and human response.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly, they were
also getting raw materials

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
for some of their
underground bases and labs,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
where they were taking certain
parts of the animal that

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
had a high mitotic
index, meaning

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that the cells
reproduce quickly, like

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:84%
the tongue, the rectum, the
sex organs, and what have you,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
for things they were
doing that were hideous

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
experiments in
underground facilities.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Towering over the San
Luis Valley is Mount Blanca.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the fourth highest
mountain in Colorado.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The mountain, which frequently
is snow-covered all year long,

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
sacred mountains

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:90%
to the local Native Americans.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Right below Mount Blanca is the
Sand Dunes National Monument.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The Sand Dunes Monument
is one of the largest sand

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
dunes in the Americas.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, there are rumors
swirling that there's

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
a base of some kind
inside the mountain.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Some say it's a military base.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Others say it's alien.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:10%
Either way, Mount Blanca
has so many UFO sightings

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:10%
that there's even a UFO
watchtower, where viewers can

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:10%
come and watch the mountain.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Sacred mountain of the east
to the DinÃ©, Apache and Navajo,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:10%
Sisnaajini, it's a place
where all thought originates.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:10%
It's where creation occurs.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.425 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes around to the
north to Hesperus to the San

00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:10%
Francisco peaks in the west and
then Mount Taylor in the south.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Those are the four cardinal
mountains of the southwest.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Blanca is-- the
stories that I have

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:10%
uncovered from all the way
back in the pioneer days

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:10%
to just recently.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:90%
We've had Bigfoot reports.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:84%
We've had spectral
Indians attacking campers

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
around campfires, the old
King Ranch, the upper cabin.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:84%
A guy went by on
horseback, but he

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
would have had to been
on a horse 20 feet tall.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the other thing is that
the sacred mountain of the east

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:90%
is Blanca peak.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And all the Native American
tribes would gather there.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
We started going
there in '93, '94.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have a contact site
up in a remote location,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
where we go into another
dimension, and ETs appear.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know for a fact that
there is an ancient ET presence

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the, I think, second,
third, fourth highest peak

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado is Blanca peak.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, on
the south side of it,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
a man that had some land where
there was a medicine wheel.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:90%
And we did a CE5 there contact.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And this object came
out of the mountain.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was, like, a liquid blue.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it came down and
wrapped around us.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And then a rectangular
box materialized.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:90%
A woman almost sat on it.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
You could do such an
amazing series of things

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
just on the CSETI experience
and the San Luis Valley.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, for many years,
we've gone there.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's an
ancient presence in that area,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
just like at Mount Shasta
and that the sacred mountain

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of the east was a gathering
place where all the native

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:90%
peoples, they did not fight.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And the bloodless valley
was the San Luis Valley

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:90%
for the native peoples.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was because there
was an ancient connection

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
between these
interstellar civilizations

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and early Native American
people of that area.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's still that energy,
that presence is still there.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Although there was an
eradication attempt, now back

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
some years ago, I
had an emergency call

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
from a helicopter
line operator, who

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:84%
was called in on a mutual assist
on the eastern side of Blanca

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
peak, where there were
covert special forces that

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
were attempting to kill ETs
inside the mountain using nerve

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
agents or something like that.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And they had a mishap.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.557 align:middle line:84%
And some of their own people
were badly injured or killed.

00:15:51.557 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were calling
in mutual assist

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because he was running
the helicopter,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
checking power lines.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
This man, very credible
man, said he went in there.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were doing.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And we subsequently had
contact when we went there

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
with the ETs, who asked
that we do what we could

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to get this attack stopped.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:10%
So I did a thing
at the Pentagon,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:10%
where I was trying to get
that operation stopped.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:10%
But yes, I have tremendous
information about that.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:10%
I was there personally.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the helicopter pilot
that worked for the utility

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
company was flying,
checking the power lines.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was about ready to
fly back to the airport.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And he got an emergency
call from the military

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
from Fort Carson, saying, we've
had an accident on Blanca Peak.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:10%
We would need you to go
immediately there and evacuate

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:10%
wounded soldiers.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he's-- whoa,
this is intense.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why they call him,

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.307 align:middle line:84%
he says because you know the
local weather patterns there.

00:16:50.307 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That was the excuse,
the wind conditions.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So he flew over there, and
he's hovering over the site.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And he sees all these
guys, these troops

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:90%
in a wilderness area.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They're doing maneuvers
in a wilderness area.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:90%
So, on the north side of Blanca.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And he radioed in
and said, what is

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:90%
the nature of this emergency?

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I forget how they
couched it, but it

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
had something to do with
the daughters of sarin.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that?

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, what
do you mean, sarin?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
bring somebody that's

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
been hit with a nerve
agent inside my helicopter.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can just strap him to
your skids on your helicopter.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.954 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no way.

00:17:25.954 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going
to have to get

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.371 align:middle line:84%
your Black Hawks or your
Apaches to come get them

00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not going to do it.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So this was--

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
one of our objectives was
to try to stop the sort

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
of outrageous activities.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But the deep national security
rogue elements within Magic,

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the Majority
Intelligence Committee--

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
it used to be
called Majestic 12.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not called that anymore.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
There are ones that
are tremendously

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
rogue that do what
they want that don't

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
answer to any hierarchy.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And they will go places
where there is an ET presence

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.872 align:middle line:84%
and try to, quote,
"eradicate" them,

00:17:59.872 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
even though they've been
there thousands, maybe

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:90%
millions of years.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that Mount Shasta
is probably millions.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something of
very great concern to us.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we often do
expeditions to places

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
like that to have
another face of humanity

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:90%
shown that's peaceful.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:90%
We do this deliberately.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
We walk right into the
belly of the beast.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Now some people are kind
of appalled when I say,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
well, yes, of course,
we're going to do this.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
for dilettantes.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We do this with a very
serious peace initiative.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I will say that if you go up to
Zapata Falls, the parking area,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and we remote
viewed the location

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that if you get off the trail
off to the right and go up,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
there's an area, before you
get to the falls on the right,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
where we found a contact site
that's very easy to get to.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And you go up there.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:10%
And there are so many
amazing experiences

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:10%
we had, just amazing phenomena.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, the
interstellar civilizations

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
can be all around us and shifted
beyond the speed of light

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in the visible spectrum
and can just pop in.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And the entire person
or craft will just

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
be there instantaneously.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But you need to have the correct
kind of cameras and operators

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
in 360 to capture it.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And we've never had that.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
We do have some amazing
images and photographs,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
but we could have had much more.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Where else but Blanca?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.787 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all this
stuff is centered

00:19:27.787 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:90%
around this particular mountain.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And we've had everything from
people reporting white buffalos

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
at high mountain lakes
at almost 12,000 feet.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
In 1966, two hunters
saw a platypus

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
in one of the high
mountain lakes there.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Back in '65, '66,
into '67, there

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
were reports of these small
10 to 12-foot scout ships

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that were flying in
and out of Blanca

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and chasing people in the
highway in broad daylight

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and dive-bombing cars going
to the great sand dunes.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.585 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Snippy
case happened right

00:19:58.585 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
at the base of there.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And the mountain
is overlooking some

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
of the meadows that have some
of the earliest known evidence

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:90%
of humans in North America.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
When they did a study
of the great sand dunes,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
which is the most mysterious
sand dune desert in the world--

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
it's by far the highest altitude
desert, sand and desert.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's 700-feet high sand dunes,
49 square miles of sand.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The sand does not conform to
any of the silica in the valley.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different color.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It has completely different
constituent elements.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
After getting to know
the personnel out there

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
after 10 years, one of the chief
geologists finally told me,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
how it got there.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.567 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
do you tell people

00:20:40.567 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that prevailing westerly
winds are blowing sand

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
from the old Rio
Grande and piling up

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
in the crook in the mountain?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, gotta
tell them something.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But the most mindblowing
thing about the sand dunes

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.183 align:middle line:90%
is they did a core sample test.

00:20:55.183 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were drilling down
in the very center of the dune

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they got to the bottom
of the dunes 700 feet down,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
they hit wood.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a covered forest
that's covered by the dunes.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
organic material.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:90%
You can date it.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So they carbon-14
dated the wood.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It's only 11,000 years old.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So the dunes only have
been there 11,000 years.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you have a pile
of sand 49 square miles,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:84%
700 feet high, that's been piled
up in less than 12,000 years?

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.447 align:middle line:90%
I was a geology minor in school.

00:21:31.447 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I know a little bit
about the subject.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is absolutely
inconceivable

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that that amount of
sand, even with hurricane

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
force winds every day,
could pile up that much sand

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
in such a short period of time.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So I had a physicist
friend of mine.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
He called me up all
excited one day.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.642 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I figured out
how the dunes got there.

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.208 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, we know the
Sangres are filled with quartz.

00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
There's huge caverns probably
filled with quartz under there,

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, it's the
Ant people that supposedly

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.652 align:middle line:84%
live underneath the ground
that take care of the Indians.

00:22:01.652 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
When the Earth's going
to cleanse itself,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
they go through the sipapu,
the place of emergence.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
One of those entrances is
right there by the sand dunes.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And they go down there.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Ant people
are making more room

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.495 align:middle line:84%
by carving up the quartz,
powdering it up, and throwing

00:22:16.495 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
it out the back door.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
glass is coming from.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest pile of
pure glass on the planet.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It's 98% pure silica.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at any other
sand on beaches and stuff,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:90%
most of it's silica.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the primary
constituent element.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see lightning
between dunes.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
There's supposedly heard
of these web-footed horses

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that have these huge hooves
that have been grown out.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're like
paddles, and they're

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:90%
able to gallop to the sand.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:90%
The pioneers reported them.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's tons of caverns.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, there's a
military satellite system

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
called DUMPSTER.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:10%
I forget what the
acronym stands for.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:10%
But I've heard versions
that it can map 500

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:10%
feet into the Earth's bedrock.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:10%
And I've heard other versions
it can go as much as a half

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:10%
a mile.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't know what
kind of technology

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:10%
it would take to
have that capability,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:10%
but based on the
research that I did,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:10%
it went operational
in the mid '90s.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the first place that they
mapped was the Giza Plateau.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The second place they mapped
was the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And the third place they mapped
was the southern Sangre de

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Cristo Mountains.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of makes me
wonder, maybe there's

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:84%
some element of the military,
maybe government, Department

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
of Defense, somewhere
that knows something

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on
underground in the Rocky

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Mountains.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
information that I've

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
uncovered that would
suggest that there's

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
an ancient antediluvian tunnel
system in the southwest.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the ex-postmaster
of the Los Alamos Lab,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:90%
his son was my guitar player.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And during the summers, he would
work as a mail delivery guy

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
underground in the tunnels
at Los Alamos on a bicycle.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And his grandfather, or
the postmaster's father,

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
was an underground
demolitions expert.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And he helped expand the lab
underground in the late '50s

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:90%
and early '60s.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.537 align:middle line:84%
The military uses the San Luis
Valley as a social petri dish.

00:24:07.537 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
To give you an
example, I'm going down

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Highway 17 pretty late at night,
about 10 o'clock at night.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I see a row of flashing
lights about 300 feet across,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.640 align:middle line:90%
sequence.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I immediately stop, get
my night vision out.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.525 align:middle line:84%
It's three C-130s, cargo
planes, wingtip to wingtip.

00:24:26.525 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And they had
sequenced the lights

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
down the leading edge of
all three planes' wings

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:90%
in perfect synchronization.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I was just close
enough to hear them.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The wind was going
the other way.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
If I had been two or
three miles further away--

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.077 align:middle line:84%
they were really quiet
for C-130s, number one.

00:24:43.077 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I had been any
further distance away,

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I would've seen the
mother ship flying by.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.203 align:middle line:84%
Now what the heck are they using
C-130s, conventional craft,

00:24:51.203 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and putting unconventional
lighting arrays on there?

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
see who sees it.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Do they report it
to the sheriff?

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it reported as a UFO?

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Does that report make
it to the local paper?

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.033 align:middle line:90%
Is there any spin on that?

00:25:03.033 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I've had cases where
people are driving along.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And two about 30-foot
perfect triangles

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
fly right in front of their
car, followed by F-16s.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said these
were not planes.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:90%
They were holes in the sky.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:90%
They were blacker than black.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
holes flying by,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.667 align:middle line:84%
one right after another,
with F-16s hauling ass,

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:90%
right on their tail.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of military
activity that goes on there.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- I don't know.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
That place is just--
it's so bizarre,

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
that were going on.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really going on in
the San Luis Valley may never be

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
fully understood.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Because of its
geographical isolation,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a place where
it's easy to hide.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Possibly both the US military
and off-planet forces

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
are occupying areas
within the large valley.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Like the Bermuda Triangle
and other haunted landscapes,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious
valley only proves

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that nature's way is often
difficult for we humans

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode
we'll look at the control

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
grid of our planet and how we
can break free of the matrix.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:90%
