00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> On November 23, 1966, NASA
released an image taken by NASA

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
satellite Lunar Orbiter 2 of
six very tall towers or spires

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
or cuspids found on the
surface of the moon.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The towers were called the
Blair Cuspids after Orbiter 2

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:90%
scientist William Blair.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
At the time, this
news was so big

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that "The Los Angeles Times"
and "The Washington Post"

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
printed the Lunar Orbiter
image with big headlines.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:90%
"The Post" front page said this.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
"Six mysterious
statuesque shadows

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
photographed on the
moon by Orbiter."

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:10%
"Post" writer Thomas O'Toole
wrote that the image revealed

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:10%
six shadows which were--

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Hailed by scientists as one
of the most unusual features

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:10%
of the moon ever photographed.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Blair believed that
the geometry of the layout

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of the towers was too regular
to be a random act of nature.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
He insisted there was
an intelligent design

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
behind the construction.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Soviet space engineer
Alexander Abramov

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:10%
looked at the Orbiter picture
and reached the same conclusion

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:10%
as Blair, only he
went much further.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Abramov stated publicly
that the towers

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:90%
form an Egyptian triangle.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:90%
He says--

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The distribution of these
lunar objects is similar

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to the plan of the Egyptian
pyramids near Cairo.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The centers of the spheres
in this lunar [? abaca ?]

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
are arranged
precisely the same way

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
as the apices of
the three pyramids.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA scientist Farouk El-Baz
also hinted that he thought

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
the towers were not natural.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:10%
He said that they were
taller than the tallest

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:10%
buildings on Earth,
as calculated

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:10%
by the tremendously
long shadows they

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:10%
cast on the moon's surface.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:10%
He also noted that the towers
were much lighter in color

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:10%
than the surrounding
area and concluded

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:10%
that the towers were constructed
of a different material.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:10%
Almost immediately after the
newspapers printed the story,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:10%
NASA went into a full cover-up.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
They claimed it was a
trick of light and shadow,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and they ignored all further
inquiries into the six towers.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Art Rosenblum of the
Aquarian Research Foundation

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
met with scientists
who work for NASA.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Rosenblum reports--

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> He told me about the time
of photographing the shadows

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:90%
of the obelisks.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:10%
The Boeing aircraft
corporation published the photo

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:10%
in their company newsletter.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
He had not seen it
published since then.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
He also told me that
while working for NASA,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
he found it uncommonly difficult
to get information from them.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
If monuments have been
discovered on the moon,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
one would suppose that that is
about the most important result

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
of the moon probe effort.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Why is this information not
widely publicized by NASA?

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are they not
fully investigated?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Or are they?

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
What other types of
information is being withheld?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that this
tower system was discovered

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
in the Sea of Tranquility may
be the impetus for NASA choosing

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.613 align:middle line:84%
that place to land Apollo 11
less than three years later.

00:03:21.613 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a lot of evidence
that suggests the moon itself

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
might actually be artificial
or a possibly artificially

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:10%
modified natural satellite.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
there are all kinds

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.157 align:middle line:84%
of structures on
the moon itself,

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
which appear to be artificial,
which indicate that at one time

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
it was a base for very
advanced civilization.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
May have been human, may have
been alien, may have been both.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
multiple epochs

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
of inhabitation of the moon.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But the moon's actual
diameter also happens to be

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the number of years in
the age of the zodiac.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:10%
And as Graham Hancock wrote
in "Fingerprints of the Gods"

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:10%
back in '95, you
have 35 cultures

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient
world that encoded

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:10%
this procession of the equinoxes
from 25,000 to 26,000 years

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:10%
into their ancient mythology.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:10%
And 12 ages of the zodiac adds
up to the 25,920 year cycle.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So it would appear that
the moon was designed

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:90%
for a particular purpose.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists have
asked the question,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
what would life on Earth
be like without a moon?

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
The answer to this
question is troubling.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Without a moon, there would
be very little tidal flow.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The rivers in the oceans that
bring hot equatorial water

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to the polar regions and
back would disappear.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, the moon has slowed
our planetary rotation.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we had no moon,
the days would speed up.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The moon also locks the planet
into a 23 and 1/2 degree tilt,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:90%
which gives us our seasons.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Without the moon
locking the Earth,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the planet would begin to
rotate at different angles,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and this would cause the
weather to become very weird.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the polar regions
would move into the hot zones,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and then all of the
ice caps would melt.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Because the gravitational
effects of the moon

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:10%
and creating tides and things
like that is what created life

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And so until we had this moon
in orbit around our planet,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
there couldn't really be
life here as we know it.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In his book, "The Secret
Teachings of All Ages,"

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall tells us about the
rights of the Druid people from

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Ireland.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:90%
He says--

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The Druids also had other
symbolic instruments such

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
as a peculiarly shaped Golden
Sickle with which they cut

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the mistletoe from
the oak and the conan,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or scepter in the
form of a crescent,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
symbolic of the sixth day of
the increasing moon and the Ark

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
of Noah.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
An early initiate of
the Druidic mysteries

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:84%
related that admission to
their midnight ceremonies

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
was gained by a means of a
glass boat called Cwrwg Gwydrin.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
This boat symbolized
the moon, which

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
floating on the
waters of eternity

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
preserved the seeds
of living creatures

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.728 align:middle line:90%
within its boat-like crescent.

00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:10%
>> This ties in very nicely with
the testimony of researchers

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:10%
who claim that the moon might
be a planet-sized Noah's Ark.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the moon
seemed to have maybe

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:10%
arrived here right around
the time of the extinction

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:10%
of the dinosaurs 65
million years ago

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:10%
and that it could be a source
or database of actual DNA,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:10%
where it can then
repopulate an entire planet

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:10%
with different species at
different eras in time.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that a
meteorite or an asteroid

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:90%
killed the dinosaurs?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a deliberate act?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you come back to modern
times to people like William

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Tompkins from this
Naval Intelligence,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
beyond top secret
operation interacting with

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about
the moon being the command

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
center for a reptilian race.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:10%
And again, if you keep
connecting the dots,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:10%
you keep looking--

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:10%
ancient, modern,
ancient, modern--

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:10%
the body of evidence
that you can create,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:10%
that gives you a picture--

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:10%
from the pixels
comes the picture--

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:10%
is absolutely extraordinary
and explains so much

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:10%
about life on Earth.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything I've seen
on the moon is in ruins.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
it's not inhabited.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is is that the
best place you could possibly

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.103 align:middle line:84%
have a base to operate
around the Earth,

00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
if you were working on
the Earth or you wanted

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.295 align:middle line:84%
to move out into the solar
system from the Earth,

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:90%
would be on the moon.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Now I've seen lots of
videos of craft traveling

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to and from the moon that
appear to be authentic to me,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and my guess would be that
the moon is inhabited.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't put any proof on
that, but I can prove to you

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:90%
that it has been inhabited.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So one has happened, then
it follows that the other

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
is distinctly probable.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really amazing is when
you analyze some of the images

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
from the USGS.gov server,
you begin to realize that

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
there's something underneath
the surface of the moon.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
A very esteemed anomaly
hunter and image analyst

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
named Chris Moroney
of Mars Anomalies

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
has great footage
of the analysis

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.072 align:middle line:90%
of this subsurface structure.

00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at it,
you see all of a sudden

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that the ground-penetrating
radar now

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
is showing many, many layers
beneath the moon's surface

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.178 align:middle line:84%
going down what appears to
be maybe thousands of feet.

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And what that tells us is
that even with the naked eye,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:84%
you can see this imagery
on a US government server,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
showing us that
something definitely

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:90%
is going on inside the moon.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:90%
What could it be?

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we
have a base from Earth

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
on the moon right now maybe
mining for resources that we've

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
not been told about?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
Is it some type of
top secret project?

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Could it be a progenitor
race that has basically

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:90%
inhabited the moon?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
According to some of
the ancient tablets,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
there was a situation where
there was a war on Earth

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and the actual
faction that started

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that war, which was a
relative of the other race,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
was then banished to
go live on the moon.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
bloodline now on the moon,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
now inhabiting the
inside of the moon?

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be some
type of a really,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
super ancient, ancient race
that had basically formulated

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
this moon as some type of
a grand Noah's Ark in case

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.455 align:middle line:84%
anything ever
happened to the Earth,

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
that they can be able
to repopulate or reseed

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:90%
this planet.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.458 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, these images
are very, very intriguing.

believe that the Earth did not

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
always have a moon, some think
it was moved here in more

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:90%
recent times.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a book by
Immanuel Velikovsky which talks

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
about the moon being an
object which is only a part

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
of our recent history.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:10%
He has quoted a number
of ancient historians,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Herodotus amongst
them and others,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:10%
that referred to
pre-lunar cultures.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
These were peoples who described
the times before the moon,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
where they still had the
memories of the night sky

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
not having a moon at all.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
the moon arrived.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And so dating that,
I would say it's

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
anywhere within the
last 50,000 years

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
in terms of when oral traditions
began and were eventually

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
recorded and
transcribed in some way.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So up to 55,000,
60,000 years ago,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that's when
the moon arrived

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and that the moon arrived
as an artificial body

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
with refugees from a wider
cataclysm that had occurred

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the solar system.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:10%
I think that the whole exploded
planet hypothesis of Thomas Van

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:10%
Flandern, I think that's
very accurate in terms

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:10%
of showing how the asteroid belt
was very likely a planet at one

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:10%
point in its history and
the destruction of a planet

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:10%
would require some
artificial process.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It would require a war.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And a war would by necessity
involve advanced civilizations

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
with the technology that
could blow up a planet.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that to me suggests
that it's very feasible

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that the moon was at
some point a satellite

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:90%
of this exploded planet.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly, in
Thomas Van Flandern's paper,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:10%
"The Exploded
Planet Hypothesis,"

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:10%
he hypothesizes
that Mars was also

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:10%
one of the moons of this planet
and that the conflict could

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:10%
have involved Mars at a time
when it was very green, very

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:10%
fertile in a war with the
inhabitants of this exploding

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:10%
planet-- a super Earth, really.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So this super Earth
was exploded or had

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
exploded because probably
some kind of technology

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that taps the planet's core
was used that went awry.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And so Mars is blown off course,
and the moon starts to drift

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and eventually finds
its way to Earth.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the Earth
has the sufficient size

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to capture the moon,
given its size.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our gravity
isn't strong enough.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So the moon was basically
artificially directed

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
into the orbit around
the Earth, and I

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
think it is an
artificial body that

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
arrived carrying
a lot of refugees

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:90%
from this ancient cataclysm.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
began to develop

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
a global civilization,
which later on became

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.394 align:middle line:90%
known as Atlantis.

>> We are being assimilated.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:10%
It's a process, step
by step by step.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:10%
And to do it, our perception
has to be hijacked

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:10%
and our sense of self
has to be hijacked.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm coming from is that
we are a point of attention.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
When I say "we," I mean at the
deepest level of perception

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of being, beyond
all the garments

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we call bodies and even
the electromagnetic fields,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
we are a state of
awareness, nothing else.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And all these vehicles that
awareness experiences through

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
are simply means of experience.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And what has happened--

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is described
in many ancient texts--

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
is that that state of
awareness, that infinite self,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that which all of us
are an expression of,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
we're all points of attention
within the one infinite

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
awareness, has been
perceptually enslaved

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
in a state of perception
that I call phantom self.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
That is the perception
that who we are

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is our name, our race, our
religion, our life story,

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
our background, our
job, our income bracket,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and that's who we are.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Now this perceptional delusion
of mistaking an experience

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
for infinite self or true self
means that you, first of all,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
perceptually squeeze the
sense of the possible.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
You present people that fall
for that with a sense of "little

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
me, I've got no power,"
and a sense of "I can't."

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take most people
in their perceptions of self

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and their perceptions of
reality, they'll say, "Well,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:90%
what can I do?

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we can do."

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:10%
And if you are then persuaded
that you have no power,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:10%
then you give the
power you really

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:10%
have but don't know about
to authority over you.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And that perception
of authority has power

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and we don't then creates
another level of the control

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
system, and we are
being manipulated.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a much bigger story.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
We are being manipulated
to a point where

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we are attached technologically
to artificial intelligence

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that's been
well documented is the fact

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of the moon on
human consciousness.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
When we have a full
moon, it always

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
seems that people
on the Earth tend

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a lot more aggressive.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back
even to ancient times.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to
analyze a full moon,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that
police activity increase

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:90%
because somehow crime increases.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You also begin to see
that at hospitals, there's

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:84%
a lot more activity going
on in the birthing centers

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and in the amount of
people coming in injured.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
This is always happening
under full moons.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's even in cases
where in the police station,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
they've actually had
to ramp up or staff up

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
on the nights of
full moons to be

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
able to handle the
extra workload that's

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They almost anticipate
that during a full moon,

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be some
extra activity going on.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Why is a full moon causing
or having this effect

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:90%
on human consciousness?

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
When you analyze a full moon
and you analyze the distance

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
from the moon to the
Earth, it does vary

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:90%
in a very elliptical shape.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And when the moon becomes
closer to the Earth,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:84%
then you have a much
stronger gravitational field.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And that field definitely
interacts there roughly

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:90%
with human consciousness.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.808 align:middle line:84%
It's already been proven in
professors and laboratories

00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
that when you actually

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
add a magnetism or
electromagnetic fields

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
to a human brain,
you can actually

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
get a different
train of thought,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.318 align:middle line:84%
you can have people
thinking in different ways,

00:16:17.318 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
you can even have people
hallucinating, OK?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.367 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
we've done in laboratories

00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So we know that electromagnetism
and gravity will

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
have a direct effect
on human consciousness,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and this could be one of the
reasons why during a full moon,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
we see this instance
of human psychology

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.342 align:middle line:84%
dramatically changing
all over the planet.

00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
As an example, we have
the study of [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:10%
by Russian scientist
[? Bolakrav ?],, who

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:10%
takes fish ages to show that
eggs that are older and are

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:10%
closer to becoming newborn fish
will actually suck the life

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:10%
force out of the younger eggs.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
If you keep them close by
and put a piece of glass

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in the way, which
blocks the UV light,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
the little eggs do
not wither and die.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So UV light seems to
be the key, but what

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:84%
carries this UV light
is the torsion field.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a light pipe that
is something in gravity.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So that may be where we get the
weirdness happening in people

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
during a full moon and
maybe even where we

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
get the word "lunatic"
coming from "lunar."

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.047 align:middle line:84%
So the word "lunatic" may be
derived from the word "lunar."

00:17:13.047 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
And when you really look
into the ancient tablets

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
or specifically the
Enuma Elish, the Seven

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Tablets of the Creation, which
go back thousands of years,

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.131 align:middle line:84%
there's an actual creation story
about the entire solar system.

00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
And in this story,
there's a planet

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
named Tiamat which orbits just
outside where now Mars is.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Tiamat was a super Earth about
four to six times the size

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:90%
of Earth itself, and it had--

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
at least we know of-- two moons.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
One was a habitable
moon we now call Mars,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and the other one was
our moon, which we now

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:90%
have here orbiting the Earth.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
However, during an
ancient collision,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
it seems that gravitationally
our solar system,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
according to these tablets,
captured a brown dwarf star

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
that had planets orbiting it.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:84%
One of those planets collided
with this Tiamat planet, which

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
was a water-bearing
organic world,

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and caused it to break
into gigantic chunks.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.972 align:middle line:84%
One big chunk swung away
and became the Earth.

00:18:04.972 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:90%
So it coalesced to the Earth.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:10%
The other chunks broke up
and became the asteroid belt,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:10%
also known in ancient texts
as the Hammered Bracelet.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:10%
Now when the Earth
itself re-coalesced,

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:10%
it gravitationally took
something along with it.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It tugged along with it
gravitationally the moon--

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the moon that used to be a
moon of this Tiamat planet

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
according to these
ancient tablets.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Also because Mars
was a habitable moon,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
it got slung into this
very weird elliptical orbit

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
around our sun, which
then can be backtracked

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to where it originally was when
the collision first happened.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.213 align:middle line:84%
And it also explains
why one side of Mars

00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is completely charred
and the other side

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.370 align:middle line:90%
is completely smooth.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The side this charred
is from the impact side,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and the side that's
smooth obviously

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is the side facing away
from the initial explosion.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is a real
incredible story,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
but it does show
the power of gravity

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and how between our
Earth and the chunk

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that we were re-coalescing
with a specific orbit

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
around our sun, gravitationally
pulling the moon along with us,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and now having another
planet out there named

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Mars getting its own
orbit around the sun all

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
based on gravity.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Through the Freedom
of Information Act,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
we were able to get the black
box audio from the Apollo 11.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the Apollo
11 astronauts were actually

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
going across the moon or kind
of flying across the moon,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
looking for their landing site.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:84%
During that phase,
one of the astronauts

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.318 align:middle line:84%
actually says,
"Look at the conical

00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
craters down there,"
in other words eluding

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to a dome structure.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Look at them."

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And then Neil says, "I
bet the people down there

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
never get out."

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting
statement to make,

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you're
being recorded,

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.532 align:middle line:84%
and even the fact that
the printout was made

00:19:37.532 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of the redacted
statements and they

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
left that part available
to the general population.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's available to anybody.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, the
noted Western mystic Gurdjieff

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.955 align:middle line:10%
did say that the
moon was a soul trap

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:10%
and you should avoid going
near it in your afterlife

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:10%
because you could be drawn
into some type of reincarnation

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We also see this in
the work of Philip K.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:10%
Dick when he wrote
the book "VALIS,"

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:10%
where it appears that VALIS
means Vast, Acting, Living

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:10%
Information System and that
VALIS actually connected

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.327 align:middle line:10%
to the moon and this is
what was inside the moon.

00:20:08.327 --> 00:20:11.666 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Through this exploration
of our lunar cousin,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
it can be revealed that the moon
is one of the strangest objects

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that humans have
examined in their quest

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:90%
to conquer outer space.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It appears to have been placed
in orbit around the Earth

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:90%
so that life could thrive here.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It might be hollow, and it
could even be Noah's Ark.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
While no human has
supposedly gone

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to the moon for
almost 45 years, it's

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
heartening to realize
that several countries are

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
ramping up programs to
explore the moon again.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Possibly, these
programs will answer

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
some of the questions that
linger concerning our moon.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we'll continue

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
our exploration of
the solar system

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
as we visit the planet Mars.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
