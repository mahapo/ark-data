>> Myths of insect-like beings
helping humanity during times

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of cataclysms can be found
throughout the ancient world.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Often referred to as mantis
or mantids, insectoids or even

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Ant People.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Their influence can
still be felt today.

beings who

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a
vested interest in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:90%
our evolutionary development.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, who
are these insectoids

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:90%
that work in the shadows.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And what is their influence
upon humanity and our future?

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We see representations
of insectoids throughout

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Earth's history, particularly
with the Egyptian culture.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There was other depictions
of insectoid beings

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
in some of the Mayan cultures,
with some of the cultures

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:90%
that we see out of Africa.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think they were at
times teachers to humanity.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's why these beings
are currently being depicted

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:10%
throughout Earth's history.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
There was depictions
of insectoid beings

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
even within the Native
American cultures, particularly

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
the ant people.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:10%
>> We know about the ant people
helping the Native American

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:10%
people from the oral stories of
the Zuni and the Hopi people,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:10%
as well as from the petroglyphic
carvings that we find

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10%
in Northern Arizona showing
us depictions of these

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.345 align:middle line:10%
insectoid-looking people
that are the Ant People.

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
ago, Earth was

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
facing a very major
cataclysm that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
was threatening to
destroy all of life

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the planet.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
As this cataclysm
was getting underway,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the ant people came out from
under the surface of the Earth

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and ushered humanity into
these underground caverns,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and cared for humanity while
the surface of the Earth

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%
was just being devastated.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And there, they stayed
for generations.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:10%
After the cataclysm
had passed, humanity

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:10%
was led back up to the
surface, and these ant people

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:10%
were instrumental in
helping the humans learn

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:10%
how to replant
foods, how to go back

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:10%
into the agricultural
communities

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:10%
so that they could
survive very well

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of the planet.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:10%
>> The petroglyphs on the walls
where Ant People have been

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:10%
described in the South, in
Mexico, and various areas,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:10%
those people referred
to, I believe,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:10%
were the small greys or the
medium-sized greys because they

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:10%
had the long spindly arms,
the big heads, and so forth.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they got the
idea that the only thing

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
they could link them to or
talk about in a description

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that they knew was the ants.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
There is also the
possibility that some

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of those that are
termed Ant People

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
could be from inner Earth.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:10%
There is definitely a group
of different alien species

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:10%
on an inner Earth.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
They kind of look
like Ant People,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
like live in and out where
the poles have openings.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's the possibility
of both of those

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
being classified as Ant People.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> According to one nature
photographer and art historian,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
there is a cliff sculpture in
Colorado that commemorates when

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
the Ant People rescued Native
Americans from two separate

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
cataclysms thousands
of years ago.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
While historical lore
describe ant or mantis-looking

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
beings inhabiting
inner Earth, what

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
do we know about their
Galactic origins?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do these
mantis beings come from?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%
That's still kind of a mystery.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
they've got a home world

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
or if they're scattered
throughout the cosmos

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and various home worlds.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
There are reports
that they do have

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
some bases here in our solar
system, little planetoids

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
or even on Mars,
different locations.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
>> We have only interacted
with the insectoids in a few

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:10%
locations on ships and
on the surface of Mars.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You can assume that
they have places they

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
come from that are all over.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It eventually becomes
difficult for us

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:90%
to say they come from a planet.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:10%
The ones that are
negatively oriented

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:10%
are almost entirely
seen on ships.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really see them
running around some other place

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
having societies.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't see anything like that.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
We see them doing jobs on ships.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
free, the good ones,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
we see on the surface of
some planets, such as Mars.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The mantis beings are a
physicality type that is seen

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
in variations of forms
throughout our universe

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and our galaxy.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is they actually

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
originated from a
different universe,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
but have settled
here in our universe.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:10%
They were the
beings that resided

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:10%
in the star system of Antares.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:10%
They were considered to be the
gatekeepers of the Antarian

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:10%
stargate.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a reason why they
had to oversee this stargate

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
because souls were allowed to
pass through from Andromeda

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, but they
were not allowed

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:90%
to leave the Milky Way galaxy.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
made that decision

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
to become part of the
Milky Way experience,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
you had to make a commitment
to be here for a while.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So what's known from
contactees is that they come

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:10%
from Orion, Andromeda, and
way far out into the galaxies

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:10%
and beyond into
realms and worlds.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:10%
They are a matriarchal society,
where the females rule,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:10%
but everyone is still equal.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
They are so advanced in
their consciousness moving up

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions that they
even have these high temples

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
of learning and
spiral learning where

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
they can invite an individual
or a planetary consciousness

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that's ready to move into
their next realm to ascend.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Mantis beings are referred
to as insectoids by humans.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:10%
But that is simply
a classification

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:10%
we've created, limited by our
current knowledge of Earth

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:10%
species.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
According to
eyewitness accounts,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
mantis beings take on a
wide range of appearances.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most striking
aspect of the mantis alien

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
is its physical kinship
with the praying mantis,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the carnivorous and bipedal
insect of its namesake.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of what we got about
mantis beings comes to us from

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
eyewitness reports, people
who've seen them or various

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
other situations that
they've come across these

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:90%
insectoid-looking beings.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
They all describe the
same kind of thing

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that they've got these elongated
arms, extended skinny torsos,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
that they have some sort
of a shiny exoskeleton.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And a triangular
shaped head sometimes

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.493 align:middle line:84%
with some proboscis poking out
from their heads, which really

00:08:21.493 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
gives us the
impression that these

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:90%
look a lot like praying mantis.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these reports
tell us that they have a cloak

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
around them, like either a dark
grey cloak or a blue cloak.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But they definitely have this
elongated insectoid appearance

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of the descriptions
I've seen, it has a proboscis,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:10%
which is like what an insect
has is this sort of tongue

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:10%
and projection of
its mouth cavity.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to fit
the perfect description

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of what a praying
mantis should be,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
even down to a point where
its hands are actually bent

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and in that position.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The mantis beings
have three pronged hands.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of like three
prongs that go down like this.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Their feet have sort of
a suction cup feeling.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So when they walk, they
can have a stability.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
On their crafts, it is
said that everything is run

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
telepathically through them.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Insectoids as a whole mostly
follow the mantis appearance ,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:90%
but there's varying sizes.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
There are some
that are very, very

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
large, like the
Antarian insectoids were

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:90%
very large beings.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:90%
They were 15 to 20 feet tall.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
There are others that were
the technicians that work with

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:90%
the grey aliens.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of the
insectoids that we

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
saw in Orion that were more
closer to human height.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
just a variation where

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:10%
depending on which star
systems or which locations

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:10%
that they came from, it was just
a natural evolution of height.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:10%
There are different types
of insectoid beings.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:10%
I would say the mantis is
the most prominent one.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But there is also beetle
like-looking beings.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
There's just variations
of insectoid beings,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.275 align:middle line:84%
just like there are variations
of insects on planet Earth.

00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Regarding different
alien ET races,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:10%
praying mantises are placed
in quataloids category within

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:10%
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:90%
They are genetically engineered.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And one particular type
looks like a praying mantis.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
The larger praying mantis
is 5 or 6 foot tall.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And the second type
is more humanoid.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Now when we say
humanoid, we're not

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:90%
talking about human-looking.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Thicker skin, a more
structured-looking head.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:10%
>> There's two basic types--

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:10%
the hostile and the friendly.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:10%
The hostile are
essentially a slave race

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:10%
to another group of
extraterrestrials

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:10%
called the reptilians.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the hostile groups,
the reptilians are at the top.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And all groups below
that, they manipulate

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
in some way direct or indirect,
and they're essentially

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
all slaves of that
higher reptilian source.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
The good mantis
beings are not slaves.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They are not controlled
by the reptilians.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
independent orientation.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite their daunting
outer appearance,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
many researchers report that
encounters with mantis beings

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
have been for the
most part positive.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, they're
totally sentient.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody
else in the galaxy,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
their communicative capabilities
are almost entirely telepathic.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So they don't use
a mouth like we

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:84%
use to vibrate air to make
sounds that produce things.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you get a
good one and they're

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
interested in
communicating with you

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're physically there,
they often put like pincers up

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
against her head, and they
bring themselves close

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and they go into
your head that way.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they can go through
your head like a Rolodex.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.993 align:middle line:84%
And often when they
communicate with you,

00:12:28.993 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to sort
out what kind of person

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you are to have a
nice communication.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a hostile to them,
you may not fare too well.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you're friendly to them,
they'll have a conversation.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Mantis beings are the
most enigmatic beings of all

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I have talked with
many researchers

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
just to see if we
could find anybody that

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:90%
has had experiences with them.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Usually somebody would have
at least one experience

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
with a mantis being,
which was always positive.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the mantis are
very empathic, they are loving,

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
they are caring.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to be for the
most part what is experienced.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
idea that the mantis

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
are confrontational or
negative or anything.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it
stems from the fact

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:90%
that they look so scary.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:90%
They look so daunting.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And we immediately imply, Oh
my God, if you look like that,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be mean.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
necessarily the case.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the reports come
back that these beings have

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
a good sense of humor, that
there is a lighter disposition

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:90%
They're a bit friendlier.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of fun to
be around despite initially

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
being off put by their
scary appearance.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:10%
One of the stories we
have about interaction

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:10%
comes to us from Pete
Peterson when he was working

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:10%
in some of the secret programs.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He talked about interacting
with mantis type beings in some

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
of the underground military
bases and in the programs

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:90%
that he works with.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the stories he
tells is when they were all

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
sitting around the eating
table at the mess hall,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and the mantis
beings were making

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
fun of the way humans were
eating, because to them the way

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
we eat is a little disgusting
and a little bit weird.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But he said that they were
cracking jokes all the time,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.447 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
having just a lot of fun.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They were just a joy to
be around the entire time.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, because I felt secure
with the people I was with,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%
then I felt secure.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.717 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't a fright.

00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:35.133 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think the
thing was going

00:14:35.133 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:90%
to turn around and eat me.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:90%
But I had wonderment.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was an insect
that was all structured--

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:84%
two feet, two legs, two
arms, two hands, two eyes,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and a nose, then a mouth,
mandible, chin and ears.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have long antennas, but
it had little balls on stubs.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that the
skin scraped together

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and it sounded like
fingernail files.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it may have
come from a praying mantis.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:10%
Then spoke like it had
horny plates and things

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:10%
like that it moved
around to make

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.417 align:middle line:10%
the dissonances and the
resonances, stuff like that.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It didn't sound like it was
coming through a soft tissue

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:90%
mouth.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It spoke English.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.323 align:middle line:84%
And some speak and some just
talk to you in your head.

00:15:27.323 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like you know
what they're thinking

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.448 align:middle line:84%
and they know what
you're thinking.

00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1970s, the
United States Air Force had

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:10%
an encounter with a craft
piloted by a mantis-like being

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:10%
that was taken into custody.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
According to retired
Air Force Office

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations
agent Richard Doty,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
classified documents that he was
privy to described this event.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The quataloid craft
was flying in Nevada.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
This is in the early '70s.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It crashed because it was
shot at by an Air Force jet.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
An F-4 jet flying out of Nellis
Air Force base encountered it.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Jet didn't have a
weapons system on.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Another jet was launched
from Nellis Air Force base,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
chased this craft.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
There was hostile acts presented
against the Air Force aircraft.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And Air Force jet fired
a sidewinder missile.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.905 align:middle line:90%
It struck it, and it crashed.

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
There were quataloids
in the craft.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of them died,
two of them were alive.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:10%
When the military personnel
recovered the wreckage,

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:10%
these two quataloids already had
some kind of environmental suit

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:10%
on them.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they were taken
out of the craft,

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
they were detained
by military police,

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and they were taken to
this containment area.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we obviously
did a lot of analysis

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
on the dead one
determining its structure--

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
entirely different
anatomy-wise, biologically-wise.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They're all different
than any of the Ebens.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But their brain was
enormously more advanced

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:90%
than anything we'd ever seen.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It had lobes and other
things that we just

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
couldn't understand.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything was connected.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
They took apart
the nerve fibers.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:90%
We called them nerves.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
controlled by the brain.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
central nervous system.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
backbone, so to speak.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
They had a bony structure,
something different than ours.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes were
extremely more advanced.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They had almost three
sets of eyeballs.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
could feed themselves.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
They had little
pouches on their side,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and they produced a
ball of something.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.862 align:middle line:84%
And they could eat it and
keep themselves sustained.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
The craft that was shot down
over Nevada was 100 foot.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It was not exactly saucer-shaped
but pretty close to it.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It was very tall,
probably 30 or 40 feet.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The interior craft was
extremely complicated.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.073 align:middle line:84%
They controlled
everything by their hands.

00:18:29.073 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
else that they'd

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
placed over their head, as
if maybe their brain was also

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.613 align:middle line:90%
controlling something.

00:18:37.613 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that was really unique

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:90%
about this craft--

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
this blue fluid circulated all
over the craft, tubular lines.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Tubettes, I think
they called them.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And it all centered in
the bottom of the craft

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:90%
where the propulsion system was.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So when the propulsion
system was activated,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
this bluish fluid
would circulate

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:84%
all over the interior
walls of the craft.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that we
determined whether it was maybe

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:90%
something to do with cooling.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it assisted them
in stabilizing the craft.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

encounters with mantis-like

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to have had direct contact with
the mantis species when taken

aboard their spacecrafts.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
common revelations

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
about the mantis
beings is that they

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
appear to be working closely
with the extraterrestrials

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
known as the greys.

>> The reports of how people
would have interacted with

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:84%
the mantis beings comes
through these people onboard

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
a spacecraft with grey
aliens, short grey aliens,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
seeming to do a bulk of the work
where the mantis-type beings

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
are the superiors, the bosses,
giving instructions and guiding

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.388 align:middle line:84%
the whole situation
that's going on.

00:20:07.388 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the people when
they're in this scenario,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.638 align:middle line:84%
they're a little bit
afraid, a little concerned

00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
for their own safety
and what's going on.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Then when the mantis bring
themselves to the forefront

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're interacting,
they give a sense of calm.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They convey a sense
of peacefulness,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
letting them know
that you're OK.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.425 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you.

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be all right.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the mantis will
employ the short greys,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to do that kind of
grunt work, to do

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
some of that base-level
foundation work that leaves

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
them free and open to use their
minds to connect at a higher

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.748 align:middle line:84%
level, do the
higher-level working.

00:20:40.748 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing throughout
the cosmos is that there are

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
beings that operate on the fifth
or sixth density or even higher

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and that they cannot work on
the third density where most

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:90%
of humanity is.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So they need to work with
an intermediary species

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
like the short greys
who can communicate

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to the fifth- and
sixth-density beings

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but yet operate in the
third density where we are.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So that may be one of the
biggest reasons why the mantis

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:90%
are using the short greys--

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
because their minds are too high
of a level to directly interact

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:90%
with what needs to be done.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:90%

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The job is a
breeding process,

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
a genetic engineering
breeding process.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Their ultimate goal is to have a
population of extraterrestrials

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that we would call Essassani,
which are half grey and half

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So those mantis
beings, their job

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is to get that group
of people ready.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, that group
of people was not

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
designed to live someplace else.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
They're designed to
blend into human society.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So the control that's
necessary is really oriented

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
around getting
the people who are

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
being brought into the ships
through a physical examination.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a large
component of behavioral stuff.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So once you have the Essassani,
half-grey half-human beings

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:84%
there, they don't know
how to survive on Earth.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't know anything.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Mantis beings, I think
they have their own agenda.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I kind of see them
more as neutral beings

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
where they have a
scientific interest in us.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:90%

Many experiencers
claim that the mantis

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:84%
seem to possess the
uncanny ability to put them

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
at ease, offering telepathic
communication to eliminate

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:90%
the fear of an encounter.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the complexity
of these communications

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is the challenge to those
having a contact experience.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I think possibly they're
there to physically invade

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
your mind.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're
specialists in that.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest
that they actually

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.917 align:middle line:90%
are there for a purpose.

00:23:23.917 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
They're not just there
as an overseer, which

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.458 align:middle line:84%
is very hard to
understand because people

00:23:27.458 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
can't access that information
or use it productively.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
common experience

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
where you get a download
into your brain,

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
but then you're not going to
use it for any specific things.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't see humans.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
They see Earth thinking.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:10%
And that's the main concept
that we have to change.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:10%
They see a whole planet
thinking something,

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:10%
trying to figure out
who the planet is.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Who am I is asking the planet.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
so many cultures,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
so many countries
fighting each other.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like we are a
schizophrenic teenager right now

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
for the galaxy, basically,
with too much hormones.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So they are just giving us
space to figure out who we are,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
what do we want to
be when we grow up.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So they are just guiding us,
not trying to control us.

humanity?

>> What we know about the
agenda of contact with mantis

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:84%

bit disconnected.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have, necessarily,
a big strong agreement.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But there does seem to be some
sort of genetic experiment

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.055 align:middle line:90%
thing going on.

00:24:57.055 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The only collective
information that we

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
seem to have from the
eyewitnesses and the people who

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
have worked with mantis as
to what their mission is

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
is to help humanity reach
a higher state of being.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be at
the cellular level,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
the genetic level,
not necessarily so

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:90%
much at the spiritual level.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians would be more
of a spiritual-level type

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
But it seems the
mantis are helping us

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
at the cellular level.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
The mantis might be interacting
with other species who

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
have had a genetic influence on
humanity through the Galactic

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Federation, because
our reports of people

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:84%
who have worked with
the Galactic Federation

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and had direct
interactions with it

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
have talked about all of
the genetic experiments

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:90%
that other beings work with.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They get that permission
to work with humanity

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and do the work that
they're doing here.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So the interactions of
the mantis, I believe,

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
will be as a concerted effort
through the Galactic Federation

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and working with other
civilizations that

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:90%
are a part of the Federation.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The mantis mentality
regarding humanity--

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
at this point in time, I
would say one of benevolence.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:84%
If it fits their
agenda, which is, so far

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:84%
as we know, to learn, to
understand, to experience--

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:84%
unlike their appearance,
a rose always

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
has thorns, so there may be some
negativity in some instance.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the
interaction with mantis

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:90%
has been one of quiet and peace.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So ultimately,
don't fear the mantis.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They might look
a little strange.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.793 align:middle line:84%
They might seem a
little bit weird.

00:26:37.793 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
They might be a
little off-putting

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:90%
the moment that you see them.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But we can embrace
that diversity.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:90%
We can embrace that uniqueness.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they are ultimately
here for our own benefit,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:90%
for our own good.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we can be open to the
benevolence that they have

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and the kindness
that they have, we

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:84%
can have a shared
mutual experience that

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:90%
is just beneficial for all.

>> For a civilization
such as ours,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
seemingly separated from the
universe without contact with

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
advanced intelligences
outside of our own,

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to imagine how
consciousness and life have

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.300 align:middle line:90%
evolved.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
For the majority
of humankind, it's

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
difficult to accept that highly
evolved civilizations exist

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that have an appearance that
remind us of an insect species

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But whether insectoid
beings had a hand

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in guiding humankind
thousands of years ago

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or are currently
influencing us genetically

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
toward a new phase of our
evolution remains to be seen.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps when humanity is
ready to take that next step

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
in conscious evolution,
will this illusive race

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of insectoids finally
step out of the shadows

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and shine more light on
our mutual connection?

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:90%
