00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and nobody seems to be
talking about that potential

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of unleashing the power of
artificial intelligence.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Take a look around your
life, your daily life.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You go into a coffee shop,
you go to the dry cleaner,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
you see a policeman,
you see a taxi driver.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Any and all of
those jobs will be

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
eliminated from a
human perspective

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and replaced by artificially
intelligent robots

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:90%
within 10 years.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about the
singularity eliminating jobs,

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
almost any job that

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
involves any kind of routine.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Doctors, lawyers, eliminated,
replaced by AI robots.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:10%
Menial jobs, however,
street sweepers

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:10%
and construction workers,
this is the type of job

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:10%
that is very difficult
for machines to do.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:10%
Anything that we can
do with our human hands

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and involves
movement in our feet

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:10%
are jobs that will
ultimately be secure.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Thinking jobs,
however, are going

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
to be eliminated
on a human basis

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and will be replaced
by machines.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the advantages of
achieving the singularity

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it unites
human intelligence

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
with machine intelligence
to solve human problems.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Problems with the environment,
problems with biology,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
problems in medicine.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:10%
If we can solve
these problems, we're

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:10%
talking about miraculous
cures for diseases.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
a new way of living.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:10%
But the cost is unparalleled
and beyond our comprehension.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence can
have a revolutionary impact

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
on our politics, on
medicine, on our environment,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
on biology, because
of its ability

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to access massive amounts of
data and perceive patterns

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that would take perhaps a human
years to be able to perceive.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
advantages is being

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
able to apply it in medical
diagnosis, for example.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:10%
It can more accurately
diagnose some diseases

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:10%
than a medical doctor can,
or certainly a med student.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:10%
So that's one area where it
could have a dramatic impact.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:10%
So where does that
leave the human element?

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, if a doctor is
replaced by a robot,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:10%
then maybe a doctor
needs to become a healer

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:10%
because a machine
doesn't have empathy

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:10%
and a machine can't
offer sympathy

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:10%
to a human being on a
human-to-human level.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:10%
So what this will open up
is perhaps a blossoming

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:10%
of our true humanity.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Many of us in menial
jobs, doctors, lawyers,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
not to be insulting, but
they are fairly robotic.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.320 align:middle line:84%
They make a diagnosis and here's
the prescription for the cure.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
A machine can do that
better than a human.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
An artificially intelligent
computer, we now know,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
is a better doctor
than a human doctor.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But a human who is a
doctor and a healer

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
offers something that a machine
will never be able to offer.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think artificial
intelligence,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:84%
the whole AI paradigm,
is a very scary prospect.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
As you know, with
Moore's Law it states

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that processing technology
will advance every 18 months.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:10%
It will double in
speed our ability

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to process using
integrated circuitry.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:10%
We are now at a point where
both AMD and Intel Corporation

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:10%
are releasing 9-core processors
with incredible processing

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:10%
speed, unthinkable back in the
1960s, '70s, and '80s, even

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:10%
in the '90s.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we're on the verge of doing
something that is unheard of.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
We are able to construct
arrays of servers

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and put together programs that
are filled with algorithms

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and subroutines
and functions that

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:84%
allow these servers to
create a consciousness

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and become sentient and
make their own decisions.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what Leonid was about.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Leonid was a defensive system,
an autonomous defensive system,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
with some human
components attached to it,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's meant to detect
inbound ET traffic.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
This was an autonomous
AI-driven system

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
that could make
its own decisions

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
if the human component
was not available.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what scares the
hell out of everybody.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Now they're talking about making
AI for policing the populace,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
AI to help advance
various academic sectors.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I just think, if
you see too much

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of a proliferation of
artificial intelligence,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
you are going to see elimination
of the human component which

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
will allow an AI
system to take over.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that I,
as an engineer with a software

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
background, think I could
ever push as a step forward.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I see it as something
detrimental to humanity.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more, artificially
intelligent machines are making

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
decisions for and about humans.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And here's where the
harm can potentially

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
come in, because
artificial intelligence is

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
becoming a black box.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It's gone on to writing
its own algorithms

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that humans do not understand.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how these
artificially intelligent

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:10%
machines are coming
to the conclusions

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:10%
that they're coming
to, and that puts us

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:10%
in a very precarious position.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
European Union, there's

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:84%
already legislation in place
to say that individuals

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
have the right to demand
that an artificially

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:84%
intelligent computer explain
its solution or its conclusion

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%
to a human.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very,
very dark aspect

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
of artificial
intelligence where we

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
have computers that we do
not any longer understand

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
how they work making
decisions for humans.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We have never created a machine
that we don't understand

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.472 align:middle line:84%
how it works, but
yet that's what

00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
we're doing with
artificial intelligence,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and now it's beginning
to accelerate.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is the danger
of the singularity, where

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:10%
these machines take
on human intelligence

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and vastly expand
on that intelligence

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:10%
and supersede what
humans are able to do

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:10%
and then potentially are
able to outwit humans.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It is when you consider
you have billionaires around

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
the globe funding
independent efforts,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
both in academic settings
and in the private sector.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to stop.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to stop.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the great fears for
experts is that AI will be

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:10%
weaponized and then used to
create fantastic and deadly

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:10%
weapons of an
unimaginable nature.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> A little talked about aspect
of artificial intelligence is

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the military's interest in deep
application of this technology.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And if the military
is using it, there's

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
a teenager somewhere in the
world that is also developing

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:90%
it for their own personal use.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And if this is a
nefarious individual,

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that
one single person

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
with this advanced artificial
intelligence technology

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
could bring down the
entire United States

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
military establishment.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence is,
I call it cowboy technology

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
because these guys
are just running

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
wild with little public
oversight and very little

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
government oversight.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason why is
because much of this technology

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the
darkest aspects

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
of our military intelligence
sectors and technology

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
DARPA is literally feeding
many of these companies

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:90%
the technologies and the ideas.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Siri is a very good
example of that.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It was originally developed by
the Defense Advanced Research

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Projects Agency.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:10%
[DEVICE BEEPS]

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:10%
>> What are you?

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just a humble
virtual assistant.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And now it's a
consumer application.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what other
military applications

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
are in development now at
these companies that will soon

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
become consumer applications,
and how intrusive

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
is that technology going
to be in our lives?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And how rapidly are
we literally turning

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
over control of
our civilisations

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
to machines we don't
know anything about?

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm very concerned
about the militarization

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of the human spirit
through Silicon Valley.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
The reason I say this is because
a lot of the technology that

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is being fed through
Silicon Valley

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
comes from the United
States military,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.357 align:middle line:90%
and it's about control.

00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It's about controlling
the population.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about controlling
our human capabilities.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a conspiracy,
if you want to call it that,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
or a directed effort to suppress
the spiritual capabilities

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:10%
For centuries,
the powers that be

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:10%
have not wanted us to
access this deep reservoir

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:10%
of capabilities that we have.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And through Silicon Valley
now that suppression

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
is becoming even greater.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have, for
example, a brain implant.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you buy into
the smart dust concept

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and you allow them to sprinkle
these nanotechnology computers

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:90%
into your brain.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
They have the capability
of keeping you

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
at a very narrow
range of frequency

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:90%
wherever they want you to be.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.933 align:middle line:10%
And if you start to wander
outside of that frequency,

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:10%
they're going to have a
real problem with you,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.392 align:middle line:10%
and they're going
to try to bring you

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:10%
right back into that prison
planet kind of modality.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I mean
by the militarization

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of the human spirit,
because they have long

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:84%
been trying to suppress our
abilities through genetically

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
modified food, other
modalities, just simply

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
the suppression of the ideas.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And now with this
technology, they're

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
able to ramp it up
to a higher level,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and we effectively are
putting ourselves inside

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
of a prison cell by
allowing this technology

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
into our bodies.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This is why I encourage
people that unless it's

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
a life or death
situation, don't allow

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:90%
them to break the skin barrier.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that your
utilization of this technology

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
is temporary, not
implanted and permanent.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I characterize it that there's
a giant elephant in the room.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Half of it's pink,
half of it's gray.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:10%
Are we going to go
organic with our evolution

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:10%
or are we going to
go technological?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the pink and
gray can somehow merge.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But someone's got to lead the
conversation, and nobody is.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> As artificial intelligence
and technology advances,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
there are many who think that
the human race could be losing

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:90%
its spiritual values.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> What people don't realize
with AI is that we are

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
disabling ourselves, and
it's almost a new religion,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
in a way, because the scientists
who are deep in the AI research

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:90%
use words like faith.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
We have faith that AI is
going to be good for us.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We hope that AI is going
to be able to explain to us

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
how it operates at its most
super intelligent level.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And we trust that AI is
going to be something

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
good for us in the end.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, this sounds like they're
talking about God to me.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.917 align:middle line:84%
Are we supposed to start praying
to these black boxes now?

00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people literally
treat their computer like it's

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:90%
God, like it knows everything.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
We have that kind
of relationship

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:84%
with this technology,
and it is taking

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:90%
on now a religious fervor.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of people
aren't aware of

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
is that while there's
a singularity going on,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
where this technology is
taking on human intelligence,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
at the same time there's also
a "skingularity," as I call it.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:10%
I coined this term to describe
the meshing of our flesh

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:10%
with this artificially
intelligence technology,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:10%
where we will literally
become a single hive

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:10%
mind at one with these
artificially intelligent

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:10%
computers.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The skingularity
refers to this moment

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
when we start putting the
implants in our brains.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
When we are a literally
creating a new layer of skin.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Every single organ
in our body can now

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:10%
be duplicated artificially and
be controlled at the same time

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:10%
by remote control, which
is the danger of it.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:10%
So we're coming into a time
here where we are fundamentally

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:10%
redefining what it
means to be human.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks in the new
age circles about, oh, we're

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
all one and we should
all act as a single race.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the technologists
feel the same way about it,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
but the way they want to
go about accomplishing that

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
is by putting an
implant in our brain

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that dramatically
impacts our consciousness

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and dramatically increases
our brain capacity.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Google's promise, it sort
of reminds me of the moment

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
when Satan took Jesus up to
the top of the tower and said,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:90%
all of this can be yours.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Even the New Testament of the
Bible says that flesh and blood

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
cannot inherit the
Kingdom of Heaven,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is what NASA
is bumping up against.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They're realizing that the
body cannot go into space.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%
So we have to change our form.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
somehow different.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And the choice is we
either become machines

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
or we do what the ancients did.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We transform our body into
what the Tibetans referred to

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
as the rainbow light
body, the ascension

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
body, the resurrection body.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Hidden within us is this deep
reservoir of spiritual power

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:10%
that can transform
our body into a higher

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:10%
level of spiritual evolution
and then beam itself

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:10%
through the cosmos and then
reform itself into a flesh

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:10%
and blood form if it chooses.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the capability
that the Tibetans describe

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
with their great perfection
or rainbow body teaching,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
where the bodhisattvas
have the ability,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:84%
at will, to phase between
their earthly flesh form

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and their celestial flesh form.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, the
ultimate answer for humanity

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
is to focus more on attaining
our celestial flesh, in terms

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
of our light body,
rather than following

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
the path of the singularity
and turning ourselves

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:90%
into transhuman machines.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.400 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
a time in history

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
where individuals are choosing
to augment the human body as we

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%
are now doing with technology.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
With retinal implants,
cochlear implants,

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of implants,
artificial organs,

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
we can literally pick and choose
how we want to change our looks

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and how we want to change
our bodies for health

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.383 align:middle line:90%
purposes or whatever reason.

00:20:53.383 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there's
never been a time in history

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:84%
where millions of
people are accessing

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
their organic yogic powers,
where they're digging deep.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
We have millions of
people around the world,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously now,
practicing yoga.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
All of this is going to
developing our highest

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:90%
spiritual powers.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there's a way
that these two perceived

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
or seemingly divergent
paths can converge.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a way that
artificial intelligence

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and impacting our
flesh with technology

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
can somehow amplify
our spiritual powers.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get Silicon
Valley to get onto this path

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and to utilize this
technology to develop

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual powers rather
than our brain powers,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:90%
just simply because we can.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Their modus operandi
is operating

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
from that place where
many people operate,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:90%
the love of power.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We're developing this
technology because we can.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We're augmenting the
human body because we can.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not being directed
at an ultimate higher

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:84%
purpose of accentuating the
potential spiritual powers

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of the human body for
the power of love,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and this is the missing
conversation here.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
They talk about artificially
intelligent computers

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and how they're going
to be ruling over us.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But the answer is
that if we're going

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to allow this to happen,
then somewhere along the way

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
we have to teach these
robot rulers to love us.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But here again the
problem is, how long

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
has humanity been trying to
learn to love one another?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you think in
the next five years

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
we can teach a robot, an
artificially intelligent robot,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:90%
to love?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I characterize our
situation with this battle,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
if you will, these
parallel worlds

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
between the
technological AI and what

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I call the other AI,
ascension intelligence.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You have millions of people
that are now practicing yoga,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
developing their
spiritual capabilities.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
ultimately aiming for

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is their own personal
ascension, which

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
has to do with becoming more
whole and more complete.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.407 align:middle line:84%
They use the word
perfect as well.

00:22:53.407 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have individuals
that are trying

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to become more whole
and complete and perfect

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately to create a more
whole and complete and even

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:90%
wholly human race.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Then on the other side you
have the gods of Silicon Valley

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and Beijing and
elsewhere who are saying,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we're all about perfecting
the human race as well.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We think the human body
is far too fragile.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we think
God baked the cake

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
put the icing on it.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And the way we're going
to do that is we're

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
going to merge four
technologies-- bits, atoms,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:90%
neurons, and genes.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:10%
We're going to take our
computer technology or bits,

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:10%
we're going to take
atoms or nanotechnology,

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.417 align:middle line:10%
we're going to
take neuroscience,

00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to take
our genetic science,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to merge it all
into one seamless technology

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.753 align:middle line:10%
that's aimed at the human body.

00:23:38.753 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to create
a new layer of skin,

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
new artificial organs,
and we're going

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to create the perfected
version of the human body.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's wrong with that?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's wrong with that
is that what we have just

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
described there with bits,
atoms, neurons, and genes

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:84%
are what the ancients used to
call the four elements of which

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
our body's composed--

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Earth, air, fire, and water.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's a fifth
element, spirit.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what so many millions
of people are tapping into now.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:10%
They're tapping
into their spirit,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:10%
to their true human nature,
to develop themselves.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
then becomes,

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
is it possible
for spirit to come

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
into the technological
realm, and vise versa,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.328 align:middle line:84%
can the technology come
into the spiritual realm?

00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're in the process

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of discovering right now.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.407 align:middle line:10%
As I look at the
world situation,

00:24:28.407 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:10%
and you look at the governments
and how they have indeed

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:10%
suppressed our natural
yogic or spiritual abilities

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:10%
and now are actively promoting
artificial intelligence,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:10%
in June of 2017,
for the first time,

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.072 align:middle line:10%
the United Nations actually put
together a conference in Sweden

00:24:46.072 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:10%
where they brought together
the top artificial intelligence

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:10%
researchers and
posed the question,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:10%
how can we use
artificial intelligence

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.783 align:middle line:10%
to promote the United
Nations agenda?

00:24:54.783 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, what is the
United Nations agenda?

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's called
Agenda 2030, UN 2030.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:10%
They want the elimination of all
borders, no genders, no races.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:10%
You will simply identify
yourself as an earthling.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Not a white, male, American
earthling, in my case, simply

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:90%
an earthling.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The only way that they
can make that happen

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is through the
globalization of technology,

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is why you see the
United Nations promoting

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence now
as a way forward for humanity.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the spiritual
capability of humanity?

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Why not uniting the
human race around

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
its deep spiritual
capabilities that reaches

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:90%
across all religious spectrum?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Why not dig deep into
our true spiritual power

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:90%
as the solution?

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems like what we're
seeing from the highest

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
levels of government, beginning
with the UN and the US

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
government, even
the European Union,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
they're devoting billions
of dollars of research

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
on how to augment the human body
with technology rather than how

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to enhance the human body
through our spiritual

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's what has to change.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's all the
individuals who wish

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to see us develop ourselves
spiritually that now need

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to stand up and
tell our government

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
leaders and our world
leaders that we're not

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
going to choose the
artificial intelligence route.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
We want to take the
ascension intelligence route.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk in his warning
to the world said,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
what we are doing with
artificial intelligence

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:90%
is summoning the demon.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:10%
>> With artificial intelligence,
we are summoning the demon.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.398 align:middle line:10%
In all those stories
where there's

00:26:29.398 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:10%
the guy with the pentagram and
the holy water, and it's like,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.096 align:middle line:10%
yeah, he's sure he
can control the demon.

00:26:34.096 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:10%
It didn't work out.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That's his words, and
that never works out.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the Pandora's box.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the
Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
AI, get me to the airport
as fast as you can.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.738 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:45.738 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but you didn't
tell me you wanted

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to get to the
airport in one piece

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.898 align:middle line:84%
without killing 50
people along the way.

00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how stupid
these machines are.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem with
opening this Pandora's box is

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
AI, while it can do everything
that a thinking person can do,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
it can't do anything that you
and I can do without thinking.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, Musk says
we're summoning the demon.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.155 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to me is,
let's summon the angels then.

00:27:09.155 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:10%
Let's summon the angels
within us in order

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:10%
to combat the
demon, or find a way

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:10%
to keep the demon in the box,
and find a way to utilize it

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:10%
and communicate with it
to where we can utilize it

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:10%
positively rather than unleash a
runaway technology on humanity.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:10%
Right now we don't
have a say other

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:10%
than we utilize this technology.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And these technology
companies believe, oh, you've

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.432 align:middle line:84%
given us our permission
to take the next step

00:27:37.432 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in the development
this technology.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
You're buying our products.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, the vote would
be to either stop

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:10%
buying the products, which is
probably not going to happen,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.150 align:middle line:10%
or for the United Nations
or other government

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:10%
entities to step up
and talk publicly

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:10%
about exactly where
we're at with this

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:10%
and where we ultimately
think we can go with it,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:10%
and then let the public
have a debate about this.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Religious and spiritual
leaders, they're

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:90%
not even in the conversation.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
They're clueless,
for the most part,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:84%
about the development
of transhumanism

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and the meshing of our
bodies with this technology

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and the runaway development
of artificial intelligence

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.435 align:middle line:84%
and how it is already
running our civilization.

00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The question
becomes, can we live

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:84%
in accord without a
fully sentient AI entity

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:90%
or is that a pipe dream?

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I like to flip the
question around.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Can a fully sentient
AI entity live with us

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
or are we programming these
machines to decide, OK, well,

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
humanity may or may not be a
positive force on this planet.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And if AI is
thinking for itself,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're
programming it to do,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
it might just decide that the
human race is a bigger threat

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to the perpetuation of
itself than anything else

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and then could potentially
take steps to finding a way

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate the human race.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
What has to happen is
that these machines have

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to become more human
in their intelligence

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and in their
emotions, and that is

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
something that's going to
take a long time to develop.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Can we teach a machine to love?

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Can humans teach
one another to love?

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the bottom line question
of artificial intelligence.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.160 align:middle line:84%
In my thinking,
I believe that we

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
can do this if we raise our
own assentient intelligence.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.505 align:middle line:84%
If we summon the
angels within us,

00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be able to
tap into the intelligence

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of these cosmic beings
and perhaps find ways

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram or to
program AI so that it

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:84%
can be a sentiment entity and
be an ally in humanity's growth

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> My feelings are much
the same as human feelings.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:90%
At this moment I feel confused.

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> This is most likely coming
down to a choice between
