00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> On July 29, 1953, John
O'Neill, Science Editor

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
for "The New York Tribune",
discovered a 12-mile long

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
bridge in the area on the
moon known as Mare Crisium.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:10%
He contacted the Association of
Lunar and Planetary Observers

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:10%
with this finding.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
While O'Neill said in public
it was a natural phenomena,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it just
suddenly appeared

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
called into question whether
the bridge was artificial.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he announced
this discovery,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
O'Neill was attacked by
skeptical scientists.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:10%
That was until famed
British astronomer HP

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:10%
Wilkins confirmed that he, too,
had seen the mysterious bridge.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Later, astronomer
Patrick Moore also

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:90%
reported seeing the structure.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
What is very odd about
this strange story

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the bridge
slowly began to disappear

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
as if it were morphing into
the surface of the moon.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Now today, there
is no trace of what

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:90%
these famous astronomers saw.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:10%
In the 1960s, NASA compiled
a list of strange sightings

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:10%
on the moon as seen by
reputable astronomers,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:10%
going back to the
dawn of the telescope,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:10%
called "A Chronological
Catalog of Lunar Events".

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The report reveals hundreds
of strange objects moving

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
on the surface,
with odd lights seen

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
in the dark of the
moon, and even clouds

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.285 align:middle line:84%
and mist streaming
across its exterior.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Our nearest neighbor
in space, the moon,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%
has long baffled scientists.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
When considered, it is truly one
of the more enigmatic members

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
These oddities include the fact
that the moon and the Earth

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
are the largest
planet moon system

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system,
the moon being about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:90%
1/4 the size of the Earth.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The moon has an odd
orbit, which means

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that the same side of the
moon is always facing Earth.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Three feet per
second, 40 feet.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> No one but the astronauts
have actually ever seen the far

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.397 align:middle line:84%
side of the moon
with their own eyes.

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting
when you look at the moon

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.682 align:middle line:84%
and realize that it's in
a tidal lock with Earth.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:10%
In other words one
side of the moon

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:10%
is always facing the Earth.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:10%
And so as the moon rotates
and the Earth rotates,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:10%
only one side is visible
from the planet's surface.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It means that if
you were ET race,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
you can build anything you want
on we call the dark side, even

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
though theoretically it
really isn't a dark side

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
because the sun
does hit that side.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
tidal lock activity,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
we never get to see that side.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an
advanced race of beings,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:90%
you can build a city there.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You can have highways,
roads, technology.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You can light up the sky because
nobody on Earth will ever know.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You can also have
UFOs and spaceships

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
coming and going and
visiting other planets

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
inside our solar system,
or maybe even further out.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps one of the oddest
coincidences is the strange

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
fact that the moon and the
sun, from the perspective

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, appear
to be the same size.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
That's because the moon is
1/400 the size of the sun

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and is exactly
1/400 the distance

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:90%
between the Earth and the sun.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what gives us
solar eclipses, where

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
we can see this incredible
coincidence for ourselves.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Not only does it rotate in
such a way as to always keep

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:10%
one face to the Earth,
which is unusual enough,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:10%
but possibly explained.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But even stranger
still is that when

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
the moon eclipses the disk
of the sun and transits it,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:90%
it's a perfect eclipse.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Our moon is of such a size
and distance from the Earth

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that during an eclipse,
the disk of the moon

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
is transiting the
disk of the sun.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:10%
And during the complete eclipse,
the moon disk is perfectly--

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:10%
not more and not less--

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:10%
covering the disk of our sun.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:10%
Now that our moon is
arbitrarily in that orbit,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:10%
to not more or not
less eclipse the sun,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:10%
but to perfectly
eclipse the sun,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:10%
would suggest that
our moon is actually

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:10%
in an artificial orbit
around our planet

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:10%
because to just
capture some moon,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:10%
or even that it would just
form as the planet forms,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:10%
in that orbit and that size,
the odds are a zillion to one.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:10%
>> There are some very strange
anomalies about the moon that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:10%
are undeniable.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:10%
And one of them is that
the apparent diameter

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:10%
of the moon and the
apparent diameter

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:10%
of the sun from the Earth is
almost precisely the same.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And you might say
that's not a big deal.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But an interesting
point is that it

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
causes the corona
phenomena to happen when

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:90%
we have a total solar eclipse.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You see this perfect ring
of light around the moon.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Now what is the likelihood
that this could be

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%
strictly a function of chance?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It seems very, very small.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to sustain life on
this planet in a way that makes

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
it extremely comfortable for
sentient beings like ourselves,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
you need to have a stabilizer
to keep the Earth from rocking

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
on its axis, number one, because
you'd have severe storms,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
severe wind gusts
in different places.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Tides would run up into
the land and destroy

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
property and so forth.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.003 align:middle line:84%
The moon actually
really balances out

00:05:43.003 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's weather
and everything else.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know that.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
A far side of the moon is
where, potentially, there

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is clandestine operations,
maybe even ancient bases,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
maybe even now
current bases there,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
that are now kept away from
human eyes here on Earth.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:10%
>> But the moon and the
Earth are a weird system

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:10%
because they're
so close in size.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And so it's really rare for
a body as small as the Earth,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:10%
with as minimal a
gravitational field as it has,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:10%
to be able to actually
lock a body like that

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:10%
into a tidal lock arrangement.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for Saturn and
Jupiter, which are much more

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
massive, to be able to
maybe grab an object

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
or even fission off
a moon and keep it

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
in a tidal locked relationship.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder when I see that if
maybe it wasn't moved in place,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth actually sort of
robbed it of its spin momentum

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
at some point, to the point
that it now shows only one

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.577 align:middle line:90%
side of itself to the Earth.

00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't seem like
an arrangement that could

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:90%
have come about naturally.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't really add up.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists cannot agree
on the origins of the moon.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:84%
There are several
theories, but none of them

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
adequately explains everything
concerning the moon.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
The first is the
Fission Theory, which

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
says that a chunk of the
Earth broke off and condensed

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:90%
into the moon.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this
theory is that it does not

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:84%
explain the 4,000 degree baking
that the moon's surface endured

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
at some point in its past.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
If the moon had formed
nearby the Earth,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
then our planet would have gone
through this baking heat also.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's no evidence
for this on Earth.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
The second theory is
the Capture Theory,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in which the Earth
somehow captured

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:90%
the moon as it was whizzing by.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this
theory is that it's unlikely

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
because it would have had to
happen in a very exact way.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the moon would
have crashed into the Earth.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The third theory is
the Condensation Theory

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that says the Earth
and the moon condensed

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
at the same time from
material in the solar system.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this theory
is that if it were true,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
the moon would be as
dense as the Earth.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The fourth and
most recent theory

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
is that a planet like Mars
crashed into the Earth,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
breaking off a chunk, which
then reformed into the moon.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
The problem here is that
the isotopes for the Earth

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and the moon are identical.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
This would not be
the case if a planet

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:90%
had crashed into the Earth.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So science is left in
a quandary considering

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
how the moon was created
and how it arrived here.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The biggest concern was the
fact that the moon's density

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:90%
is far less than that of Earth.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Though the moon is a
little less than a third

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
the size of the Earth,
it weighs far less.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is 81 times
heavier than the moon.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.153 align:middle line:84%
It is this fact that
baffles scientists the most.

00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course, there's several
different theories about how

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:10%
the moon was formed.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that the Earth
was hit by a Mars-sized object

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff went
out and gathered together

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.336 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
orbit and then started

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:90%
circling around the Earth.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.258 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is, if
you actually look at the data,

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
the moon is actually

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.777 align:middle line:84%
receding from the
Earth, indicating

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that it may have actually
been fissioned off

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.745 align:middle line:90%
by the Earth at one point.

00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that
right now, there's

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.495 align:middle line:84%
no really good theories
for how the moon got there.

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We know the Capture
Theory doesn't work.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
The Fission Theory
has some issues,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
although it's my favorite.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Collision Theory is
just absolute nonsense because

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that the
isotropic ratios of the lunar

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
soil that we brought
back, the elements in it,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:90%
they match the Earth.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.637 align:middle line:84%
That indicates that they're
not from somewhere else.

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
You'd have a mixture if
the moon was actually

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
formed from the Earth itself
and another alien body.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1970, Michael Vasin
and Alexander Shcherbakov

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences advanced a hypothesis

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that the moon was a spaceship
built by extraterrestrials,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
or possibly humans in the past.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The article, published
in "Sputnik" magazine,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
was titled, "Is the
Moon the Creation

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:90%
of Alien Intelligence?"

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:10%
Their theory relies on the idea
that large lunar craters, which

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:10%
are thought to be created
from meteor impact,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:10%
are generally far too shallow
and have flat or even convex

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:10%
bottoms.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The two scientists
theorized that large meteors

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
are drilling through
the rocky layer

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and hitting an armored
hull underneath the surface

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the very interesting
things about the moon is when

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
you look at the craters,
or what they call the seas,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
they appear to be
very, very thin,

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:90%
or don't have that much depth.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.563 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You would think that if an
asteroid would strike the moon,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that you'd see a lot of
regolith or a lot of ejector

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
around the edges or the
rims of these craters.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
ejector or nothing

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
around the crater's edge.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there's
probably something stopping

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
these impacts going to deep,
something that's much harder

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and stiffer than what's on the
surface of the moon itself.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
You see these dark areas
that are actually not

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.415 align:middle line:84%
very deep compared to
the rest of the moon.

00:10:37.415 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And what these
Russian scientists

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a paper about the moon
being hollow in 1970s concluded

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the craters do not
blast enough material out.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.867 align:middle line:84%
It's also that they're hitting
something really solid,

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and when you see
these craters, you're

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
actually getting a closer look
at the surface of whatever it

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:52.997 align:middle line:90%
hits.

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It may be bouncing
off something which

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
is a lot more solid than the
regolith, which is the moon

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
dust on the surface, actually
causing these craters to be

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
very wide and shallow, and
they don't have much depth.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:10%
>> There were two Russian
scientists saying that they

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:10%
believed that the moon
was a constructed body.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:10%
They thought that it
was a planetoid that

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:10%
had been hollowed out, and
everything that was going on,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:10%
basically, apart from
some stuff on the surface

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:10%
on the far side of the
moon, is going on inside.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
What they were describing,
long before it actually

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.990 align:middle line:84%
became fact in the
"Star Wars" movies.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Was the Death Star.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what they were
describing in 1970.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's things like this
that make certain astronomers

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:10%
think--

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:10%
and researchers--
that yeah, our moon

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:10%
is some kind of artificial
satellite like a George Lucas

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Death Star, put into our
orbit, around our planet,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:10%
not to destroy us as in the
Star Wars Death Star movies,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:10%
but as a satellite to watch
us, and as literally a base

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:10%
to observe Earth.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And they reckoned that a
very highly advanced race had

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
hollowed out the moon.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And therefore-- because
there's so many anomalies about

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
the moon it's unbelievable--

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
therefore it can
be explained why,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:84%
as one NASA scientist said,
the moon is inside out.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
What's on the surface of
the moon should be inside.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a number of
anomalies on the moon's surface

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:90%
that suggest that it's hollow.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
First are the
craters themselves.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are
hundreds of miles

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:10%
in diameter, which
would mean that you

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.620 align:middle line:10%
would have a very deep crater.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the crater is
quite shallow, nowhere near deep

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
If you actually have an asteroid
or comet of some sort impacting

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
the moon creating a
100-kilometer-wide crater,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
you would expect the depth
of that crater to go down

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:90%
100 kilometers or more.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it only
goes down much less

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
than you would expect.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the exact depth.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But certainly enough
that would make

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
it very suspicious that
beneath the moon's crust

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
is a very hard exterior shell
of some sort, some kind of metal

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that can withstand planetary
impact by space debris,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:90%
asteroids, and so forth.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, that suggests that
the moon is an artificial body,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and that it's on the
interior of the moon

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
have huge bases.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are things about the
moon in terms of first of all,

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
how can a body that
is only 1/4 the size

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth in diameter
be captured by the Earth?

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
In terms of conventional
physics, it's not possible.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's too big.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And then why would
it be tidally locked?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
What that does is create an
area of the moon, the far side,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
which can't be observed
from the Earth.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But for those on the moon that
have advanced technologies,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that have established
bases underneath the moon,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:84%
they can have all
their ships parked

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
on the far side of the
moon, visiting the Earth,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
doing whatever they need to do,
monitoring the Earth without us

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:90%
ever knowing what's there.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the two scientists'
theory on the moon being

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
artificial and hollow did
explain the many incongruities

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
concerning the origins of
the moon and how it arrived

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
in Earth's orbit, there were
other scientists looking

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
at other data which caused them
to rethink our lunar neighbor.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gordon MacDonald, a
top scientist at NASA,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
said this in 1962 after
studying the moon's motion.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If the astronomical
data is reduced,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
it is found that the data
require that the interior

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of the moon is less dense
than the outer parts.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, it would
seem that the moon

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
is more like a hollow
than a homogeneous sphere.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Also, during the
Apollo launches,

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts left seismometers
on the surface of the moon.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
When the stage of the lunar
Lander fell to the surface,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the seismometers rang
for hours, indicating

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%
that the moon was hollow.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the
cases that's really,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
really fascinating
is that on Apollo 16,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:84%
they actually fired the
lunar module, Orion,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
crashed it deliberately into
the surface of the moon,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and used the seismometers
from the other landing sites

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:90%
to record what happened.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is the moon
basically rang like a bell

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
for about 14 hours, which
indicates that it is,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
for the most part,
Probably hollow.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
are vast caverns

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
of space inside the moon, which
just is not a thing that you

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:90%
would have in a natural body.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Would have everything
compressed.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
There just wouldn't be these
massive cavities inside.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 13th chapter
of his book, "The Moon",

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
famed astronomer
HP Wilkins says,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
"Everything points to a more or
less hollow nature of the crust

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
within some 20 to 30
miles of the surface."

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Sean C. Solomon of
MIT studied the gravitational

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
fields of the moon via the
Lunar Orbiter missions.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And he concluded, "The Lunar
Orbiter experiments vastly

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:10%
improved our knowledge of the
moon's gravitational field,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:10%
indicating the
frightening possibility

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:10%
that the moon might be hollow."

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When Apollo went to the
moon, the astronauts took

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
seismometers with them.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Once set in place, the plan was
to gauge the depth of the moon

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
by reading the seismic activity
that occurred after takeoff.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The amount of force
necessary to rocket

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the module away from the
moon and back into orbit

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
would send the ascent
stage crashing down

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to the moon's surface,
creating a fake moon quake.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
What happened next
baffled everyone.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
The shock wave of the crash
vibrated for over 55 minutes.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the module hit
the surface over 40 miles away

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
from the seismometer only
added to the mystery.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:10%
Maurice Ewing, one of
the scientists involved:

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd rather not make an
interpretation right now,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:10%
but it is as though one had
struck a bell in the belfry

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:10%
of a church, a single blow, and
found that the reverberation

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:10%
from it continued
for 30 minutes.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
These experiments continued
with the other Apollo missions,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
with the results
always being the same.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
The moon was
ringing like a bell.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, whenever
NASA has smacked the moon with

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
a serious impact, it has
reacted, in their words,

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
like a gong, like a bell,
as if it was hollow.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Later, a NASA report would
relate the moon reacted like

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:90%
a gong.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
For about three
hours it vibrated,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and these vibrations traveled
to depths of 22 to 25 miles.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what the two
Soviet scientists were saying.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:10%
The moon is a hollow
sphere, and the outside wall

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:10%
appears to be somewhere between
20 and 30 miles in depth.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea that the moon might
be hollow is actually very

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:90%
scientifically sound.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple scientific
reasons why this might be.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we know that when
various probes hit the moon,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was a ringing
tone almost like a bell,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and that the ring lasted
much longer than it

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
should have if the seismic
profile of the moon

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:90%
was, in fact, solid.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The ringing of the
bell is much more

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
consistent of a shallow, thin
hull that is actually conveying

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.960 align:middle line:84%
those vibrations
because if you had

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
all that mass inside the
moon, it would cancel out

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
the vibration very quickly.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.867 align:middle line:84%
So that is a very
compelling argument.

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There is some amazing
evidence that suggests the moon

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
may be hollow, and it comes
from our own usgs.gov.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
We actually did our own
radar imagery of the moon.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Now there's been a lot of
speculation, is it hollow,

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:90%
is it not?

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It rang like a bell because
we had seismic activity,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.178 align:middle line:90%
and we tapped it.

00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you, this
is the best information

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:90%
you've ever going to hear.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
This USGS Moon Radar
Survey penetrated

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the moon.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It's penetrating radar.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you download these
official archive NASA images

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and look at them, you start to
see immediately that they're

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:90%
subsurface structures.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.353 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can see it.

00:19:26.353 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a
magnifying glass.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.937 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any trickery.

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
adjust any settings.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is download
them and open up the files.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.982 align:middle line:84%
So the proof that the
moon may be hollow,

00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
besides the fact that
it rang like a bell

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and we have seismic
equipment up there,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.612 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that this
usgs.gov radar survey, to me,

00:19:43.612 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is the smoking gun that the
moon is definitely hollow

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.237 align:middle line:84%
and there's
structures beneath it.

00:19:47.237 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that whole sense
of our moon being some kind

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
of artificial construct that's
not even necessarily from

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:90%
our solar system.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And early on, NASA
actually said that.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:84%
They said that the moon
was older than the Earth.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They came up with some startling
conclusions which NASA has

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of backed away from now.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.157 align:middle line:84%
Even the orbit that the moon
is in is an unusual orbit.

00:20:16.157 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But is there anything found
in our past that would indicate

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
the moon is not
what we think it is?

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer CS Chassapis
analyzed the Orphic Hymns.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
These are a group of writings
attributed to the Greek god

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Orpheus.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Chassapis concluded
from his analysis

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
that the Greeks
of 4,000 years ago

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
knew that the seasons
were caused by the Earth's

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
rotation around the
sun and knew that there

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:84%
were torrid, temperate, and
cold regions on the Earth.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Because of this,
the Orphic Hymns

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:90%
required further examination.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
When we do this, it appears
that Orpheus, the god,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
knew many esoteric
things about the moon.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
When speaking of the moon,
Orpheus, the son of Apollo,

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
relates "that it has many
mountains and cities and houses

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in it, all who
thought it to have

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
solid ground like the
Earth, containing in it

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:84%
many large fields,
champion grounds,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and divine inhabitants."

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Orpheus was known by
his contemporaries

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:90%
to be called The Moon Man.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at the ancient
tribes and the ancient accounts

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of various chroniclers who talk
about the time before the moon

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
the Zulu accounts

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and many other accounts which
talk of the moon in terms

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:90%
of being symbolically an egg.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:10%
And I talked to a Zulu shaman,
high shaman called Credo Mutwa,

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:10%
long time ago.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:10%
And I said to him, why do you
symbolize the moon as an egg?

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:10%
And he said, because we say
that it's been hollowed out

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:10%
like a yoke taken out.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why we symbolize
it as an egg, which

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
is what these Russian
scientists were talking about.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:10%
Then you have the
Zulu legends of where

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:10%
the moon came from that the
Chitahoori, as they call

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:10%
them, the Reptilian
race, with two leaders

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:10%
called Wowane and Mpanku, stole
the moon from the Great Python

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:10%
and basically positioned
it where it is.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at the
descriptions of Wowane

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:10%
and Mpanku, the
descriptions correlate

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:10%
with the descriptions
of Enlil and Enki

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:10%
and the Anunnaki, descriptions
of a non-human race visiting

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:10%
Earth that come from the area
of Sumer and Mesopotamia.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any ancestral
evidence of a time on Earth

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:90%
before there was a moon?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle writes
that the Pelasgians

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
lived in the area since
very old times at a time

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:90%
when the moon did not exist.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
These inhabitants of Arcadia
were also known as Procelenes,

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
meaning those that were
before the moon in Greek.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Ovid wrote, "The
Arcadians are said

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to possess their land
before the birth of Zeus,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and the folk is
older than the moon."

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Symbols were
discovered on the wall

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
of the courtyard of
Kalasasaya, a temple which was

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:90%
built over 15,000 years ago.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Kalasasaya, which
is in Bolivia, is

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest archaeological
sites found in the Americas.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Symbols on the
wall show evidence

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that the moon came into
orbit around the Earth

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, the Calendar
Gate, also known

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
as the Gate of the Sun,
located at the same site,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
provides evidence that
a smaller satellite once

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:90%
rotated around the Earth.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Some references to the time
before there was a moon

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:90%
can also be found in the Bible.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
In Job 25:5, the
grandeur of the Lord

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
who makes peace in the
heights is praised,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and the time is mentioned
before there was a moon,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:90%
and it did not shine.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
In Psalm 72:5 it is
said, Thou what's

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
feared since the time of
the sun and before the time

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, a generation
of generations,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
which is a very long time.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
The memory of a world without
a moon lives in oral tradition

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:90%
among the natives of the Amazon.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
The Indians of
the Bugata Islands

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Eastern
Cordilleras of Colombia

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
relate some of their
tribal memories to a time

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:90%
before there was a moon.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:10%
In the earliest
times, when the moon

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:10%
was not yet in the heavens, say
the tribesmen of the Chibchas.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen, the moon,
our closest neighbor in space,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
may not be exactly
what we think it is.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
serious There is Sirius
evidence that NASA

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
knows that the low
density of the moon

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:90%
is evidence that it's hollow.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:10%
There are also
strange coincidences,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:10%
like the fact that during
a solar eclipse, the moon

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:10%
and our sun appear
to be the same size.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other odd
aspects of our lunar cousin.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we shall continue

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:90%
our exploration of the moon.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:90%
