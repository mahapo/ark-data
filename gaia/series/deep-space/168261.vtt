00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In the early 1950s, as
Operation Paperclip was

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
happening, the CIA became
interested in the mind control

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
programs that were perfected
by the Germans during World War

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:90%
II.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:10%
>> George White was not a man
of understatement or subtleties.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:10%
His boss at OSS, Stanley
Lovell, referred to him

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:10%
as deadly and dedicated.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:10%
In this note from
White's diaries

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:10%
it says, "Call
Lovell regarding TD."

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.057 align:middle line:10%
TD was a rather transparent
cover for truth drug.

00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:10%
George White worked with
the Truth Drug Committee

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:10%
here at St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in the nation's capital.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:10%
They experimented with
mescaline, scopolamine,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:10%
and marijuana on
unwitting victims.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:10%
The committee soon learned there
was no easy panacea, no truth

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
drug at this stage.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:10%
But White and later colleagues
would not stop trying.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:10%
The goal remained the same.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:10%
As this 1952 CIA
memo says, the aim

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:10%
is "controlling an
individual to the point where

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:10%
he will do our bidding
against his will

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:10%
and even against such
fundamental laws of nature

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:10%
as self-preservation."

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:10%


00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:10%
But it was a discovery
here, in Basel, Switzerland,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:10%
at Sandoz Laboratories,
by Dr. Albert Hofmann,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.438 align:middle line:10%
that led the intelligence
agencies of America

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:10%
to believe that they
had found the panacea.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:10%
The discovery was lysergic
acid diethylamide, LSD.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:10%
The film that you see is
considered by many experts

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:10%
to be the closest
illustration of the effects

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:10%
of a hallucinogenic.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:10%


00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
>> It was one of the first
times that anybody had run

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:10%
into a powerful drug that was
different than anything else

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:10%
that they knew anything about.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:10%
>> John Gittinger, recently
retired Chief Psychologist

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:10%
for the CIA.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:10%
This is the first time Gittinger
has been interviewed publicly.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:10%
>> You could disable a whole
city by putting a very small

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:10%
amount in a water supply.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:10%
After all of these
years of us, those of us

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:10%
who are involved in looking
for this secret drug,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.593 align:middle line:10%
this was the only
thing that began

00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:10%
to look for the
first time like it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:10%
might be something like that.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>> By the end of the 1950s,
the CIA had created a plethora

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:10%
of programs that were designed
to change the way humans think

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:10%
and behave.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, these
programs would also

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
target the media, education,
and even Hollywood.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MKUltra is probably the most
famous of the US mind control

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:10%
It's an iconic program, and
it's been in movies galore.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all about mind control.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.652 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
about MKUltra is, A,

00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:90%
it was secret for many years.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
No one had any inkling
that this was going on.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking some
horrific, off-the-chart,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:10%
Frankenstein-type experiments.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:10%
We're talking sensory
deprivation experiments

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:10%
on unwilling and unwitting
humans subject, some of them

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:10%
terminal.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of this stuff done at the
Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:10%
And some of them done
off American soil

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:10%
by the really truly evil
Dr. Ewen Cameron, formerly

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:10%
head of the World
Psychiatric Association

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:10%
over at McGill
University in Canada,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:10%
where he did, in
addition to lobotomies

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:10%
on women in menopause because
they were having anxiety,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:10%
he did what he called
psychic driving.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
This is all for the CIA.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Lovely stuff here
in the early 1960s.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:10%
So in other words, the
idea was, he would somehow

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:10%
find a way of emptying their
minds of unhealthy thoughts,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:10%
however he determined that,
and driving in thoughts

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:10%
that he thought were positive.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how
utterly sick this was?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:84%
This was the head, one of the
most prestigious psychiatrists

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.655 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Sir, I know what it
feels like to be God.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Operation
Mockingbird, it's called.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a whole project to
infiltrate Central Intelligence

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:10%
Agency people into the media
and to put out false stories

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:10%
and to suppress truthful
stories and affect the news,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:10%
and they undoubtedly
do that in Hollywood.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any doubt of that.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.057 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's an interesting
thing when Richard Condon wrote

00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
"The Manchurian Candidate"
in the late '50s.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.687 align:middle line:10%
It was interesting
because he was really

00:04:57.687 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:10%
focusing on the Chinese
and the North Koreans.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee you,
by the late '50s,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the US was so far ahead of
the Chinese and North Koreans,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and probably even the
Russians, in what we would

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.862 align:middle line:90%
call brainwashing techniques.

00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And I don't really
know what Condon knew,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:10%
but I suspect he
knew quite a bit.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Our Intelligence Community has
just done all of these things.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, they did
it with their own cache

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:10%
of imported Nazi scientists
courtesy of Project Paperclip.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, guys.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But by swallowing the
Nazi pill, which is really

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
what America did after World
War II, we, in a lot of ways,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
became the enemy that
we fought against.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The irony is that in World
War II, we fought the Nazis

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:90%
and then became the Nazis.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The irony is that
during the Cold War,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
we opposed the Soviets and
now become the Soviets.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Nietzsche always said,
beware of fighting monsters

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:90%
lest you become one.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
We're there.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind control for an
MKUltra program was a very,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
very specific major
biophysical manipulation.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
This other thing of
propaganda and trying to--

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
they refer to it as public
diplomacy against the United

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.115 align:middle line:90%
States people.

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's not
any doubt about that,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're engaged in
propaganda, in trying

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
to mold public opinion.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what Operation
Mockingbird is all about,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
putting them into the
media and planting stories.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Other experiments
were not as conventional.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:10%
Neurophysicist Dr.
Jose Delgado was

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:10%
financed by the Office
of Naval Research.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:10%
In this experiment,
the bull is sedated.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Electrodes are
implanted in its brain.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Delgado transmits an
electronic impulse

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:10%
to the center of
the bull's brain.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:10%
Delgado has remote
control of the animal.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:10%
Recently released
CIA documents refer

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:10%
to the feasibility of
remote control of animals

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and that special
investigations will

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:10%
be conducted toward the
application of selected

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:10%
elements of these
techniques to man.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Other areas were examined
through the '60s and '70s--

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:10%
brain surgery,
psychosurgery, creation

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:10%
of amnesia, parapsychology,
manipulation of genes--

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:10%
even though past and
present CIA officials

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:10%
have indicated this kind
of work ended in 1963.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.452 align:middle line:84%
>> So the whole
point of MKUltra,

00:07:39.452 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and these are the
people who really were,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.075 align:middle line:84%
they were
experimenting with LSD.

00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
These are the people who clearly
were responsible for murdering

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Frank Olson out of the
10th floor of the Statler

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Hotel in New York
City back in 1953

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
after they gave him
a bad acid trip.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Frank Olson was a major
US bioweapons expert,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and they were just messing with
him, and they destroyed him.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
MKUltra, it was
secret for 25 years,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
only learned about it as
an accident of history.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
You realize, we could
very easily, to this day,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:90%
have only rumors about MKUltra.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:10%
The only reason we
know MKUltra existed

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:10%
is because Richard
Nixon abruptly

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:10%
fired CIA director Richard
Helms at the end of 1972

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:10%
after Nixon got reelected.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Helms and he were
not really close.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, you got a month
to clean out your desk.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:10%
Helms had one of these
moments where he thought,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:10%
we've got a lot of secrets
here we need to cover,

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:10%
and possibly foremost
among them was MKUltra.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:10%
He told the head of the program,
a guy named Sid Gottlieb, who

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:10%
was another Frankenstein
evil scientist,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:10%
he said, get rid
of the evidence.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>> He retired in 1973 and
destroyed the records of this

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:10%
work.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:10%
In sort of a valedictory
letter, Doctor Gottlieb

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:10%
wrote that he and
his colleagues had

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:10%
been able to maintain
contact with the leading

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:10%
edge of developments
in the field

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:10%
of biological and chemical
control of human behavior.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Gottlieb also testified
before the Senate Subcommittee

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:10%
but from an anteroom
where he could not

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:10%
be filmed because of
what his lawyer termed

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:10%
health and cardiac problems.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Gottlieb declined
"ABC News'" request

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.214 align:middle line:10%
for an interview.

00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Gottlieb did get
rid of a lot of it,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't get
rid of all of it.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:10%
And a researcher named John
Marks, a couple of years later,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:10%
found records pertaining
to finances of MKUltra

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:10%
and other connections and
was able to put it together

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and wrote the first book called
"The Search for the Manchurian

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Candidate."

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And from that, it opened
up and it was confirmed.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So my point here is that we only
know about MKUltra by accident.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
This is how secrets do happen.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
They can go forever and
sometimes beyond forever.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The other thing about
MKUltra is the whole point

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
was to harness the human
soul, the human mind.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And in fact, the American
people acquiesce in that.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, well, you know,
all is fair in love and war.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So we've been in this big
conflict with the Soviet Union

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and/or now Iran and/or
now the ultimate enemy

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of the week, this
Orwellian process

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:90%
of the national security state.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't stop these things
just because everybody

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
finds out that it's horrible
and they ought to stop it.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:90%
They just say they stop it.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:10%
There's a famous
saying in Washington DC

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:10%
that if an agency gets
caught doing something awful,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:10%
they'll change the room
numbers on the rooms.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And if it's really bad, they'll
change the phone number,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:90%
but they won't stop doing it.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to control
people's perception.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:10%
You've got to keep them
in the perceptual box,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:10%
and that's what
this matrix does.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a hijacking of
human sense of reality.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:84%
A fake reality, which again
you see the descriptions of it

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:10%
And we need to see
through this, and fast,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:10%
and realize that we've
not just been had,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:10%
we've not just been
manipulated, we've not just

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:10%
been perceptually enslaved
just a little bit.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The programs were developed
to fool the human race through

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the use of planted
stories and fake news.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But what about
technological advances?

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the problems is that
we have to become cognizant

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
of what the capabilities are
within the Counterintelligence

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.643 align:middle line:84%
Community and the
Intelligence Community.

00:11:45.643 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And I remember,
in the early '90s,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:10%
meeting with a man who was
in his 80s at that time, he's

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:10%
passed away since, who invented
an electromagnetic system so

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:10%
that you could hook
someone up to it, anybody,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:10%
and they would be
able to remote view

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:10%
through the electronic
system but interfacing

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:10%
with consciousness.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this guy said
to me that that also

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.030 align:middle line:84%
had been turned into not
just a passive viewing

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
system but an
active weapon system

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
where you could then turn
it around and target people

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
with experiences
that are 100% real.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting ways
he put it to me he says, look.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, Dr. Greer, if
we want to target you

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a conversation
with your personal God--

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Buddha,
Krishna, whoever--

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:90%
you'll believe it.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:90%
You'll think it's real.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And you will absolutely
pass a lie detector test

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:90%
that it is real.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It is that good.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, that was 1956.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So extrapolate into then
the '70s, the '90s, now,

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
what those capabilities are.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sounds
like an urban myth.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, the only
thing that Wernher von Braun

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
warned about as being more
dangerous than this so-called

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Beam or False
Flag hoaxing an alien attack

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
was the existence of
these technologies

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of the
worst kinds of people

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:90%
and that they were being abused.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:90%
So this gets into the question--

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I knew very well
Dr. Fred Bell, who

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
was a descendant of
Alexander Graham Bell,

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:90%
and he was an MKUltra baby.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, his parents
pretty much handed him over

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
at a very young age to the
Intelligence Community,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and he went through this
kind of programming.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:10%
But he was a genius when it came
to electromagnetic and weapons

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:10%
systems and helped developed
in the '60s, he said,

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:10%
we had platforms up there
that would target ET craft

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and would hit them with
electromagnetic scalar kind

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.138 align:middle line:10%
of weapons and knock them down.

00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They'd fall right
out to the Pacific.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.097 align:middle line:84%
He says, we'd be there, yay,
we killed another alien ship.

00:13:55.097 --> 00:13:57.597 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like something
out of a science fiction movie,

00:13:57.597 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
but this guy was for real.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, he had other things
that he had "learned"

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in his training as an
MKUltra person, which

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I knew was completely
not true, that were,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
let's call it, psychological
conditioning responses

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
so that he would go
along with weaponizing

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
our relationship with the ETs.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And he actually was
totally brainwashed,

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and his mind was
scrambled, and his memory.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But the things
that he would say,

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
which were completely
false, he 100%

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
believed, and I'm
sure it was sincere.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:10%
But these technologies
that I'm referring to,

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:10%
that got quite well
developed by the '50s,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:10%
were set loose on him
and people like him.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like if you had a
superocular rift system that

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
didn't need a headset, but
instead of electromagnetic

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and 3D virtual reality it
was all in consciousness

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
targeted with
electromagnetic systems that

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
would give you an experience,
and you would absolutely

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:90%
think it's real.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What they're trying to
do, and what human society is

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
absolutely structured to do
through manipulation of fear,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
manipulation of low vibrational
emotion, of anxiety, of hatred,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:84%
is to hold the span of frequency
that humans are interacting

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
with possibility within in the
frequency band of the matrix.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in there,
you are in this world

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and you are also of it.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got no other
point of reference,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
no other point of attention,
to actually observe the world

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're experiencing.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You've only got what
you think you can see.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And thus, this is what
the matrix is all about.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:10%
It's about isolating
our point of attention

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:10%
in what I call body
consciousness and label

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, once isolated from
the insight and inspiration

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of expanded awareness, you
take that isolated point

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
of attention and you
program it from cradle

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to grave with the
perception of reality,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
the perception of the world,
the perception of world events,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and the perception
of self that suits

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
your agenda of mass control.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's be careful what we
put out there as fact when it

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
could be scrambled psychotronic
gibberish from people who have

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
been victims, quite frankly,
or targeted by these very

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated
consciousness-interfacing

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:90%
electronic systems.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost the entirety of
humanity lives its life on what

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I call the postage
stamp consensus.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a tiny, tiny
range of possibility,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
a tiny range of how things
are, that most people live

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
their lives.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they come into
the world and it's

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
a perpetual motion
machine, or what I call

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:90%
the perceptual motion machine.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:90%
You come into the world.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, your
parents, who've

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
been through this
programming system,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
start to download that
perception to you.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Not out of malevolence,
but they think

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
this is how things are so
they pass them on to you.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, now, three,
four years maximum,

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:90%
you're at a desk.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got an authority figure
representing the postage stamp

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.152 align:middle line:90%
consensus version of reality.

00:17:29.152 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, this authority
figure is telling you

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
when you have to be
there, when you can leave,

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
when you can eat, when you
can't, when you can speak,

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:90%
when you can go to the toilet.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And all the way through
your formative years,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you are downloading the
perception of reality

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:90%
that I call the postage stamp.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
You then go out at
the end of this,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
having got into enormous
debt at the end of it

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to pay for your own programming
at college and university,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
then you go out into the world
and you go into politics,

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you go into banking, you go into
science, you go into academia,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:90%
you go into journalism.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And you all take with you that
core programming of reality,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
what I call the postage stamp.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all these institutions
confirm to each other

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that the postage stamp
is actually real,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:90%
the postage stamp is credible.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And anyone that steps
off the postage stamp

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:10%
is ridiculed and
condemned in a way that

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:10%
is very much akin to
prisoners in a cell,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:10%
and one prisoner
tries to escape,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:10%
and the other prisoners
stop him getting out,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, is part of
that wonderful analogy of Plato

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:10%
and the analogy
of the cave, which

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:10%
was a brilliant analogy of
what I'm talking about here.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And so people then 24/7 are
getting their information

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
from mainstream
sources, and it's all

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
from the postage stamp.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So from cradle to
grave, not only are we

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
in this fake reality we're
decoding thinking it's real,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
but we are being programmed
day after day after day,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
from womb to cemetery, to
believe in a reality that

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
is about that big
and that anyone who's

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:90%
outside of that is mad or bad.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And this kind of
brainwashing and propaganda,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
these old spy masters
are amazingly good at.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
therefore guard human awareness

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
as we go forward.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:10%
And my only concern, the reason
I left my medical career,

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:10%
was seeing that this
huge problem needed

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:10%
to have some rigor brought
to it, both for disclosure

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:10%
and the technologies,
but also this concept

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness
and the future

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:10%
that should be a vision of
abundance and infinite energy

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:10%
and universal peace
versus endless war.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
existential choice we're

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
facing, and we
have to find a way

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to come together as a
community and a people

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to assure that there's this
good future that happens.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so in the end, the
solution is not physical,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
at least because
there is no physical.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's perception.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
See, what we're doing
is we are interacting

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
with this reality, this
quantum level of reality

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
where all possibility
and probability is

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be made manifest.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And we are taking from that
quantum possibility-probability

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:10%
a frequency band of
possibility and probability

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:10%
that relates to our
sense of perception.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
that you are little me,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
then the frequency
you are operating on

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and the scale of that
frequency is absolutely tiny.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you
re-self-identify and say,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm all that
is, has been, and ever

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
can be having this
experience, then

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
you start to operate not only
on a much higher frequency

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
but a much more expanded
level of frequency.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:10%
So now you're interacting
with this quantum

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:10%
level of possibility
and probability

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:10%
in a much more expansive
way, and you're no longer

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:10%
operating within
the frequency band,

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:10%
because that's what
it is, of this matrix.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
You might still
be perceiving it,

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
but you're not being
deceived by it because you're

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
no longer controlled
by its perceptions

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
because you're
somewhere else now.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And instead of when you are in
phantom-self little me mode,

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
you're standing
next to something

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of fuzzy and out
of focus and a reddish color,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
work it out, you

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:84%
start to step back as you
expand your awareness.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you're seeing,
actually, it was a brick.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.362 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, the brick's
part of the wall, and the wall

00:21:49.362 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is part of a house,
and part of a street.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And, suddenly, as you
expand your awareness

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
by expanding your sense of
self, that's how it's done,

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:90%
who is the "I"?

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:10%
Ethel on the checkout or all
that is, has been, and ever

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:10%
can be?

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
You're now at the
top of the hill

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:90%
and you can see the panorama.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
forest, symbolically,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
because before you could
only see the twigs.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
You're basically
taking the headset off.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
You're taking the gloves off.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the
earphones off, and you're

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
seeing what is there to be
seen beyond the matrix, which

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:90%
is a frequency band.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But everything we
have ever believed,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
everything we've ever
thought, everything

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
we think we have
ever perceived, has

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
been an illusion,
a fake, a computer

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
game to enslave up our
perception and sense of self.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's no surprise
that we live in a madhouse.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:90%
This world is insane.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:90%
The world is an inversion.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look, the
world is an inversion.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we have been
manipulated to do, well,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
those that have not
stepped off the stamp,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
they've been
manipulated to believe

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
that complete insanity is sane
and that people who are sane

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
are insane.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.355 align:middle line:90%
It's an inversion.

00:23:08.355 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
inversion on purpose.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's an inversion
that's systematic.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's inversion
that must be righted

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to change
this because you do not

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
change the road
you're walking down

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:90%
by continuing to walk down it.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
You change by
changing direction.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Even more than that, you change
by changing perception and then

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:90%
everything changes.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:84%
We can only be manipulated by
operating within the frequency

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%
band that they manipulate.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You see, we look at this world
and we see it as physical,

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
but the real deal is
going on at deeper levels.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going on at
the waveform level.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking at
as we look at this world

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:84%
is a movie screen, and you
don't change a movie screen.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:54.638 align:middle line:90%
It's a done deal.

00:23:54.638 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
See, at the screen,
there's no one standing

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
on a stage of a movie theater
screaming at the screen

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.605 align:middle line:90%
and telling the movie to change.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:90%
It ain't gonna change.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:90%
It's happened.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
where it's coming from.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:84%
That's where changing our
frequency changes everything

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
because we change where
we're coming from.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
If we, collectively, can
change our perception,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
we'll change the reality
of which this is just

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
a reflection.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, people, they talk
about protest and waving

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:90%
banners and all that stuff.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what the system wants.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:90%
He wants divided rule.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But the way to change
hijacked perception,

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
which is creating
this hijacked reality,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:84%
is to change our perception
so it's no longer hijacked.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult sometimes to get
this across because it's not

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
what you normally hear, but
we have to change perception

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to change the movie.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And perception, when
we change perception,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
it's changing our frequency,
it's changing how we vibrate,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
it's changing what
we're interacting with.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally change
perception and dismantle this.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
What the world is at the
moment is a collective creation

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:90%
of collective human perception.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just a feedback loop.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Perception is experience
leads to perception leads

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of the waveform world
into the holographic world,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
perception, experience,
perception, experience.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
We change this bit, the
perception, the experience

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they don't
work so hard to keep us

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in a low vibrational state.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't work so hard to
hijack our perception of self

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's a laugh
and a bit of fun.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They do it because without
it they can't control us.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
We should not think
of ourselves as being

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:84%
human beings in a physical
body being controlled.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not who we are.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
projection that we decode.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We are infinite awareness
capable of changing anything,

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
the answers lie.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
This is where the answers
lie because if we tried

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to change this
world in this world,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:84%
they're laughing at us because
they know it will never change.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:10%
It's like Einstein said on a
much more this-world level,

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:10%
you can't solve problems with
the same level of awareness

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.862 align:middle line:10%
that created them.

00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
doing, but we're doing it

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
at a much deeper level.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And if we can re-self-identify
our sense of who

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:84%
we are from little-me,
phantom-me to infinite-me,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
the transformation in
the collective reality

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that that will create
will change everything.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds trite, and
I know it sounds simplistic.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:10%
It will change everything.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:10%
Because what we
would like to change

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:10%
is a manifestation of the
collective perceptual state

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:10%
of humanity.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't change
that, this will continue.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The more we give our
power away to technology,

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
the more the technology
will invade us.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The more we give power
to our infinite self

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and our infinite
possibility, the more

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that will manifest within this
world and not a control system.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
A control system cannot
manipulate infinite awareness

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and awareness of itself.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:10%
Because, A, it sees through
the manipulation, and B,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:10%
it's operating on such
a level of insight,

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:10%
such a level of wisdom, such
a level of energetic power

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:10%
and perceptual power
and manifestation power

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:10%
that these entities that
people think are so powerful,

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:10%
it's a fly on an elephant's
back to awareness and awareness

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:10%
of itself.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's not to
Ethel on the checkout

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
when Ethel thinks she's
Ethel on the checkout

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and not infinite awareness
having an experience called

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.688 align:middle line:90%
Ethel on the checkout.

00:28:11.688 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the perceptual
transformation

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:90%
that has to take place.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't, then
nothing will change.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
This is why, whenever I talk
about anything, whenever

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I write books, I never
write a book without this.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Because without this, you're
just talking about a problem,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you're not talking
about how we change it.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Recognizing that we all live
in the matrix is the first step

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:90%
in breaking free of it.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
All of humanity can be
set free from this prison

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
by embracing and expanding
our infinite awareness.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:90%
