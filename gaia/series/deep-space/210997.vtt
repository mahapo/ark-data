>> From Egypt to
Babylon, India to Japan,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
ancient history is rich with
myths and legends of feline

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
beings that were worshipped
as gods and goddesses.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But were these
catlike entities more

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
than symbolic
representations of power?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Could they have been an ancient
race of extraterrestrials known

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
by some as the Urmah, who
came to Earth contributing

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
to the evolution of humankind?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If so, what is known about
this exclusive species

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
that were once

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:90%
an influence in ancient times?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And why do we no longer
witness their presence today?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.295 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So while we don't know
as much about the felines

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:10%
and the Urmah as
we do, let's say,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:10%
the Greys or the reptilians
that are very prominent in pop

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:10%
culture and that we are
gaining more and more awareness

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:10%
of, what we do know is that
these Urmah had a very strong,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:10%
powerful place in
humanity's past.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:10%
They were one of the
foundational influences

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:10%
on what it meant to have human
civilization for that time

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:10%
>> In ancient Egypt, the cat was
absolutely revered as sacred.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:10%
And attached to the cat were
ideas or characteristics

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:10%
like righteousness,
strength, power, royalty.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
tombs in ancient Egypt,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
you'll find them buried
with statues of cats.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
why is because they

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
want to connect themselves with
those ultimate characteristics

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of the feline race,
of the leonine race,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that righteousness,
power, and majesty.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
In the "Book of the Dead," Ra is
shown with a knife in his hand,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
killing the serpent
of chaos, because cats

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:90%
are ferocious killers, too.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And then Ra's daughter,
Bastet, takes the form

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:10%
of a humanoid cat being.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Are these really
feline, humanoid beings

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
as the Egyptians
insisted they were?

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
What if they were?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Sekhmet is well known
as a feline goddess.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:10%
She's a humanoid cat.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And she's, in fact,
the consort or wife

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:10%
of Ptah, who came from
Sirius, and the Egyptians

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:10%
said was their god of technology
who fashioned the human body.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:90%
So why is Ptah mated with a cat?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Is this a feline race
that came from Sirius?

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Or where did they come from?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We're never told where
the felines originated.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We're just told that they're
a very important part

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:90%
of Egyptian creation mythology.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:10%
Murry Hope was a
great mythologist

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:10%
and wrote extensively
about Sirius

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:10%
since she called
them the Paschats.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Paschat is a French
word for cat.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
They came from Sirius.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
She said the lion
people in ancient Egypt

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%
were a feline race.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They were actually a feline race
that she called the Paschats.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is well ingrained
in Egyptian mythology

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that the cat people were
actually real people.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:10%
>> According to ancient
civilization researchers,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:10%
the Giza Plateau is
significantly older than

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:10%
mainstream academia propose,
and can be dated back tens

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:10%
of thousands of years to
a time known as Zep Tepi,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:10%
when the Earth was aligned
with the constellation of Leo.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the connection with Leo

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
is more than simply a
celestial alignment?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Might it be a clue for a
technologically advanced

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
feline presence on
Earth during that time,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
a time before the Great
Deluge and the destruction

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there is enough
evidence we have there that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:10%
these depictions show
lion-headed beings interacting

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:10%
with humanity.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
know their association

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
with the age of Leo
is very important

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
because we see
Leo, the lion king,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
being a very important
part of astrotheology.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:10%
>> The Sphinx originally used
to be a lion-headed being.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:10%
And, eventually, in
later time periods,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:10%
that lion face was reshaped
to be a human face.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is a very
strong likelihood

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx was not
only a representation

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Age of Leo, which
was the time of Zep

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Tepi, the original
time when things

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
was the origin of
human civilization.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But it may also be an
indication of the Urmah presence

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
at the time period of Zep
Tepi and Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I think a lot of the stories
that we see in ancient Egypt

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:10%
about these different gods
and goddesses are pointing

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:10%
to a unified prediluvian
civilization,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:10%
which we would call Atlantis,
and some would call Lemuria

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:10%
before that or Mu.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And these are clearly
times when humanity

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
had advanced levels
of technology

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of specific
kinds of sites and structures,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
things that we don't know
how to build now that they

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:90%
were able to build with ease.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, I believe that a lot
of the galactic interface

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and influence that was happening
during Atlantean times,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and prior to the Flood,
last in our stories

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
today as mythologies, as the
stories of gods and goddesses.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But that these
are, in many ways,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
beings that were hybridized from
the stars that were actually

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet at
one time or another.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout history,
individuals of prominence,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:10%
with their powerful bloodlines,
have often aligned themselves

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:10%
and their families to
images of animals as symbols

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:10%
of their power.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Such as the dragons with
many Asian emperors,

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
or the lion with
European monarchies.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But could these animal icons
be more than just symbols?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Are they unveiling
an esoteric lineage

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
of genetically
modified humans with

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
other extraterrestrial races?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting concept
to think about the feline

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol of power, because if
they were these ancient rulers

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times, wouldn't that
lend credence as to why we talk

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
about lion as being like
not only the king of beasts,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
but as a symbol of royalty
and a symbol of power?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
That maybe this is some
of these royal lines,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:84%
not claiming
lineage, but claiming

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that they have that
divine right to rule,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:90%
that divine right of power?

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they saw it
at one point in time

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that prestige and that
royalty conveyed by the Urmah

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are trying
to emulate that

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
throughout their own
family line of royalty.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So the lion could be
a symbol of royalty

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
because of the ancient
influence of the Urmah on Earth.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> People will look at images
of serpent gods and say, oh,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
they're reptilian.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about the same
now when we come back

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
to all these leonine images?

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Even in modern eras, you have
monarchies and royal people

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that use the lion as their
icon or as their totem animal.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it just because
they're trying

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to connect themselves with the
characteristics of the felines?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Or are they saying
that they originated

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
from that leonine race?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:10%
When we look for the continuing
evolution or influence

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:10%
of the felines or
the leonine race,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:10%
I often point to the Essenes,
the tribe of Jewish mystics

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:10%
that they operated
in Alexandria, Egypt.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.073 align:middle line:10%
And then they operated in Qumran
and in Carmel and elsewhere.

00:08:22.073 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And what most
people don't know is

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes built a
duplicate of Solomon's temple

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They built it at a place
called Leontopolis,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:90%
the city of the lion.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And they specifically went
to the city of the lion

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to build this duplicate
of Solomon's temple.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they introduced the
lion of the tribe of Judah.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I find that really interesting.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's this
tribe of Jewish mystics

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that are going back into ancient
Egyptian lore and saying,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:90%
it's got to be at Leontopolis.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be the
city of the lion

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
because the Lion of the
tribe of Judah is on his way.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And you think, are they
bringing in a being

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
that has these qualities?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Or are they literally
trying to influence

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
human affairs to bring out a
more leonine type of lineage?

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You find this in the
story of King Solomon.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
King Solomon had a lion throne.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And the lion symbolized
majesty and royalty.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But does it symbolize
perhaps more than that?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
He's actually connecting
himself with this leonine race.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And then 900 years later, we
have another family member

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
from the tribe of Judah,
Jesus, who's called

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:90%
the Lion of the tribe of Judah.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And he has all of these
leonine characteristics.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:90%
He's powerful.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't mess with him.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
He's a great healer, and he has
these advanced capabilities.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Are they really
trying to connect

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
the family, the tribe of Judah
and the beings in ancient Egypt

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:90%
with a leonine race?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that literal?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it allegorical, metaphorical?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that
the leonine race did

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
come here and create an earthly
lineage, you have to wonder,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how well is
that lineage doing?

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's
aspects of ourselves

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
that we still have to tap into.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems like the felines
kind of dropped out of favor

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.050 align:middle line:10%
with the advent of Christianity.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:10%
I think for a while
there in Earth's history,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:10%
they were actually
demonized, where

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:10%
felines were seen as
witches' familiars,

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:10%
or they were seen as
demonic beings that

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:10%
were bringing in demons.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were kind of
almost wiped out in Europe

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
during the Middle Ages
because of this superstition

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
against felines, which
was a direct opposition

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptian times when
feline beings were elevated.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why there with
such a hatred of feline beings

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
was because they were
always a natural enemies

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of the reptilian.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
These beings were in
opposition to each other

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.725 align:middle line:84%
ever since the days
of Lyra and Vega.

00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In the constellation of Lyra,
there is a star called Vega

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
around which orbits planets that
researchers suggest the feline

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials came from.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:84%
After a war with the
reptilian race known

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
as the Draco that saw the
destruction of their home

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
planet, the feline race
dispersed throughout the galaxy

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to become one of the most
widespread and prolific species

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:90%
in the known star systems.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Felines are a
fascinating group of beings.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The felines, my
understanding from what

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I've seen in the
Akashic records,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is that they were a group of
beings that actually originated

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
from a different universe.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So these were beings
that held the evolution

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
of a multiuniverse that
was not our universe.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Then when that
experimentation of separation

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
from reality or separation
into reality ended,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
they came to help start the
process in our universe.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So they came in through
a different portal

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to our galactic center
in order to create

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:84%
physical versions of
themselves in the Lyran system.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
our ET contactees,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
like Ashayana Deane in
her "Voyager" series,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
these beings existed at a much
higher dimensional levels.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:84%
When we look at them
having something

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
like 12 strands of
DNA, it was said

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:84%
that they could come through
certain portals and stargates

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:90%
around our planet.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, they were
able to interface with us

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and move through
these places in ways

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
the capabilities to

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:90%
with our current DNA.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There are several strong
lineages of felines that I

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
believe have
interacted with Earth.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
One of these particular
racial lines I believe

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
Sirian system and are

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
known by some as the
Sirian white lions.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Many others come from
the Lyran star system,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
where we have a variety of
different humanoid cat races.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, I believe that
a lot of the Lyran cat races

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and species are warriors that
have worked with other races

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.305 align:middle line:84%
to provide security and
guardianship around the galaxy.

00:13:49.305 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The Urmah would be classed
as probably one of the most

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:10%
prolific of the races in
that they are in all corners

00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:10%
of the universe and have many,
many colonies everywhere.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So they are definitely
prolific probably more so

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> When they dress up,
they like to wear finery.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They like to have their capes.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They like to have their
blue jumpsuit-type things.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And they put decorations
on it, so they're

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
very showy and very flashy.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
From the way they talk, you can
imagine as if a lion or a tiger

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:90%
were talking.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
They would still have
that growly, rumbly sound

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:90%
when they talk.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they
have a telepathic influence.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Most folks that have
interactions with these feline

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
beings tell us that
they're a highly advanced,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional, or
metaterrestrial race that is

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with us from a
higher dimensional level.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they will see
different outlines of them,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
be more transparent,
that they have

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
a metamorphic and telepathic
way of communicating,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and that they are a
higher-evolved race.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Also, these feline
beings have been said

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to be very wise, very kind.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they were warlike.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look at
the history with cats

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
when we go back into
ancient Egypt even.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they venerated them.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They are extreme warriors,
I mean to the extreme.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:84%
They are known to be circulated
throughout the universe.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:90%
They have colonies everywhere.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
They number in the trillions.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And they are very, very
fierce fighters so much so

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that even the ruling class,
Draco, that are so large

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:90%
are actually afraid of them.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They do wear uniforms
with different insignias

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
group they belong to

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.380 align:middle line:84%
or rank if they're in the
military type of stuff

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Females are just as fierce, just
as loving, and very protective

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of their young.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So far as I know,
they originated

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:90%
or came from the Vegan system.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Their planets' names
were Lyor and Avalon.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Their society is structured
as ours pretty much

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
as a holistic society or
a holographic society,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Holistic is another term
or word for what we used

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:90%
to call holographic societies.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
People got confused with that
because they kept thinking

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%
that it was a hologram.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not in that respect.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.215 align:middle line:84%
But it is to some
degree because as you

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
know, if you take a hologram,
if you cut a little corner off

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
of it, that little corner
contains everything

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:90%
that the whole had contained.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a similarity
in the respect

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that every person is a
reflection of the entire whole

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic society.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And every piece exists for
the purpose of every piece.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> My experiences with some
of the Lyran humanoid species

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of catlike beings tend to show
me that this species is very

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
interested in sports and
movement, in dynamic art forms,

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
in battles, but battles for
growth and learning and show,

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.999 align:middle line:84%
but also have a level of
peacefulness and reservedness,

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
where there is a contemplation
about the understandings

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of the unfoldings of
the archetypes in time,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, and awareness that
there is cultural narratives

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and cycles that repeat
themselves over history.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The catlike beings, I think,
we experience here on Earth

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
even as house cats
can carry both

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
this vicious intensity, but also
this deeply gentle sweetness.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I find that that's true
of almost all the feline races

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
that I've encountered.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> These beings were known
to be fierce fighters.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
They actually played
a huge role in trying

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to defend Lyra against
the attacks of Draco.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I think there would have
been more casualties in Lyra

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and Vega if it hadn't been
for the fighting abilities

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:90%
of these cat beings, you know.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
They were quite fearsome.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And they had, I
think, skills that

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
enabled them to take
down a lot of Draconians

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:90%
in hand-to-hand combat.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
The Draconians, although they're
quite fearsome in themselves,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
are no match for the cat beings.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They love to express
themselves physically.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Because of their influence
in the sense of protection

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of
fighting abilities,

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a reason
why they remain connected

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
with the Galactic
Federation, where

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they lend their fighting skills
and their physical abilities

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to help
other star systems

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to evolve in these
areas, where we

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
can learn how to
protect ourselves,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:84%
where we can learn how
to have, I would say,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
a high level of ethics,
a high level of integrity

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
but still be excellent
fighters, still

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
have those defense
skills that are

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
going to help us to
get from the level

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that we are now
to the next level.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
some researchers,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the felines have a substantial
role within the Galactic

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Federation and are considered
one of the wisest beings

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It is said that they
often act as guides

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to the other races that have
not made the evolutionary leap

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to higher dimensional beings.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The Lyran star species and
cultures that are feline are

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
part of this galactic
community and galactic council.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
They operate with a level of
grace and knowledge and wisdom

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that essentially makes
them extraordinary teachers

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and guides and guardians for
other races around the galaxy.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I have only had incredibly
beautiful and powerful

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
experiences with those
that either reincarnated

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
from these species and
brought some of their wisdom

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
or through direct
contact with these beings

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
at different moments
in my journey

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
exploring these
different galactic races.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The feline groups, because
they've had their influences

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in other star systems besides
Lyra's, they also became

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
supporters of the
Galactic Federation.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people
will report, you know,

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
their interactions with
Galactic Federation ships.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And they go on board the ships,
and they see representations

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:90%
of feline beings.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So there are
certain feline souls

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that have chosen to be, I think
still stay in physical form

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
in order to be of
support because they have

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
a specific mission that
involves maybe some other star

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
systems or planet Earth.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So they have chosen to
remain in physical form

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
so that they can maintain a
direct involvement with some

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
of these ascension projects
throughout our galaxy.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The Urmah are a very
prominent part of the Galactic

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Federation they are one of the
big prominent members from what

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
we understand.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
They have this very
strong presence,

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that they are manning
a lot of the ships

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and running a lot
of the programs that

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
are protective and oriented,
because while these beings may

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.593 align:middle line:84%
be kind and fun and happy,
they tend to be overbloviated.

00:21:44.593 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And they like to
have their finery

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and their decorative symbols
and all the other decorations.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But they are also very powerful,
very strong, very warlike.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And they help to guide a lot
of these military operations

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:90%
to protect planets.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:10%
>> As well as being protectors,
the felines are also considered

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:10%
to be master geneticists,
according to contactees

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:10%
and channelers.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Part of their agenda to
help guide various species

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
starts with altering
the DNA makeup of beings

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
to help them evolve.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Some have claimed
that they even had

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
a role in manipulating the DNA
of Homo sapiens on our planet.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Some researchers I've come
across have suggested that

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
these feline-like beings have
seeded parts of our genetic

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
traits through our DNA by
influencing the morphogenetic

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
field of the Earth.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the
morphogenetic field,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
according to Rupert Sheldrake,
is this field of information

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're receiving
through our DNA, which

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
acts like an antenna.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you might say that these
beings have 12 strands of DNA,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
as it's been suggested, and
that they're very advanced

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and act as sort of
engineers, if you will.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The feline beings were one
of the founder races that seeded

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:10%
planet Earth.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we see such a
wide variety of feline genetics

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:10%
throughout the animal
kingdom and also

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:10%
even within humankind itself.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So these beings were
actually master geneticists.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability to create
different races of beings

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
using their own DNA.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So, initially, in
the history of Lyra,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
we see many evolutions
of these beings

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
where, initially, they were
super high dimensional.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And they had more of a
felinesque look about them.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So there was various versions
of these hybridized feline

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If feline extraterrestrials
had a role in seeding

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
or manipulating our DNA, to
what end are they engineering

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
our species on a
biological level?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the interaction
between humans and the Urmah,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
they would look upon us as
definitely needing help.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They show a great deal
of empathy toward us.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
They would tend to protect us.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that in most cases,
if anyone should meet one,

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
they would probably
be frightened

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
because of the appearance.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's, again, something
that humans need to work on.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to
look beyond appearance

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and look to that so-called
spiritual side, which

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is the inner person, the inner
self, the thing that actually

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
makes the person what
it is, and that there

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
would be a great deal of
affection and connection

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
they are any kind

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
of a race that would be feared.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I think they should
be welcomed openly

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than in the kind
of close or quiet spaces

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:90%
that they have at this point.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But that's entirely
up to humanity

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly we evolve
to where we can do that.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> My gut feeling on these
feline beings is they came here

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
ages ago as
protectors, as guides,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and that they are still
here in one form or another

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:90%
as protectors, as guides.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And we see them
through the starseeds.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We see them through
the indirect actions

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that they take to
influence here.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they have a very
strong presence on the surface

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:90%
of our planet anymore.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think they are more
celestial-oriented They're

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.212 align:middle line:84%
more out in space and protecting
things coming in and out.

00:25:37.212 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
From the research
we've been doing,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the Urmah are protecting us
primarily from the reptilian,

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
from the Dracos that
are still trying

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:90%
to take over and run things.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:10%
We know from inner sources
that the Draco have definitely

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:10%
infiltrated subversively
into governments

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:10%
and into corporations and into
the underground of the world.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
reptilians, the Dracos

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
have not been able to
launch full-fledged

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
invasions and destructive
campaigns to our planet.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And that may be because of the
Urmah keeping protective guard

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and holding the quarantine
so that they cannot do these

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
invasions on our planet.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The relationship we have
with these feline beings

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
traditionally also, when we go
back into our ancient cultures

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations, is
that they were helping us.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:90%
They were giving us light.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
They were helping to grow
and evolve our biology

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.325 align:middle line:84%
as well as look
over our progress.

00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>> With the prevalence of a
feline influence on humanity

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient past, the
question arises as to why we no

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:10%
longer see these
catlike species today.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers suggest
that these beings

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
might dwell outside of
this third density, which

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is why contact today is
mostly through dreams,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing, or nonlocal
conscious communications.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> There hasn't been many
incidences of direct,

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say, contactee
experiences with feline beings

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
on this planet or even elsewhere
because these beings have long

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
since evolved.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They oftentimes if there's
people that channel them

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:84%
or people that
connect with them,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:84%
it's usually from a
very ethereal realm.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't say there's a whole
lot of incidences even today

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:10%
where we would see these beings
in the third dimension or even

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:10%
in the fourth dimension.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:10%
They've evolved way beyond that.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
many accounts of people

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
who have channeled
these beings, who

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
have these beings as their
personal guides and teachers.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
some correlation

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
where there's some of these
beings that remain in somewhat

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of a higher-level
physical form in order

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be of
service to the Galactic

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Federation or other agencies,
you know, similar to that.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But they're on much
higher dimensional forms.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
necessarily going to see

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of
incidences where there's

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
people that have had 3D
encounters with felines.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a very interesting
question to ponder,

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we know from ancient
artifacts and ancient writings

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that these Urmah beings
had such a prominent role

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:90%
in early human civilization.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But then just one day,
they seem to leave.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, fascinatingly
enough, there

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
are interesting reports of the
work of the Galactic Federation

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
about the quarantine on
Earth and the covenant

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that these
extraterrestrial races

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
can no longer be overtly
connecting and communicating

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:90%
with humanity.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But we do have reports that
the Urmah haven't really

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
left yet, that they are
in orbit around Earth

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
still holding a protective
place over the quarantine

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:59.150 align:middle line:84%
of our planet and overseeing the
protective operations to keep

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
us safe from outside threats.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> As we attempt to better
understand these feline beings

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:84%
who are one of the main groups
of influence upon our human

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
ancestors, one can
only speculate about

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:84%
their intentions for humanity
as being a supportive one.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Many of us love cats.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have deep
connections with cats.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We experience a sort of
telepathic and emotional bond

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:90%
with our animals.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's likely that that
bond is not a new thing.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We go back to ancient Egypt,
and we hear stories of cats

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:84%
there that we had
this deep bond with.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But we also see
different information

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
pointing to a more profound bond
between us and feline species

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:90%
both here on Earth and beyond.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of
what we know now about felines

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and how we interact with
cats and the kinds of gifts

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
they bring to our daily
experience in life

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:84%
comes from this
longer relationship

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have with
different feline species

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth and
across the stars.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So, ultimately, we can
see the Urmah as the big cat

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
protectors of the
galaxy and of Earth,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
that they are these amazing,
fantastic creatures that have

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:90%
great emotion, great energy.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They are at a
higher-level of being.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But we should be grateful
that they're here

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
because things could be a
whole lot worse on our planet

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
if they weren't
watching over us,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.540 align:middle line:84%
protecting us, and
ultimately guiding us

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:90%
in one form or another.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So the big takeaway
about the Urmah--

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:84%
big lovable cats
keeping you safe.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth is a menagerie.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It's got so much diversity.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And we hear this
refrain over and over

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
in extraterrestrial studies
that other planets are

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:84%
homogeneous in terms of the
type of beings that are there.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth,
we've got them all.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Some propose that
that's why Earth

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is sort of quarantined,
why we're isolated out here

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:90%
because it's a grand experiment.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how all
the various races

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
from all these different
star systems and members

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Galactic Federation can
come together in one place.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And let's see what happens and
how they can all live together.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:84%
If Earth is this
experimental world,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that would explain why we have
this infusion of so much DNA

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
from all these different star
systems and types of beings.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where this type
of diversity is encouraged,

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's allowed.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And it ultimately then
becomes the hallmark of Earth.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what all
this is leading to

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
is the birth of a new type of
being coming from Earth that

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:84%
is representative of all
of these different races

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and now becomes the new
model that will then

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.520 align:middle line:84%
be taken to different
star systems beyond those

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that we're even aware of now.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> As we conclude season
4 of "Deep Space,"

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
consider the following:
extraterrestrial species from

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:84%
across the universe have
influenced the evolution

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:90%
of humankind.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We see evidence of this
from our ancient past

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and continue to experience
their contact to this day.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The human race
stands collectively

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
on the threshold of
change as we transition

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
into a new paradigm of humanity
joined by our galactic family.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
In the words of
Colonel Philip Corso

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
when he asked an
extraterrestrial visitor,

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:84%
quote, "What do you
have to offer us?"

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The ET responded, "A new
world, if you can take it."

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:90%
That new world is now upon us.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.430 align:middle line:90%

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:90%
